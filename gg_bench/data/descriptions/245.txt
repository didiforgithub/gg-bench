# Blockade Runner

### Rule Book

---

## Objective

Be the first player to move your token from your starting position to your opponent's starting position on a linear board. Achieve victory by strategically moving your token forward and placing blockades to hinder your opponent's progress. You win by either reaching the opponent's starting space or by blocking your opponent so they cannot make a legal move.

---

## Setup

- **Board Layout**: A linear board consisting of **11 consecutive spaces**, numbered from **0** to **10**.
  - **Space 0**: Player 1's starting position.
  - **Space 10**: Player 2's starting position.
  - **Spaces 1-9**: Neutral spaces that can be occupied, moved through, or blocked.
- **Player Tokens**:
  - **Player 1**: Starts on **Space 0**.
  - **Player 2**: Starts on **Space 10**.
- **Blockades**: No blockades are on the board at the start.

---

## Game Components

- **Linear Board**: A simple representation of 11 spaces in a straight line.
- **Player Tokens**:
  - **Player 1 Token**: Represented as `P1`.
  - **Player 2 Token**: Represented as `P2`.
- **Blockades**: Represented as `X` on the board.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via a CLI that displays the board and accepts player inputs.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Each turn consists of two actions in order**:
  1. **Move Action**:
     - Move your token **1 or 2 spaces forward** toward your opponent's starting position.
     - Movement is only allowed onto unoccupied and unblocked spaces.
  2. **Blockade Action**:
     - Place a blockade (`X`) on any unoccupied and unblocked space **except the starting spaces (0 and 10)**.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Legal Moves**:
  - You may move **1** or **2** spaces forward.
  - You cannot move onto or past a space occupied by a blockade or the opponent's token.
- **Blocked Movement**:
  - If you have no legal moves (both options blocked), you lose the game.
  - You cannot skip your move; you must move if possible.

### Blockade Placement Rules

- **Placing Blockades**:
  - After moving, you must place a blockade on any valid space.
  - Valid spaces are unoccupied, unblocked, and not the starting positions.
- **Blockade Restrictions**:
  - Once placed, blockades remain for the rest of the game.
  - You cannot remove or move blockades.

### Winning the Game

You win by:

- **Reaching the Opponent's Starting Space**:
  - Successfully moving your token onto space **10** (for Player 1) or space **0** (for Player 2).
- **Blocking Your Opponent**:
  - If your opponent has no legal moves on their turn due to blockades and your token's position, they lose.

### Special Conditions

- **No Backward Movement**:
  - Players cannot move backward; only forward movement is allowed.
- **Occupied Spaces**:
  - Players cannot occupy the same space.
- **End of Game Scenarios**:
  - If neither player can move, the **last player who moved** wins.

## Scoring

- There are no points or scoring system.
- The game outcome is simply a win or loss based on the objective.
