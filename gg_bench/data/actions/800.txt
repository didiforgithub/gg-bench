In the action space of the game, index 0 corresponds to the "Take" action, where the player removes the topmost number from the stack and adds it to their score area. Index 1 corresponds to the "Skip" action, where the player passes their turn without taking any action, potentially leading to discarding the top number if both players skip consecutively.
