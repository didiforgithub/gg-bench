# Multiplication Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

Multiplication Duel is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to avoid being the player who causes the shared number to reach or exceed a predefined target number. Players take turns multiplying the shared number by an integer within a specified range. The player who forces the shared number to reach or surpass the target number loses the game. Victory requires careful calculation and foresight to outmaneuver your opponent.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared number set to **1**.
- **Target Number**: A predefined target number, typically **100**, is set before the game starts.
- **Player Order**: Determine which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be decided randomly or by agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A single integer that both players manipulate during the game, starting at **1**.
- **Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive. These are the numbers players can choose to multiply the shared number.
- **Target Number**: The number that players must avoid reaching or exceeding; default is **100**.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Player Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must:
    1. Choose a multiplier between **2** and **9**.
    2. Multiply the shared number by the chosen multiplier.
    3. Update the shared number with the new value.
- **End of Turn**: After updating the shared number, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing a Multiplier**:
   - Players must select an integer multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - Only integers within this range are valid; choosing an invalid multiplier results in losing the game by default.

2. **Updating the Shared Number**:
   - Multiply the current shared number by the chosen multiplier.
   - For example, if the shared number is **5** and the player chooses **3**, the new shared number is **15**.

3. **Winning and Losing Conditions**:
   - The player whose action causes the shared number to reach or exceed the target number (e.g., **100**) **loses** the game.
   - The opposing player is declared the **winner**.
   - If a player inputs an invalid multiplier, they automatically lose.

4. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. It will always result in a win or loss based on the above conditions.

5. **Example Valid Turn**:
   - Shared number is **4**.
   - Player chooses multiplier **5**.
   - New shared number is **4 × 5 = 20**.

6. **Example Losing Turn**:
   - Shared number is **51**.
   - Player chooses multiplier **2**.
   - New shared number is **51 × 2 = 102**.
   - Since **102** exceeds the target **100**, the player loses.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Tracking**:
  - A single point is awarded for each game won.
  - Players can keep track of total wins over multiple games to determine overall proficiency.
- **No Point System Within a Game**:
  - There is no incremental scoring within a single game; it is a win/lose outcome.

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 1
   - **Action**: Chooses multiplier **9**
   - **Calculation**: 1 × 9 = **9**
   - **New Shared Number**: 9

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 9
   - **Action**: Chooses multiplier **6**
   - **Calculation**: 9 × 6 = **54**
   - **New Shared Number**: 54

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 54
   - **Action**: Chooses multiplier **2**
   - **Calculation**: 54 × 2 = **108**
   - **New Shared Number**: 108
   - **Outcome**: Shared number **108** exceeds target **100**.
   - **Result**: Player 1 loses, Player 2 wins.

### Strategic Notes

- **Avoid Dangerous Multipliers**:
  - Be cautious when the shared number is close to the target. Selecting a high multiplier may force you to lose.
- **Force Your Opponent's Hand**:
  - Try to leave the shared number at a value where any multiplier they choose will cause them to exceed the target.
- **Calculation and Prediction**:
  - Anticipate future shared numbers based on possible multipliers your opponent can choose.
