# Number Slide: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

**Number Slide** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach a total score of exactly **15** by strategically adding or subtracting numbers from a shared sequence. Players must carefully choose numbers and operations to manipulate their total score while anticipating their opponent's moves. The game ends when a player successfully reaches the target score of 15.

## Setup

1. **Shared Sequence**: Create a shared sequence of numbers arranged in a single row. The sequence consists of the digits from **1** to **9** arranged in ascending order:

   ```
   [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
   ```

2. **Player Totals**: Both players start with a **total score of 0**.

3. **Player Order**: Decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Shared Sequence**: The central element of the game is the sequence of numbers from 1 to 9. These numbers are accessible to both players and form the pool from which numbers are selected during the game.

- **Player Totals**: Each player maintains their own total score, starting at 0. This total is updated each turn based on the number selected and the operation performed.

- **Operations**: Players can choose to **add** or **subtract** the selected number to or from their total score.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Select a Number**: On your turn, choose a number from **either end** (the first or last number) of the shared sequence.
  2. **Choose an Operation**: Decide whether to **add** or **subtract** the chosen number to/from your total score.
  3. **Update the Sequence**: Remove the selected number from the shared sequence.
  4. **Update Total Score**: Apply the operation and adjust your total score accordingly.
  5. **Announce Move**: Declare your chosen number, operation, and new total score.
  6. **Check for Win Condition**: If your total score is exactly 15, you win the game.

- **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until the game ends. Ensure that each player's actions are clearly communicated to maintain game flow.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - You may only select a number from either **end** of the shared sequence (i.e., the first or last remaining number).
   - Once a number is selected and removed, it is no longer available for either player.

2. **Operations**:
   - After selecting a number, you must choose to **add** or **subtract** it from your current total score.
   - Your total score can be **positive**, **negative**, or **zero** during the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The **first player** to reach a total score of **exactly 15** wins the game.
   - If both players reach 15 on the same round, the game continues until a player reaches 15 while the opponent does not.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (e.g., no numbers remain in the sequence), the game continues until a win condition is met.
   - Players **cannot skip** their turn; a number must be selected if available.

5. **End of the Sequence**:
   - The game can continue even if all numbers have been used, as the win condition depends solely on reaching a total score of 15.
   - If neither player reaches 15 after all numbers have been used, the game ends in a **loss for both players**.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Scores**:
  - Each player keeps a running total of their score after each turn.
  - Scores are updated based on the selected number and chosen operation.

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The **sole scoring objective** is to reach a total score of **exactly 15**.
  - There are no additional points or scoring mechanisms.

## Strategy Tips

- **Balance Addition and Subtraction**: Consider both adding and subtracting numbers to reach the target score of 15 efficiently.

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Pay attention to the sequence and strategize to limit your opponent's options or force them into undesirable moves.

- **Sequence Control**: By choosing certain numbers, you can manipulate the sequence to your advantage, potentially controlling which numbers will be available on your next turn.

- **Avoid Overshooting**: Be cautious about increasing your total score too quickly, as it may limit your options in later turns.
