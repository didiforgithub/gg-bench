**Game Name: Factor Frenzy**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to reduce the shared positive integer **N** exactly to **1** by strategically dividing it by its prime factors. The player who successfully reduces **N** to **1** on their turn wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move because **N** is already **1** before their turn, they lose.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Choose Starting Number**: Decide on a positive integer **N** greater than **1** to start the game. A common starting value is **100**, but players can agree on any suitable number.
   
2. **Display**: Both players are informed of the starting number **N**. In a command-line interface, **N** is displayed prominently for both players at the beginning and after each turn.

3. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that both players will manipulate. It changes value as the game progresses based on players' actions.

- **Prime Numbers**: Fundamental components in the game used for dividing **N**. Players must identify prime factors of **N** during their turns.

- **Command-Line Interface**: Since the game is played in a command-line environment, inputs and outputs are text-based. Players input their chosen prime factors, and the updated value of **N** is displayed after each turn.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Player Action**: On their turn, the player must:
   - **Identify** the prime factors of the current **N**.
   - **Choose** one of these prime factors (**P**) to divide **N**.

2. **Execution**:
   - **Divide** **N** by the chosen prime factor **P**: \( N = \frac{N}{P} \).
   - **Update**: The new value of **N** is displayed for both players.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Players alternate turns.
   - The game continues until one player reduces **N** to **1** or a player cannot make a valid move.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the player divides **N** by a prime factor of **N**.
   - The chosen prime factor **P** must be a divisor of **N** (i.e., \( N \mod P = 0 \)).

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces **N** to exactly **1** on their turn, they win the game.

3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If **N** is **1** before a player's turn, they cannot make a move and thus lose the game.

4. **Special Cases**:
   - When **N** is a prime number greater than **1**, the only valid move is to divide **N** by itself, resulting in **N = 1**.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players must make a move if a valid one is available.

6. **Fair Play**:
   - Players should perform calculations carefully to avoid errors in prime factor identification.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**: The player who reduces **N** to **1** on their turn wins the game.
- **Loss**: The player who cannot make a valid move because **N** is **1** at the start of their turn loses the game.
- No points are tracked beyond determining the winner of each game. Players can play multiple rounds and keep track of wins if desired.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Starting with N = 15**

1. **Initial State**:
   - **N = 15**
   - Prime factors of **15** are **3** and **5**.
   
2. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **P = 5**.
   - Calculates \( N = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \).
   - **N** is now **3**.

3. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **N = 3**, which is a prime number.
   - Must divide by **3**: \( N = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \).
   - **N** is now **1**.
   - **Player 2 wins**.

#### **Example 2: Starting with N = 12**

1. **Initial State**:
   - **N = 12**
   - Prime factors of **12** are **2** and **3**.
   
2. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **P = 3**.
   - Calculates \( N = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \).
   - **N** is now **4**.

3. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Prime factor of **4** is **2**.
   - Chooses **P = 2**.
   - Calculates \( N = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).
   - **N** is now **2**.

4. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N = 2**, which is a prime number.
   - Must divide by **2**: \( N = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \).
   - **N** is now **1**.
   - **Player 1 wins**.

### **Sample Command-Line Interaction**

#### **Game Start**

```
Welcome to Factor Frenzy!
Enter the starting number N (greater than 1): 18
Randomly selecting the first player...
Player 1 will start the game.

Current N: 18
```

#### **Player 1's Turn**

```
Player 1's turn.
Prime factors of 18 are: 2, 3
Enter a prime factor to divide N: 3
You chose to divide by 3.
N is now: 6
```

#### **Player 2's Turn**

```
Player 2's turn.
Prime factors of 6 are: 2, 3
Enter a prime factor to divide N: 2
You chose to divide by 2.
N is now: 3
```

#### **Player 1's Turn**

```
Player 1's turn.
N is 3, which is a prime number.
Dividing N by 3.
N is now: 1
Player 1 wins the game!
```

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Try to anticipate your opponent's possible moves and set traps by leaving them with prime numbers on their turns.
- **Prime Awareness**: Keep a mental or written note of prime numbers and their factors to make quick decisions.
- **Force Primes**: Aim to reduce **N** to a prime number on your opponent's turn, forcing them to hand you the win.
