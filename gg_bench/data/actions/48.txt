The action space indices in the gym environment are mapped directly to potential divisors in the game. Each index represents a possible action a player can take, where the action corresponds to selecting a divisor from 2 up to the current number minus 1. An action is valid if it is a proper divisor of the current number; that is, the current number must divide evenly by the action. If the chosen action is not a proper divisor or falls outside the valid range, it results in an invalid move.
