In the given gym environment for Digit Drop Duel, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, representing the digits 0-9. Each index in this action space corresponds directly to a digit that a player can choose to remove from the current shared number. For example, if a player selects action `3`, it implies the player wants to remove the first occurrence of the digit `3` from the current shared number, if present. This mapping allows players to use any of the digits as potential actions, aligning with the game's rules where a player removes a digit on their turn.
