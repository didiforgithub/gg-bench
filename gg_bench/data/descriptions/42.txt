# Rule Book for "Token Jump"

## Objective

Be the first player to move your token from the starting position (0) to the end position (10) on a shared number line, following the game's movement rules. Strategic planning and careful movement are key to outmaneuvering your opponent and reaching the goal first.

## Setup

- **Number Line**: Create a number line with positions numbered from **0** to **10**.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player selects a unique token to represent themselves on the number line. For simplicity in a command-line interface:
  - **Player 1**: Represented by `A`
  - **Player 2**: Represented by `B`
- **Starting Positions**: Both player tokens are placed at position **0** on the number line.

## Game Components

- **Number Line (0-10)**: A linear path that players navigate by moving their tokens forward toward the end position.
- **Player Tokens**: Distinct markers (`A` and `B`) that indicate each player's current position on the number line.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by mutual agreement or a random method like flipping a coin).
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Movement Choice**: On your turn, choose to move your token forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
  2. **Movement Execution**: Advance your token according to your chosen movement, adhering to the movement rules.
  3. **Turn Completion**: After moving, the turn passes to the other player.
- **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until one player wins by reaching position **10**.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

1. **Allowed Movements**: On your turn, you may move your token forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
   - **Example**: If your token is at position **4**, you can move to position **5**, **6**, or **7**.
2. **Movement Restrictions**:
   - **No Backward Movement**: You cannot move your token backward.
   - **Exact Landing**: You must land exactly on position **10** to win; you cannot move beyond position **10**.
   - **Blockade Rule**:
     - **Cannot Pass or Land On Opponent**: You cannot move your token past or onto the position occupied by your opponent's token.
     - **Limited Movement**: If your opponent's token is directly ahead within your maximum movement range (1-3 positions), you can only move up to the space just before their token.
     - **Blocked Movement**: If your opponent's token is immediately ahead (adjacent), and you cannot move without violating the blockade rule, you must forfeit your movement for that turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to land exactly on position **10** wins the game.
- **No Possible Moves**:
  - **Stalemate Avoidance**: If you cannot move because all possible movements would violate the blockade rule or overshoot position **10**, you must pass your turn. The game continues until a player wins.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game is won by the first player to reach position **10**. There is no point-based scoring system.
- **No Draws**: The game does not allow for a draw; play continues until a player wins.
