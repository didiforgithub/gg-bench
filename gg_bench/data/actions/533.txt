The action space indices in the game map to the list of prime numbers that can be used as divisors. Each index corresponds to a specific prime factor of the current shared number `N` (up to the starting number 100). When a player selects an action (i.e., an index), it represents choosing a prime factor to divide `N`. This selection effectively maps the action to dividing `N` by the prime represented by the chosen index in the list of primes. The valid actions are those indices where the prime can exactly divide the current `N` without a remainder.
