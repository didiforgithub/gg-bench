In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for the game Number Merge, the action space consists of two discrete moves indexed as follows:

- **Action 0**: Double own number.
- **Action 1**: Add the opponent's number to own number.

These indices are used to map the player's chosen move during their turn, with the environment enforcing game rules such as numerical limits to ensure valid actions.
