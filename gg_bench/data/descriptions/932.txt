# Add or Multiply: A Strategic Numerical Duel

## Objective

Be the **first player** to reach **exactly 100** by sequentially manipulating a cumulative total starting from **1**. Players must carefully choose their operations to reach the target number without exceeding it.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Total:** The game begins with a cumulative total of **1**.
- **Players:** Two players take turns. Decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin).

---

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Total:** A shared number that both players manipulate during their turns. It starts at **1** and changes based on players' moves.
- **Allowed Operations:**
  - **Addition (+1):** Increase the cumulative total by **1**.
  - **Multiplication (×2):** Multiply the cumulative total by **2**.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Player Actions:** On your turn, you must perform **one** of the allowed operations on the cumulative total:
  - **Add 1**
  - **Multiply by 2**
- **Valid Moves:** The result of your operation must not exceed **100**.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Performing Operations:**
   - Choose **one** operation per turn.
   - Apply the operation to the cumulative total to get a new total.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Reach exactly 100:** If your operation brings the cumulative total to **exactly 100**, you **win** the game.

3. **Losing the Game:**
   - **Exceed 100:** If your operation causes the cumulative total to exceed **100**, you **lose** immediately.

4. **Continuation of Play:**
   - If neither player has won or lost, the game continues with the next player's turn.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning:** The player who reaches exactly **100** wins the game.
- **Losing:** The player who causes the total to exceed **100** loses the game.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw; there will always be a winner.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

Below is an example of how a game might unfold:

1. **Starting Total:** 1

2. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New total: 1 × 2 = **2**

3. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New total: 2 × 2 = **4**

4. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New total: 4 + 1 = **5**

5. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New total: 5 × 2 = **10**

6. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New total: 10 + 1 = **11**

7. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New total: 11 × 2 = **22**

8. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New total: 22 × 2 = **44**

9. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New total: 44 + 1 = **45**

10. **Player 1's Turn:**
    - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
    - New total: 45 × 2 = **90**

11. **Player 2's Turn:**
    - Chooses to **add 1**.
    - New total: 90 + 1 = **91**

12. **Player 1's Turn:**
    - Chooses to **add 1** (multiplying would exceed 100).
    - New total: 91 + 1 = **92**

13. **Players continue adding 1** on their turns.

14. **Final Moves:**
    - **Player 1's Turn:**
      - New total: 99 + 1 = **100**
      - **Player 1 wins!**

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Here's how the game might look in a command-line interface:

```
--- Game Start ---
Starting total is 1.

Player 1's turn.
Current total: 1
Choose your operation ('add' to add 1, 'multiply' to multiply by 2): multiply
You chose to multiply by 2.
New total is 2.

Player 2's turn.
Current total: 2
Choose your operation ('add' or 'multiply'): multiply
You chose to multiply by 2.
New total is 4.

Player 1's turn.
Current total: 4
Choose your operation ('add' or 'multiply'): add
You chose to add 1.
New total is 5.

[...game continues...]

Player 1's turn.
Current total: 99
Choose your operation ('add' or 'multiply'): add
You chose to add 1.
New total is 100.

Congratulations, Player 1! You reached exactly 100 and won the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Think several moves in advance to avoid setting up your opponent for a win.
- **Control the Pace:** Use multiplication to leap ahead when advantageous, but be cautious not to overshoot.
- **Force Your Opponent's Hand:** Try to put the cumulative total at a number where your opponent has no choice but to make a move that benefits you.
- **Avoid Overstepping:** Be cautious when the total is high; a wrong multiplication can cause you to exceed 100 and lose.

---

## Summary

"Add or Multiply" is a simple yet strategically rich game that's perfect for a command-line interface. With only two possible operations each turn, players must use foresight and planning to reach exactly 100 before their opponent. The game's simplicity makes it easy to code and quick to play, while the strategic depth ensures that skilled players can consistently outmaneuver less experienced opponents.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!

### Note to Players

- Ensure that all arithmetic operations are performed accurately.
- Keep track of the cumulative total after each turn.
- Remember that you cannot skip a turn; you must perform one of the allowed operations.
- Have fun and embrace the strategic battle of wits!
