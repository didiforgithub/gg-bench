In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 4, which correspond to player moves or selections ranging from 1 to 5. Specifically, an action index of 0 maps to selecting the number 1, an index of 1 maps to selecting the number 2, index 2 maps to selecting the number 3, index 3 maps to selecting the number 4, and index 4 maps to selecting the number 5. This mapping aligns the zero-based indexing in programming with the one-based selection range of the game.
