- **Player 2's Goal:** Reach position **15**.

## Setup

1. **Number Line:** A line of positions numbered from **0 to 15**.
2. **Marker:** Place a marker at the starting position **8** (the center of the number line).
3. **Player Roles:**
   - **Player 1:** Aims to move the marker to position **0** (left edge).
   - **Player 2:** Aims to move the marker to position **15** (right edge).
4. **Decide the First Player:** Players can flip a coin or agree on who goes first.

## Game Components

- **Number Line Positions (0-15):** Represents the path the marker will move along.
- **Marker:** A token or indicator showing the current position on the number line.
- **Players:** Two players taking alternate turns, each with a designated goal position.

## Turns

- **Alternate Play:** Players take turns moving the marker towards their goal position.
- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Current Position Announcement:** The game displays the current position of the marker.
  2. **Available Moves Display:** Based on the previous move, if applicable.
  3. **Player's Move Input:** The player enters their chosen move distance.
  4. **Movement Resolution:** The marker is moved, and the new position is announced.
  5. **Win Check:** The game checks if the marker has reached a goal position.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Movement Rules

- **Move Distance Options:** On your turn, you may move the marker **1**, **2**, or **3** positions towards your goal.
- **Direction of Movement:** You must move the marker towards your own goal position.
  - **Player 1:** Moves left toward **0**.
  - **Player 2:** Moves right toward **15**.
- **Goal Boundary:** You cannot move past your goal position. If the remaining distance to your goal is less than your chosen move, you must choose a smaller move.
  
### 2. Special Movement Restriction

- **Forbidden Move:** You cannot choose the same move distance (1, 2, or 3) as your opponent's **immediately preceding move**.
  - **Example:** If your opponent moved the marker **2** positions on their last turn, you cannot move it **2** positions on your turn.
- **First Turn Exception:** This rule does not apply on the very first turn of the game.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:** You win if you move the marker exactly to your goal position on your turn.
- **No Draws:** The game continues until one player reaches their goal; there are no ties or stalemates.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome:** The game is won by the first player to reach their goal. There is no point scoring system.

- **Plan Ahead:** Think several moves ahead to set up a path to victory while impeding your opponent.

## Sample Command-Line Interaction

Below is a sample of how the game might proceed in a command-line interface.

### Game Start

- **Marker Position:** 8
- **Player 1's Goal:** 0
- **Player 2's Goal:** 15
- **Player 1 goes first.**

### Turn-by-Turn Interaction

**Player 1's Turn:**

```
Current Marker Position: 8
Opponent's Last Move: N/A
Available Moves: 1, 2, 3
Enter your move distance (1, 2, or 3): 2
Marker moved to position 6 towards your goal.
```

**Player 2's Turn:**

```
Current Marker Position: 6
Opponent's Last Move: 2

## Additional Rules and Clarifications

- **Invalid Moves:**
  - If a player attempts to move using a forbidden move distance, they must choose a valid option.
  - If no valid moves are available (rare), the player loses their turn.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the marker is so close to the goal that the allowed moves overshoot, the player must choose a smaller move.
    - **Example:** If Player 1 is at position **1**, they can only move **1** position to reach **0**.
- **Fair Play:** Players should ensure they follow the move restriction rule diligently.

## Ensuring Strategic Depth and Complexity

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The move restriction based on the opponentâ€™s last move adds a layer of strategic planning.
- **Quick Resolution:** With a limited number of positions and move options, the game progresses swiftly.
- **Skill Over Chance:** Success relies on outmaneuvering the opponent rather than luck.
