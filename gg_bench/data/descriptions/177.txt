# Battle to Ten: Rule Book

## Objective

**Battle to Ten** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly 10** by adding available digits to your total without exceeding it. Exceeding a total of 10 results in an immediate loss. Skilled play involves strategic selection of digits to advance your total while preventing your opponent from reaching 10.

## Setup

1. **Starting Totals**: Both players begin with a total of **0**.
2. **Available Digits**: A shared pool of digits from **1** to **9** is available for both players.
3. **First Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Digits Pool**: Numbers from **1** to **9**.
- **Player Totals**: Each player keeps track of their current total (starting at 0).
- **Used Digits List**: A list to track which digits have been used and are no longer available.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with the first player.
- **Turn Actions**:
  - Choose one **unused digit** from the available digits pool.
  - **Add** the chosen digit to **your total**.
  - **Update** the available digits pool and used digits list by removing the chosen digit.
  - **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**.

- **Example Turn**:
  - **Available Digits**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  - **Player A's Total**: 0
  - **Player B's Total**: 0
  - **Player A** selects digit **3**.
  - **Player A's Total** becomes **3**.
  - Digit **3** is removed from available digits.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - Players can only select **unused digits** from **1** to **9**.
   - Each digit can be used **only once** in the game.

2. **Updating Totals**:
   - After selecting a digit, a player **adds** it to **their own total**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player **wins** if, after their turn, **their total is exactly 10**.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - A player **loses** immediately if **their total exceeds 10** after adding a digit.
   - If a player has **no legal moves** (no available digits can be added without exceeding 10), they **lose their turn**, and the opponent continues. If both players have no legal moves, the player with the **lower total** wins.

5. **No Draw Mechanism**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite number of digits and the win/loss conditions.

6. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players must be cautious not to set up the opponent for a win by leaving them with a winning digit.
   - Anticipate which digits remain and plan accordingly to avoid exceeding a total of 10.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winner is the first to reach a total of exactly 10.
- **Defeat**: Exceeding a total of 10 or being unable to make a legal move results in a loss.
- **No Points System**: The game outcome is determined by win or loss; there is no ongoing point scoring.

- **Block Opponent**: Avoid leaving a digit available that would allow your opponent to reach 10 on their next turn.
- **Safe Additions**: If you cannot reach 10 on your turn, consider selecting a digit that brings you closer without setting up your opponent.
