In the gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.starting_number + 1)`, which means it includes indices from 0 to `starting_number`. However, only indices from 2 to `current_number - 1` represent valid moves, as they correspond to valid divisors of the `current_number` in the game. The selection of an index as an action implies choosing that index as a divisor to divide the `current_number`, as long as the quotient is an integer and the action is within valid bounds (greater than 1 and less than `current_number`). Indices that don't satisfy these conditions are invalid actions.
