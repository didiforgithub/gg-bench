The action space in this game is represented by a `Discrete(20)` space, where each action index corresponds to a number in the list of numbers from 1 to 20. Specifically, the action index `n` (where `n` ranges from 0 to 19) maps to the number `n + 1`. This means that action index 0 corresponds to the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 19, which corresponds to the number 20. This mapping allows the players to select numbers directly via actions in the environment's action space.
