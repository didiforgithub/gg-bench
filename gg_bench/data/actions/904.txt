In the game "Isolation," the action space indices directly correspond to the positions of the numbers on the sequence from 1 to 11. The indices range from 0 to 10 in the code. Thus, an action taken with an index `i` (where `i` is between 0 and 10) represents the removal of the number `i+1` from the sequence. The action space of size 11 allows the player to select any one of the numbers (1 through 11) for removal if it is available.
