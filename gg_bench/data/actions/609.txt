In the given game environment, the action space consists of integers from 0 to 15, corresponding directly to the 16 cells in the 4x4 grid (numbered 1 to 16 in the game description). Each index in the action space represents a potential move to place or move a player's marker to the corresponding cell in the grid. Specifically, an action of `0` corresponds to cell `1`, an action of `1` corresponds to cell `2`, and so on, up to an action of `15`, which corresponds to cell `16`. This mapping ensures that each action directly targets a specific cell, enabling players to select their desired move or placement on the board.
