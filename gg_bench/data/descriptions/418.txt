**Game Name:** Reverse Addition

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Reverse Addition** is to strategically force your opponent's total score to reach or exceed a predetermined target number (commonly 25). Players take turns selecting numbers to add to their opponent's total score. The first player to cause their opponent's total to reach or exceed the target number wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Determine the Target Total:** Agree on a target total score that players will aim to force their opponent to reach or exceed. The standard target total is **25**, but players may choose any suitable positive integer.

2. **Initialize Player Totals:** Each player begins with a total score of **0**.

3. **Number Pool:** A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **10** is available. These numbers can be selected multiple times and are not removed from the pool after selection.

4. **Decide Turn Order:** Players decide who will take the first turn, either by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

### **Turns**

- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Selection Phase:** On your turn, select a number between **1** and **10** (inclusive) from the number pool.
  2. **Addition Phase:** Add the selected number to your opponent's total score.
  3. **Update Totals:** Announce the new total score of your opponent.
  4. **Check for Victory:** Determine if the opponent's total has reached or exceeded the target total.
  5. **Pass Turn:** If the game has not ended, pass the turn to your opponent.

- **Order of Play:**
  - Players alternate turns until the game ends.
  - Each turn consists of a single number selection and addition to the opponent's total.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection:**
   - On your turn, you **must** select a number between **1** and **10** (inclusive).
   - The number is selected from the shared number pool.
   - Numbers are **not** removed from the pool after selection and can be chosen multiple times by either player.

2. **Adding to Opponent's Total:**
   - The selected number is **added** to your opponent's total score immediately.
   - You cannot add to your own total; you must add to your opponent's total.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Victory Condition:** If, after adding the selected number, your opponent's total score **reaches or exceeds** the target total, you win the game.
   - The game ends immediately upon reaching the victory condition.

4. **Game Continuation:**
   - If your opponent's total score is **below** the target total after your turn, the game continues.
   - Turns alternate until one player wins.

5. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players cannot skip their turn or pass without selecting a number.

6. **Valid Moves:**
   - All selections between **1** and **10** are valid, regardless of the opponent's current total.

7. **Tie Scenario:**
   - Since only one player's total is increased per turn, and victory is achieved by causing the opponent's total to reach or exceed the target, there are no tie scenarios in this game.

### **Scoring**

- **Tracking Totals:**
  - Both players' total scores should be tracked and visible throughout the game.
  - Totals are updated immediately after each turn.

- **Victory Verification:**
  - Continuously check after each turn if the opponent's total has reached or exceeded the target total.

- **Example of Score Tracking:**

  | Turn | Player Action                | Opponent's New Total | Opponent's Total After Turn |
  |------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
  | 1    | Player 1 adds **7** to Player 2 | 0 + 7 = **7**         | Player 2: **7**             |
  | 2    | Player 2 adds **9** to Player 1 | 0 + 9 = **9**         | Player 1: **9**             |
  | ...  |                              |                      |                             |

### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate the impact of your number selection on future turns. Avoid giving your opponent totals that enable them to control the game's pace.

- **Control the Endgame:** As the opponent's total approaches the target, select numbers that limit their options and force them into a losing position.

- **Mirror Strategy:** Mimic your opponent's moves when advantageous to maintain balance and potentially force them into a trap.

- **Counting Moves:** Keep track of the cumulative totals and calculate how different selections will influence the next few turns.

- **Avoid Giving Control:** Be cautious when the opponent's total is just below a multiple of the numbers available, as certain selections may allow them to win on their next turn.

### **Notes**

- **Simplicity in Coding:** The game is designed to be easily implemented in a command-line interface. It requires basic input/output functions and simple arithmetic operations.
  
- **No Draw Mechanism:** The game rules ensure that there is always a winner. Since only one player's total increases per turn and victory is achieved by forcing the opponent's total to reach or exceed the target, draws are not possible.

- **Strategic Depth:** Although rules are simple, the game allows for strategic planning and anticipation of the opponent's moves. Skilled players can consistently outperform unskilled players by employing effective strategies.

- **Unique Mechanics:** The game introduces a reverse approach to addition games by having players add numbers to their opponent's total instead of their own, which adds a unique twist and ensures it's not similar to traditional games like Nim or Tic-Tac-Toe.

Enjoy playing **Reverse Addition**, and may the most strategic player win!
