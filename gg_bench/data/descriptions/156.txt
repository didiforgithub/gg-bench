**Sequence Duel**

---

### **Objective**

Sequence Duel is a two-player, turn-based game where players construct a shared sequence of numbers. The primary goal is to avoid creating a sequence that contains any three consecutive numbers forming an increasing, decreasing, or constant pattern. The player who cannot make a legal move on their turn loses the game. Victory is achieved by skillfully selecting numbers to extend the sequence while forcing your opponent into an impossible move.

---

### **Setup**

- **Starting Condition**: The game begins with an empty sequence.
- **Players**: Two players are designated as Player 1 and Player 2. Determine who goes first by agreement or a random method such as a coin toss.
- **Number Pool**: Both players have access to numbers from **1** to **9**. Numbers can be used multiple times.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Sequence**: A list that both players contribute to, extended one number at a time.
- **Number Options**: Integers from **1** to **9**. These numbers serve as the building blocks for the sequence.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Player Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must:
    1. **Select a Number**: Choose any number between **1** and **9** (inclusive).
    2. **Extend the Sequence**: Add the selected number to the **end** of the shared sequence.
- **Turn Progression**: After a player adds a number to the sequence, the turn passes to the other player.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Legal Moves**:
   - A player **must not** add a number that results in the last **three** numbers of the sequence forming any of the following patterns:
     - **Increasing Sequence**: Each subsequent number is higher than the previous (e.g., 2, 3, 4).
     - **Decreasing Sequence**: Each subsequent number is lower than the previous (e.g., 5, 4, 3).
     - **Constant Sequence**: All three numbers are the same (e.g., 7, 7, 7).
   - The sequence is examined **only** for the **last three numbers** after each move.
2. **Illegal Moves**:
   - If a player cannot add any number without creating one of the prohibited patterns, they have no legal moves.
   - Making an illegal move is not permitted; the player must concede if no legal moves are available.
3. **Ending the Game**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.
   - The player who **made the last legal move** wins the game.
4. **Strategy**:
   - Players should aim to extend the sequence in a way that limits the opponent's options on their subsequent turn.
   - Anticipate possible sequences and plan moves to avoid setting up losing positions.

### **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**: The player who forces their opponent into a position with no legal moves wins.
- **No Points System**: Sequence Duel is based on winning or losing individual games rather than accumulating points.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play a series of games.
  - Keep track of wins to determine an overall champion after a set number of games.

### **Examples**

Below are sample turns illustrating how the rules are applied in practice, including command-line interactions.

#### **Example Game**

**Starting Sequence**: []

---

**Turn 1**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 5
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5]
  - **Reasoning**: No risk of forming a pattern since less than three numbers.

---

**Turn 2**

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 6
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6]
  - **Reasoning**: Still less than three numbers; no patterns formed.

---

**Turn 3**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 7
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 7]
  - **Outcome**: Illegal move.
  - **Explanation**: The last three numbers form an increasing sequence (5, 6, 7).
  - **Action**: Player 1 must choose a different number.

- **Alternate Number Selection**:
  - **Selects Number**: 5
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5]
  - **Reasoning**: The last three numbers are (6, 5, 5), which do not form a prohibited pattern.

---

**Turn 4**

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 4
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4]
  - **Reasoning**: Last three numbers are (5, 5, 4); not a prohibited pattern.

---

**Turn 5**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 3
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 3]
  - **Outcome**: Illegal move.
  - **Explanation**: The last three numbers are (5, 4, 3), forming a decreasing sequence.
  - **Alternate Number Selection**:
    - **Selects Number**: 6
    - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 6]
    - **Reasoning**: Last three numbers are (4, 6, 6); no prohibited pattern.

---

**Turn 6**

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 6
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 6]
  - **Outcome**: Illegal move.
  - **Explanation**: The last three numbers are (6, 6, 6), forming a constant sequence.
  - **Alternate Number Selection**:
    - **Selects Number**: 7
    - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 7]
    - **Reasoning**: Last three numbers are (4, 6, 7); not a prohibited pattern.

---

**Turn 7**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Selects Number**: 8
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8]
  - **Outcome**: Illegal move.
  - **Explanation**: The last three numbers are (6, 7, 8), forming an increasing sequence.
  - **Alternate Number Selection**:
    - **Selects Number**: 5
    - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5]
    - **Reasoning**: Last three numbers are (7, 5, 5); no prohibited pattern.

---

**Turn 8**

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Possible Numbers to Choose**: Review each number from 1 to 9 to see if any can be legally played.
  - **Analysis**:
    - Selecting 4: Last three numbers would be (5, 5, 4) - not prohibited.
    - Selecting 6: Last three numbers would be (5, 5, 6) - not prohibited.
    - Selecting 5: Last three numbers would be (5, 5, 5) - forms a constant sequence (Illegal).
    - Continue checking other numbers.
  - **Selects Number**: 4
  - **Sequence Becomes**: [5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5, 4]
  - **Reasoning**: Last three numbers are (5, 5, 4); legal move.

---

**Turn 9**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Repeat the process of checking available numbers.**
  - **Potential Moves**:
    - Must avoid creating prohibited patterns.
  - **Selects Number**: After analysis, if no legal numbers can be added without forming a prohibited pattern, Player 1 has no legal moves.

- **Outcome**:
  - **Player 1 has no legal moves and loses the game.**
  - **Winner**: Player 2.

**Command-Line Interaction Example**

```
Game Start: The sequence is empty.

Player 1's Turn:
Enter a number between 1 and 9: 5
Sequence: [5]

Player 2's Turn:
Enter a number between 1 and 9: 6
Sequence: [5, 6]

Player 1's Turn:
Enter a number between 1 and 9: 7
Invalid move - forms an increasing sequence.
Enter a different number: 5
Sequence: [5, 6, 5]
...
(Player turns continue as in the example above)
...
Player 1's Turn:
No legal moves available.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

### **Tips for Players**

- **Plan Ahead**: Always consider how your chosen number affects the sequence and what options it leaves for your opponent.
- **Avoid Obvious Patterns**: Be cautious not to set up a sequence where your opponent can force you into a losing position.
- **Monitor Last Three Numbers**: Focus on the last two numbers in the sequence to predict which numbers are safe to play.
- **Force the Opponent's Hand**: Try to limit the options available to your opponent, increasing the chance that they will have no legal moves.
