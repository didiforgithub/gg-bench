In the given gym environment for the Equation Duel game, the action space indices correspond to the possible valid equations a player can make. Each index in the action space represents a unique equation that can be formed using numbers from the pool. The `generate_equations` method computes all feasible equations using the numbers 1 to 9 with the operators +, -, *, and /, ensuring results are integers within the same range. Each resulting equation is associated with an action space index. An action taken in the environment corresponds to selecting one of these indexes, thereby executing the specific equation they represent.
