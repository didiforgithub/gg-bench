In the gym environment, the action space indices correspond to possible moves as follows:
- **Index 1**: Represents the action to subtract 1 from the current number, only applicable if the number is prime.
- **Indices 2 to N_start**: Each index represents an attempt to divide the current number by its respective integer value. These actions are valid only if the number is composite and the integer is a proper divisor of the current number.
