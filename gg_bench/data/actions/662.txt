In the game "Prime Path," the action space indices correspond directly to the indices of the list of prime numbers generated for positions less than N. During gameplay, each index in the action space represents a specific prime number that a player can choose to subtract from their current position. Selecting an action index translates into choosing the prime number at that index in the list of available prime numbers, determining the player's next move on the numerical path. This mapping allows players to decide their moves based on the primes corresponding to the given action indices.
