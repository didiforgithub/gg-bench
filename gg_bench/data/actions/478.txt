The action space in the game is represented by integers 0 to 24, corresponding to the 25 positions on the 5x5 grid. Each action space index directly maps to a coordinate on the grid, with index `n` corresponding to position `(n % 5, n // 5)`. For example, action 0 corresponds to the position (0, 0), action 1 to (1, 0), up to action 24 for (4, 4). This mapping allows players to specify their moves by selecting an index that represents their desired target position on the grid.
