# Divide and Conquer

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the **shared number** to exactly **1** by strategically dividing it by its prime factors. The game is a test of strategy and understanding of prime numbers.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: Choose a positive integer greater than 1 with at least two prime factors (e.g., 48). This will be the **shared number**.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., flip a coin).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer that both players will manipulate during the game.
- **Prime Factors**: Prime numbers that are factors of the current shared number.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played using text input and output in a command-line environment.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Display Current Shared Number**: At the start of each turn, the current shared number is displayed.
2. **Determine Prime Factors**: List the prime factors of the shared number.
3. **Player's Action**: The current player chooses one of the prime factors to divide the shared number by.
4. **Update Shared Number**: The shared number is updated to the quotient of the division.
5. **Display Result**: Show the result of the division and the new shared number.

### Player Actions

- **Valid Actions**: On their turn, a player must:
  - Choose a prime factor of the shared number that is greater than 1.
  - Divide the shared number by this prime factor.
- **Invalid Actions**:
  - Choosing a number that is not a prime factor of the shared number.
  - Passing their turn or refusing to make a move.
  - Dividing by 1 or any number less than 1.

### Progression of Turns

- Players alternate turns until one player wins the game.
- The game continues even if the shared number becomes a prime number.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Dividing the Shared Number**:
   - Players must divide the shared number by one of its prime factors greater than 1.
   - The division must result in an integer quotient (no remainders).
2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces the shared number to exactly **1** on their turn **wins the game**.
3. **Forced Moves**:
   - If only one valid prime factor exists, the player must divide by that prime factor.
4. **Invalid Inputs**:
   - Players must input valid prime factors. Invalid inputs require the player to try again.
5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn or pass; they must make a valid move if possible.

### Special Cases

- **Shared Number is Prime**:
  - If the shared number is prime, the only valid move is to divide it by itself, resulting in **1**, and the player wins.
- **No Valid Moves**:
  - If a player cannot make a valid move (which should not happen if rules are followed), they lose the game by default.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The first player to reduce the shared number to exactly **1** wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no points system; the game is won by achieving the objective.

## Examples

### Example Game 1: Starting Number 48

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Shared Number**: 48
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3
- **Player 1 Chooses**: Divide by 2
- **Calculation**: 48 ÷ 2 = 24
- **New Shared Number**: 24

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Shared Number**: 24
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3
- **Player 2 Chooses**: Divide by 3
- **Calculation**: 24 ÷ 3 = 8
- **New Shared Number**: 8

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Shared Number**: 8
- **Prime Factors**: 2
- **Player 1 Chooses**: Divide by 2
- **Calculation**: 8 ÷ 2 = 4
- **New Shared Number**: 4

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Shared Number**: 4
- **Prime Factors**: 2
- **Player 2 Chooses**: Divide by 2
- **Calculation**: 4 ÷ 2 = 2
- **New Shared Number**: 2

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Shared Number**: 2
- **Prime Factors**: 2
- **Player 1 Chooses**: Divide by 2
- **Calculation**: 2 ÷ 2 = 1
- **New Shared Number**: 1

**Player 1 Wins!**

### Example Game 2: Starting Number 30

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Shared Number**: 30
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3, 5
- **Player 1 Chooses**: Divide by 5
- **Calculation**: 30 ÷ 5 = 6
- **New Shared Number**: 6

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Shared Number**: 6
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3
- **Player 2 Chooses**: Divide by 3
- **Calculation**: 6 ÷ 3 = 2
- **New Shared Number**: 2

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Shared Number**: 2
- **Prime Factors**: 2
- **Player 1 Chooses**: Divide by 2
- **Calculation**: 2 ÷ 2 = 1
- **New Shared Number**: 1

**Player 1 Wins!**

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

### Starting the Game

```
Welcome to Divide and Conquer!
Starting number is 48.
Player 1 will go first.
```

### Sample Turn

```
--------------------------------
Player 1's Turn
Current shared number: 48
Prime factors: 2, 3
Enter a prime factor to divide by: 2
48 divided by 2 is 24.
New shared number is 24.
```

### Invalid Input Handling

```
--------------------------------
Player 2's Turn
Current shared number: 24
Prime factors: 2, 3
Enter a prime factor to divide by: 4
Invalid input. 4 is not a prime factor of 24.
Please enter a valid prime factor: 3
24 divided by 3 is 8.
New shared number is 8.
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your strategy several turns in advance.
- **Control the Game**: Try to leave the shared number in a state where your opponent has fewer prime factors to choose from.
- **Prime Awareness**: Familiarity with prime numbers and factorization enhances decision-making.
- **Force the Win**: When possible, reduce the shared number to a prime number on your turn, forcing your opponent into a position where you can win on your next turn.

## Additional Rules

- **Fair Play**: Players should not use calculators or external tools that give them an unfair advantage.
- **Time Limit** (Optional): To keep the game moving quickly, impose a time limit per turn (e.g., 30 seconds).
- **Rematches**: Players can agree to play multiple rounds, possibly with varying starting numbers, to determine an overall winner.

## Summary

"Divide and Conquer" is a quick, engaging game that combines arithmetic practice with strategic planning. The simplicity of its rules makes it easy to learn and play in a command-line interface, while the depth of strategy ensures that skilled players can consistently triumph over less experienced opponents. Enjoy testing your wits in this battle of numbers!
