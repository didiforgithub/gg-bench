In the game environment, actions are represented by indices from 0 to 9:

- **Action 0:** Corresponds to passing the turn. The player chooses not to select any number as a petal.
  
- **Actions 1 to 9:** Correspond to selecting numbers 1 to 9 from the number pool. These numbers can be chosen either as the central number during the central selection phase or as a petal during the petal selection phase, depending on the current stage of the game. Selecting an appropriate number depends on the game's rules: availability in the pool, GCD conditions for petals, and phase-specific requirements.
