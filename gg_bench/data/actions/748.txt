In the GridLock game environment, the action space indices (ranging from 0 to 24) correspond to the cells of the 5x5 grid, arranged in row-major order. Each index can be mapped to a specific cell on the grid based on its row and column as follows:

- The index `action` maps to the grid cell at coordinate `(row, column)`, where:
  - `row = action // 5`
  - `column = action % 5`

This mapping uniquely identifies each cell on the grid, facilitating the placement of a player's symbol at the specified coordinates during their turn.
