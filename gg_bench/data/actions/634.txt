In the game environment, the action space indices correspond to the indices of prime numbers in the `primes_list`, which contains all primes up to a specified maximum value (`max_N`). Each action represents the selection of a prime number from this list to divide the current shared number `N`. When a player takes an action with a specific index, the corresponding prime number in `primes_list` is used to attempt to divide `N`. The validity of the move is determined by checking if the chosen prime is a factor of `N`. Valid moves result in updating `N` by dividing it by the selected prime, while invalid actions incur a penalty.
