In the gym environment for Factor Duel, each possible action in the action space represents selecting a number from the pool, corresponding to an index from 0 to 48. These indices map directly to integers 2 through 50. Specifically, an action with index `i` selects the number `i + 2`, because numbering starts from 2, not 0. This way, choosing action 0 corresponds to number 2, action 1 to number 3, and so on, up to action 48 which corresponds to number 50.
