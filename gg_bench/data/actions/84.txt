In the game Binary Battle, the action space is represented by the indices 0 to 7, corresponding directly to bit positions in the opponent's 8-bit binary number. During a player's turn, selecting an action index implies flipping the bit at the chosen index from 1 to 0 in the opponent's binary number, provided the bit is currently set to 1. This mapping ensures that each action directly affects the binary representation, allowing players to alter their opponent's number strategically.
