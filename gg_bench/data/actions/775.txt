The action space in the gym environment is defined as a discrete space of size 60, representing integers from 0 to 59. Each action index corresponds to a potential divisor by mapping the index to a divisor through the formula: divisor = action + 1. This maps index 0 to divisor 1, index 1 to divisor 2, and so on up to index 59 representing divisor 60. However, valid moves in the game are only those indices corresponding to proper divisors (greater than 1 and less than the current number) that evenly divide the current number.
