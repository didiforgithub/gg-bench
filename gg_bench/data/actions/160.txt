The action space indices (0 to 8) map directly to the positions in the 3x3 grid, where each index represents a grid cell in row-major order. Index 0 corresponds to the top-left cell (position [1][1]), index 1 to the top-middle cell (position [1][2]), and so forth, ending with index 8, which corresponds to the bottom-right cell (position [3][3]). Players choose a number by selecting its corresponding index in the action space.
