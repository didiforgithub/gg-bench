In the game, the action space is represented by a `Discrete(5)` space, where each index corresponds to a specific power that a player can use. The mapping is as follows:

- Action index `0` corresponds to the power `1` *(2⁰)*.
- Action index `1` corresponds to the power `2` *(2¹)*.
- Action index `2` corresponds to the power `4` *(2²)*.
- Action index `3` corresponds to the power `8` *(2³)*.
- Action index `4` corresponds to the power `16` *(2⁴)*.
