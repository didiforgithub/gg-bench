In the environment, the actions are represented by a discrete space with indices mapped to characters as follows: action `0` corresponds to choosing character `'A'`, action `1` corresponds to character `'B'`, and action `2` corresponds to character `'C'`. These actions dictate which character will be appended to the current string during a player's turn.
