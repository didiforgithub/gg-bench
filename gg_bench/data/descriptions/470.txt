### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Bid Anticipation:**
  - Try to predict the opponent's bid based on previous choices.
  - Consider what bid they might choose in response to the current score.

- **Risk Management:**
  - High bids are powerful but risky if they cause the sum to exceed 7.
  - Low bids can be advantageous when expecting the opponent to bid high.

- **Bluffing:**
  - Varying your bidding strategy can confuse and unsettle your opponent.
  - Use unexpected bids to throw off their predictions.

- **Early Rounds:**
  - Use early rounds to gauge your opponent's strategy.
  - Consider starting with moderate bids to stay flexible.

- **When Behind:**

  - Bidding extremes (very high or very low) can help swing the outcome.

- **When Ahead:**
  - Play conservatively to maintain your lead.
  - Focus on bids that are less likely to result in a loss due to sum overflow.

---

### **Game Variations**

- **Adjustable Maximum Sum:**
  - Change the maximum sum limit to increase or decrease the game's complexity.
  - Example: Set the maximum sum to **9** instead of **7**.

- **Limited Use of Numbers:**
