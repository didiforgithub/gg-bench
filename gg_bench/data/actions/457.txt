In the provided gym environment for the Tower Switch game, actions are represented as indices in a discrete action space:

- **Action index 0**: Corresponds to removing 1 block from the tower.
- **Action index 1**: Corresponds to removing 2 blocks from the tower.

This mapping is established by adding 1 to the action index, meaning the number of blocks to remove is `action + 1`.
