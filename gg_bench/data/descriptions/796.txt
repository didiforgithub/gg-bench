# Sum Challenge: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

Be the first player to reach a total sum of **exactly 31** by strategically adding numbers to your total while anticipating and blocking your opponent's moves. Careful planning and foresight are key, as overshooting the target sum will result in an immediate loss.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Starting Total**: Both players begin with a total sum of **0**.

No physical setup is required. The game can be played using a command-line interface where each player inputs their chosen numbers when prompted.

## Game Components

- **Total Sum Tracker**: Keeps track of each player's current total sum.
- **Number Choices**: Integers from **1** to **6** (inclusive). These numbers represent the possible choices a player can add to their total sum on each turn.

The game components are digital and will be managed within the command-line interface, displaying current totals and validating moves according to the rules.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.
- **Player Actions**:
  - **Choose a Number**: On your turn, select a number between **1** and **6** (inclusive) to add to your total sum.
  - **Restrictions**: You **cannot** choose the same number that your opponent selected on their previous turn.
- **Turn Progression**:
  1. **Input Selection**: The current player inputs their chosen number.
  2. **Validation**: The game checks for compliance with the rules (valid number range and not repeating the opponent's last choice).
  3. **Update Total**: The chosen number is added to the player's total sum.
  4. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**: The game assesses if the current move results in a win, loss, or continuation.
  5. **Display Totals**: Updated totals are displayed to both players.
  6. **Next Player's Turn**: The turn switches to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, you must choose an integer between **1** and **6**.
   - You cannot select the same number your opponent chose on their immediately preceding turn.

2. **Updating Total Sum**:
   - The number you select is added to your personal total sum.
   - The game keeps separate totals for each player.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a total sum of **exactly 31** wins the game.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - **Overstepping**: If adding your chosen number causes your total sum to exceed **31**, you immediately lose the game.
   - **Invalid Move**: Selecting an invalid number (outside 1-6 or repeating the opponent's last number) prompts a retry, but repeated invalid attempts may result in a loss (optional rule for timed or competitive play).

### Strategic Mechanics

- **Number Memory**: Keep track of the numbers your opponent selects to avoid illegal moves.
- **Blocking**: Choose numbers that force your opponent into a difficult position or limit their options.
- **Planning Ahead**: Anticipate future sums to avoid overstepping the target of 31.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Successfully reaching a total sum of exactly **31**.
- **Defeat**:
  - Exceeding a total sum of **31**.
  - Being unable to make a legal move on your turn due to the opponent restricting your options (if all allowable numbers would cause you to exceed 31).

No ongoing score is tracked beyond the current game, but players may choose to play multiple rounds and keep track of wins for extended play.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Starting the Game

- **Player 1** begins the game.

#### Turn 1

- **Player 1**:
  - Chooses **4**.
  - Total sum: **0 + 4 = 4**.
- **Player 2** cannot choose **4** on this turn.

#### Turn 2

- **Player 2**:
  - Chooses **6**.
  - Total sum: **0 + 6 = 6**.
- **Player 1** cannot choose **6** on this turn.

#### Turn 3

- **Player 1**:
  - Chooses **5**.
  - Total sum: **4 + 5 = 9**.
- **Player 2** cannot choose **5** on this turn.

#### Turn 4

- **Player 2**:
  - Chooses **3**.
  - Total sum: **6 + 3 = 9**.
- **Player 1** cannot choose **3** on this turn.

#### Turn 5

- **Player 1**:
  - Chooses **2**.
  - Total sum: **9 + 2 = 11**.
- **Player 2** cannot choose **2** on this turn.

#### Turn 6

- **Player 2**:
  - Chooses **6**.
  - **Invalid Move**: Cannot choose **6** because it was not the last number chosen by Player 1.
  - **Corrected Move**: Chooses **4**.
  - Total sum: **9 + 4 = 13**.
- **Player 1** cannot choose **4** on this turn.

#### Turn 7

- **Player 1**:
  - Chooses **6**.
  - Total sum: **11 + 6 = 17**.
- **Player 2** cannot choose **6** on this turn.

#### Subsequent Turns

- Players continue in this manner, carefully choosing numbers to increment their totals towards **31**, while trying to prevent the opponent from selecting advantageous numbers.

### Winning Scenario

Assuming continued play:

#### Final Turns

- **Player 1** has a total sum of **26**.
- **Player 2's** last chosen number was **5**.
  
**Player 1's Turn**:

- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (cannot choose 5).
- **Choices**:
  - Choosing **5** is illegal (opponent's last choice).
  - **1**: Total sum would be **26 + 1 = 27**.
  - **2**: Total sum would be **28**.
  - **3**: Total sum would be **29**.
  - **4**: Total sum would be **30**.
  - **6**: Total sum would be **32** (exceeds 31, results in a loss).
- **Optimal Choice**: Selecting **4**, total sum becomes **30**.

**Player 2's Turn**:

- Cannot choose **4** (Player 1's last choice).
- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.
- **Choices**:
  - **1**: Total sum **26 + 1 = 27**
  - **2**: Total sum **26 + 2 = 28**
  - **3**: Total sum **26 + 3 = 29**
  - **5**: Total sum **26 + 5 = 31** **(Player 2 wins!)**
  
**Outcome**:

- **Player 2** selects **5**, reaching a total sum of **31**, and wins the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Welcome to Sum Challenge!

Player 1, it's your turn.
Your total sum: 0
Enter a number between 1 and 6 (cannot be the same as opponent's last pick): 4

Player 1 chose 4.
Player 1's total sum is now 4.

Player 2, it's your turn.
Your total sum: 0
(Note: You cannot choose 4.)
Enter a number between 1 and 6: 6

Player 2 chose 6.
Player 2's total sum is now 6.

Player 1, it's your turn.
Your total sum: 4
(Note: You cannot choose 6.)
Enter a number between 1 and 6: 5
...

[Gameplay continues as per the example above.]

...

Player 2, it's your turn.
Your total sum: 26
(Note: You cannot choose 4.)
Enter a number between 1 and 6: 5

Player 2 chose 5.
Player 2's total sum is now 31.

Congratulations, Player 2! You have reached exactly 31 and won the game!

## Additional Notes

- **Invalid Inputs**: If a player inputs an invalid number (outside 1-6 or the opponent's last number), prompt them to enter a valid number.
- **Repeated Invalid Attempts**: To maintain game flow, you may limit the number of invalid attempts per turn (e.g., after 3 invalid attempts, the player loses their turn).
- **Strategy Tips**:
  - **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Keep track of which numbers may lead your opponent to win or lose.
  - **Control Key Numbers**: Avoid choosing numbers that set up your opponent for an easy win.
  - **Calculate Ahead**: Plan your moves several turns in advance to navigate towards 31 without overshooting.
