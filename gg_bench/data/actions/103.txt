The action space indices map to the game's moves by representing the proper divisors of the current number. Each action index corresponds to a divisor \( D \) such that \( D = \text{action index} + 2 \). This mapping is used since the proper divisors are always greater than 1. For example, action index 0 corresponds to the divisor 2, action index 1 corresponds to the divisor 3, and so on. These indices allow the environment to handle actions as simple zero-based indices while still accurately reflecting the game's rules.
