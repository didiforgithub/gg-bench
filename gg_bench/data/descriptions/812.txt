# **Shadow Grid Duel**

Welcome to **Shadow Grid Duel**, a fast-paced, two-player strategy game designed for quick matches and strategic depth. This game is perfect for a command-line interface and is simple to code. It ensures that a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled one. Below is the comprehensive rule book to get you started.

## **Objective**

The primary goal of **Shadow Grid Duel** is to be the first player to align a trio of your numbers (either in a row, column, or diagonal) where the cumulative sum equals a secret target number known only to both players at the start of the game. Victory is achieved by strategically placing numbers on a shared grid to create this sum, while simultaneously blocking your opponent from achieving their goal.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Grid Initialization**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, initially empty.
2. **Secret Target Number**: At the start of the game, both players agree upon a secret target number between 10 and 20 (inclusive). This number remains constant throughout the game.
3. **Number Pool**: Each player has their own set of numbers from 1 to 9, inclusive. These numbers are used to place on the grid during the game.
4. **Starting Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by agreement or random selection).

## **Game Components**

- **Grid**: A 3x3 matrix representing the game board. Positions are identified by coordinates (row and column numbers).

- **Player Numbers**: Each player has numbers 1 through 9, which they can place on the grid. Once a number is used, it cannot be used again by the same player.

- **Secret Target Number**: A number between 10 and 20 that players aim to achieve by summing three of their numbers in alignment on the grid.

---

## **Turns**

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Number Selection**: The current player chooses a number from their available numbers (1-9).
  2. **Placement**: The player selects an empty cell on the grid to place their chosen number.
  3. **Turn Completion**: The turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Placement**:
   - Players can only place numbers in empty cells.
   - Each player can use each number from 1 to 9 only once.

2. **Alignment and Summation**:
   - After placing a number, players should check all possible alignments (rows, columns, diagonals) for a trio of their numbers.
   - If any alignment of three numbers sums up to the secret target number, the player wins immediately.

3. **Blocking**:
   - Players can place numbers to prevent their opponent from achieving the target sum in an alignment.

4. **No Draws**:
   - Since the grid has a finite number of cells and numbers, and the target sum is strategically chosen, the game cannot end in a draw.

5. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player achieves the target sum with three of their numbers in alignment.
   - If all cells are filled without either player achieving the target sum, the player who made the last move loses, emphasizing strategic foresight.

---

## **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**: Achieving an alignment (row, column, or diagonal) where the sum of the player's three numbers equals the secret target number.

- **Tracking**: No points are tracked beyond the immediate goal. The focus is on winning individual matches.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game Play**

**Secret Target Number**: 15

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Available Numbers**: 1-9
- **Action**: Chooses number **5**, places it at position (1,1).

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Available Numbers**: 1-9
- **Action**: Chooses number **7**, places it at position (1,2).

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Available Numbers**: 1-9 excluding **5**
- **Action**: Chooses number **6**, places it at position (2,2).

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Available Numbers**: 1-9 excluding **7**
- **Action**: Chooses number **8**, places it at position (1,3).

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Available Numbers**: 1-9 excluding **5**, **6**
- **Action**: Chooses number **4**, places it at position (3,3).

**Check for Victory**:
- Player 1 has numbers **5** at (1,1), **6** at (2,2), **4** at (3,3).
- These positions form a diagonal.
- Sum = **5 + 6 + 4 = 15**, which equals the secret target number.

**Result**: **Player 1 wins**.

### **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Number Selection**: Choose numbers that not only help you reach the target sum but also prevent your opponent from doing the same.

- **Blocking**: Always be aware of your opponent's placements and the numbers they've used. Place numbers that can block potential alignments.

- **Planning Ahead**: Think several moves ahead to set up your winning alignment.

- **Secret Target Number Choice**: Selecting a challenging secret target number adds depth to the game. Consider numbers that require more strategic planning to achieve.
