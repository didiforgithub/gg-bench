The action space comprises six discrete actions mapped to specific swaps. Actions 0 to 2 are for swapping within the current player's code: action 0 swaps positions 1 and 2, action 1 swaps positions 1 and 3, and action 2 swaps positions 2 and 3. Actions 3 to 5 are for swapping with the opponent's code at corresponding positions: action 3 swaps position 1, action 4 swaps position 2, and action 5 swaps position 3.
