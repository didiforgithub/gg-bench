# Conquest Command

Conquest Command is a unique, strategic two-player turn-based game designed for play in a command-line interface. Players engage in a tactical battle of wits, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent through clever resource management and strategic planning. The game is easy to code and ensures a swift conclusion with no possibility of a draw. A skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled player, adding depth and competitive excitement to each match.

## Objective

Be the first player to conquer the central territory by accumulating exactly **100 Power Points (PP)** through strategic resource allocation and territorial control. Achieving 100 PP allows a player to launch a decisive strike to claim victory. Exceeding 100 PP results in an overload and loss, so precise management is crucial.
