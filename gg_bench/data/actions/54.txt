In the provided gym environment for the Fibonacci Challenge, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.N)`, where each index represents a potential sum of two adjacent numbers in the current Fibonacci sequence. During each player's turn, an action (index) corresponds to selecting an available valid move from these potential sums that do not exceed the target number \( N \). The action chosen must align with the constraints of the game, such as not repeating the opponent's last move or adding the same number already at the sequence's end.
