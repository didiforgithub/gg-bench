# Number Mines: Rule Book

## Objective

Be the first player to safely navigate from the starting point to the goal without stepping on a hidden mine. Alternatively, outsmart your opponent by strategically placing mines that they cannot avoid, causing them to trigger a mine during their turn. The game ends when a player reaches the goal safely or when a player steps on a mine, resulting in their loss.

## Setup

1. **Game Board Creation:**
   - The game is played on a linear number line ranging from **1** to **20**.
   - Both players start at **position 1** on the number line.

2. **Mine Placement:**
   - Each player secretly selects **three** unique positions between **2** and **19** to place their mines.
   - Mines are hidden from the opponent and are only revealed if stepped on.
   - Players record their mine positions privately.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Line:**
  - A sequential list of numbers from **1** to **20** representing the game board.
  - Can be represented in the command-line interface as a simple list or array.

- **Player Tokens:**
  - Each player is represented by a token (e.g., `A` for Player A and `B` for Player B).
  - Tokens indicate the players' current positions on the number line.

- **Mines:**
  - Hidden traps placed on specific positions of the number line.
  - Represented internally in the game logic but not displayed to the opponent.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
   - Turns alternate between Player A and Player B.

2. **Player Actions:**
   - On their turn, a player must move their token forward along the number line.
   - Movement options are to advance **1**, **2**, or **3** positions forward.

3. **Turn Structure:**
   - **Input Phase:** The player chooses their movement distance.
   - **Movement Phase:** The player's token is moved accordingly.
   - **Check Phase:** The game checks if the new position is a mine or the goal.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules:**
   - Players must move forward; backward movement is not allowed.
   - Movement must result in landing on a valid position within the number line (no skipping beyond 20).

2. **Mine Interaction:**
   - If a player lands on a position containing an opponent's mine, they **immediately lose** the game.
   - The mine is revealed only when stepped on.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Reaching the Goal:** If a player successfully moves their token to **position 20** without triggering a mine, they win.
   - **Opponent Error:** If an opponent steps on your mine, you win.

4. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Players must infer the possible locations of opponent mines based on their own mine placements and the opponent's movements.
   - Bluffing and risk assessment are key components of advanced play.

## Scoring

- **Victory Conditions:**
  - The game does not use a point-based scoring system.
  - Winning is achieved by either reaching **position 20** safely or by the opponent triggering your mine.

- **Game Outcome:**
  - **Win:** Successfully reach the goal or cause your opponent to step on a mine.
  - **Loss:** Step on an opponentâ€™s mine or if unable to make a legal move (rare in this game).
