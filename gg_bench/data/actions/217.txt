The action space indices in the gym environment range from 0 to 29, each corresponding to selecting a number from 1 to 30 in the game. Specifically, each index `i` in the action space maps to the number `i + 1` in the game, making index 0 represent number 1, index 1 represent number 2, and so on up to index 29 representing number 30.
