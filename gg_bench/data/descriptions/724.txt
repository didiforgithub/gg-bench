# Game Title: Multiples Removal

## Objective

Be the player who removes the last number from the grid by strategically selecting numbers and eliminating them and their multiples from play.

## Setup

- **Grid Size:** A 3x3 grid.
- **Initial Arrangement:** The grid is filled with the numbers 1 through 9 arranged sequentially.

  ```
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
  7 8 9
  ```

- **Players:** Two players, referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.

## Game Components

- **Grid:** A simple 3x3 matrix representing the playing field.
- **Numbers:** The integers from 1 to 9, each occupying a unique cell in the grid.

  - **Appearance:** Each cell displays its corresponding number.
  - **Functionality:** Numbers are selected and removed based on the game rules.
  - **Unique Attributes:** Each number, when selected, affects the availability of other numbers (its multiples).

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players decide who goes first; turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Structure of a Turn:**
  1. **Selection Phase:** The current player selects an available number from the grid.
  2. **Removal Phase:** The selected number and all its available multiples are removed from the grid.
  3. **Turn End:** The turn ends, and play passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Number Selection:**
   - On your turn, you must select one available number from the grid.
   - The number must be among those not yet removed.

2. **Removal of Multiples:**
   - When a number is selected, it and all of its multiples that are still on the grid are removed from play.
   - **Example:** If you select `2`, you remove `2`, `4`, `6`, and `8` if they have not been removed already.

3. **Valid Moves:**
   - A move is valid only if there are numbers remaining on the grid at the start of your turn.
   - If there are no numbers left, the game ends.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player who removes the last available number from the grid wins the game.

### Additional Mechanics

- **No Skipping Turns:** Players must make a move on their turn if possible.
- **No Re-selection:** Removed numbers cannot be selected again.
- **Visibility:** Both players can see all available numbers on the grid at all times.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition:** Win by being the player to remove the last number from the grid.
- **No Points System:** The game does not use a points system; it is a win/loss game.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite number of numbers and mandatory move rule.

- **Number Selection:** Choosing numbers with many multiples can greatly reduce the opponent's available moves.
- **Forcing Moves:** Players can attempt to force their opponent into a position with only undesirable options.

## Additional Notes

- **Ease of Coding:** The game involves simple input/output and straightforward logic for removing numbers and their multiples.
- **No Random Elements:** The game is deterministic, relying purely on player decisions, allowing skill to be a decisive factor.
- **Game Duration:** Due to the elimination of multiple numbers in a single turn, games progress quickly.
