The action space consists of 20 discrete actions, each representing a weight and an operation. The indices are organized as follows: indices 0 to 9 represent adding weights 1 to 10, respectively, while indices 10 to 19 correspond to subtracting weights 1 to 10. For any given index `i` in the action space, the weight is calculated as `(i // 2) + 1`, and the operation is `+` if `i` is even and `-` if `i` is odd.
