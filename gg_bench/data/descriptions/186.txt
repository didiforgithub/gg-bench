# Sequence Shift

## Objective

Be the first player to arrange the shared sequence of numbers into ascending order from left to right by swapping adjacent numbers. The player who makes the final move that results in the fully sorted sequence wins the game.

## Setup

- A sequence of the numbers **1** through **9** is shuffled randomly to create a starting sequence.
- Both players can see the initial sequence.
- Decide which player goes first (Player 1). Players will take turns alternately.

**Example Initial Sequence:**

```
Initial Sequence: 5 3 8 1 4 9 2 6 7
```

## Game Components

- **Number Sequence:** A list containing the digits **1** through **9** in a random order.
- **Positions:** Each number in the sequence has a position from **1** to **9**, representing its place in the sequence from left to right.

**Visualization:**

```
Positions:        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Numbers:          5  3  8  1  4  9  2  6  7
```

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.
- **On a Player's Turn:**
  - The player must choose two adjacent positions in the sequence.
  - Swap the numbers at these two positions.
  - The updated sequence is displayed.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Swapping Adjacent Numbers:**
   - Only two numbers that are next to each other (adjacent) can be swapped.
   - For example, swapping positions **3** and **4** is allowed, but positions **3** and **5** is not.

2. **Valid Moves:**
   - A move consists of selecting two adjacent positions and swapping their numbers.
   - All moves are mandatory; a player cannot skip their turn.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game continues until the sequence is fully sorted in ascending order from **1** to **9**.
   - The player who makes the move that results in the sorted sequence wins.

4. **No Draws:**
   - Since the sequence is finite and each move progresses towards sorting, the game cannot end in a draw.

## Scoring

- The player who successfully arranges the entire sequence in ascending order wins the game.
- No points are tracked beyond determining the winner of the game.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Sequence:**

```
Positions:        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Numbers:          5  3  8  1  4  9  2  6  7
```

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Chooses to swap positions **2** and **3** (numbers **3** and **8**).
- **New Sequence:**

  ```
  Positions:        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  Numbers:          5  8  3  1  4  9  2  6  7
  ```

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Swaps positions **4** and **5** (numbers **1** and **4**).
- **New Sequence:**

  ```
  Positions:        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  Numbers:          5  8  3  4  1  9  2  6  7
  ```

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Swaps positions **1** and **2** (numbers **5** and **8**).
- **New Sequence:**

  ```
  Positions:        1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  Numbers:          8  5  3  4  1  9  2  6  7
  ```

---

*(Game continues with players strategically swapping adjacent numbers.)*

---

**Final Moves:**

Assuming the sequence is close to sorted:

```
Positions:        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Numbers:          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 8
```

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Swaps positions **8** and **9** (numbers **9** and **8**).
- **New Sequence:**

  ```
  Positions:        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  Numbers:          1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  ```

- The sequence is now fully sorted.
- **Player 2 wins the game!**

## Command-Line Interaction

**Prompt for Player Action:**

- The game displays the current sequence with positions.
- Prompts the current player to enter the positions they wish to swap.

**Example:**

```
Current Sequence:
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Numbers:   5 3 8 1 4 9 2 6 7

Player 1, enter two adjacent positions to swap (e.g., "2 3"): 
```

- The player inputs their move.
- The game updates the sequence and displays it before the next player's turn.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Think about how your swap will affect the sequence in future turns.
- **Block Your Opponent:** Anticipate your opponent's moves and make swaps that could prevent them from winning on their next turn.
- **Control Key Numbers:** Focus on moving smaller numbers toward the beginning and larger numbers toward the end of the sequence.
- **Forced Moves:** Try to force your opponent into a position where any move they make will set you up to win on your next turn.

## Conclusion

"Sequence Shift" is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent. With straightforward rules and minimal components, it's easy to play in a command-line interface and provides quick, engaging gameplay where skill can consistently triumph.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
