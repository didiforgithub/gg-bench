In the given gym environment for Sum Battle, the action space is represented by `Discrete(11)`, meaning there are 11 possible actions indexed from 0 to 10:

- Indices 1 to 10 correspond to selecting a number for attack from the Number Pool in the attack phase. Each index directly maps to the number itself (e.g., index 1 is number 1, index 2 is number 2, etc.).
- Index 0 is not used for selecting numbers from the pool, but in the defense phase, action values between 0 and the current attack number represent the block amount (e.g., 0 means blocking with zero sacrifice, up to the maximum attack number).
