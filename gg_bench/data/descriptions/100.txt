# Gridlock

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a valid move on the grid. Strategize your moves to outmaneuver your opponent by claiming cells while preventing yourself from being blocked.

## Setup

1. **Grid Initialization**: A 5x5 grid is prepared with all cells unclaimed.

2. **Player Assignment**:
   - **Player 1**: Symbolized by `'X'`.
   - **Player 2**: Symbolized by `'O'`.

3. **Starting the Game**:
   - Decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin or mutual agreement).
   - The game begins with Player 1 making the first move.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid representing the game board.
- **Cells**: Individual squares within the grid that can be claimed by players.
- **Player Symbols**:
  - `'X'` for Player 1.
  - `'O'` for Player 2.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- **On Your Turn**:
  - Enter the row and column number of an unclaimed cell you wish to claim.
  - Ensure the cell is valid according to the rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Claiming a Cell**:
   - You may claim any unclaimed cell **not adjacent** to any of your previously claimed cells.
   - **Adjacency** includes horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors.

2. **Adjacency Definition**:
   - A cell is adjacent if it shares a side or corner with your claimed cell.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your first turn, you may claim any cell since you have no prior claims.
   - Subsequent moves must comply with the non-adjacency rule relative to your claimed cells.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn, you lose the game.
   - Attempting to claim an adjacent cell to your own or an already claimed cell is invalid.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The winner is the last player able to make a valid move.
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Scoring

- No points are tracked; the objective is to win by making valid moves when your opponent cannot.

## Examples

#### Initial Grid

```
   0 1 2 3 4
0 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

```

#### Turn Sequence

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Claims cell at **(2,2)**.
   - Grid Update:

     ```
        0   1   2   3   4
     0 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
     3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     ```

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Claims cell at **(0,0)**.
   - Grid Update:

     ```
        0   1   2   3   4
     0 [O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
     3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     ```

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Cannot claim adjacent cells to (2,2).
   - Possible cells to claim: Any cell **not adjacent** to (2,2) and **not** adjacent to any of their own claimed cells.
   - Chooses to claim cell at **(4,4)**.
   - Grid Update:

     ```
        0   1   2   3   4
     0 [O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
     3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][X]
     ```

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Cannot claim adjacent cells to (0,0).
   - Chooses to claim cell at **(0,2)**.
   - Grid Update:

     ```
        0   1   2   3   4
     0 [O][ ][O][ ][ ]
     1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
     3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
     4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][X]
     ```

5. **Game Continues**:
   - Players alternate turns, claiming cells according to the rules.
   - They must avoid cells adjacent to their own claimed cells.

6. **End Game Scenario**:
   - Suppose Player 1 runs out of valid moves.
   - **Player 2** wins the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

#### Game Start

```
Welcome to Gridlock!

Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O), prepare to battle!

Player 1's Turn (X).
Enter the row and column of the cell you want to claim (e.g., '2 2'):
```

#### Player Inputs

- **Player 1**:
  ```
  2 2
  ```
  - Game Response:
    ```
    You have claimed cell (2,2).

    Current Grid:
       0   1   2   3   4
    0 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
    3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    Player 2's Turn (O).
    Enter the row and column of the cell you want to claim:
    ```

- **Player 2**:
  ```
  0 0
  ```
  - Game Response:
    ```
    You have claimed cell (0,0).

    Current Grid:
       0   1   2   3   4
    0 [O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
    3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    Player 1's Turn (X).
    Enter the row and column of the cell you want to claim:
    ```

#### Invalid Move Attempt

- **Player 1**:
  ```
  1 1
  ```
  - Game Response:
    ```
    Invalid move. The cell is adjacent to your previously claimed cell.

    Current Grid:
       0   1   2   3   4
    0 [O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
    3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

    Please enter a valid cell:
    ```

#### Continuation

- **Player 1** (chooses a valid cell):
  ```
  4 4
  ```
  - Game Response:
    ```
    You have claimed cell (4,4).

    Current Grid:
       0   1   2   3   4
    0 [O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    1 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    2 [ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
    3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
    4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][X]

    Player 2's Turn (O).
    Enter the row and column of the cell you want to claim:
    ```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**:
  - Anticipate future moves to ensure you have valid cells to claim later in the game.
  - Avoid isolating your claimed cells in a way that limits your options.

- **Blocking Opponent**:
  - While you cannot claim cells adjacent to your own, you might position your claims to limit the opponent's future moves.

- **Space Management**:
  - Control key areas of the grid to maximize your territory while restricting your opponent.

## Game End

- The game concludes when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **Announcement**:
  ```
  Player 1 has no valid moves left.
  Player 2 (O) wins the game! Congratulations!
  ```

## Summary

Gridlock is a game of strategic placement and foresight. Each move can open up new opportunities or close off paths. By carefully selecting which cells to claim, players can control the grid and outmaneuver their opponent.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
