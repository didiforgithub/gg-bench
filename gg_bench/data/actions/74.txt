In the action space of the CustomEnv, there are 20 discrete actions, each representing a move involving one of the 10 number tokens (1-10) paired with an operation (add or subtract). The mapping is as follows:

- Actions 0-9: Represent adding numbers 1-10 respectively.
- Actions 10-19: Represent subtracting numbers 1-10 respectively.

Each action index corresponds to a number and an operation combination, where the even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 18) are for adding, and the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., 19) are for subtracting the corresponding number (action index divided by 2 plus 1).
