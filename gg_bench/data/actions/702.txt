The action space indices in the gym environment correspond directly to the indices of the numbers in the pool, which are consecutive integers from 2 to 50. Each index represents a possible move, where the move is the selection of the number at that index within the pool. For example, if a player chooses an action with index 0, it corresponds to selecting the number 2; an index of 1 corresponds to selecting the number 3, and so on, up to index 48 for the number 50.
