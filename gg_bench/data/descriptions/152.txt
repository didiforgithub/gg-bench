# Numerical Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the shared total to **exactly zero** by strategically subtracting numbers. The player who achieves this goal on their turn wins the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Total**: The game begins with a shared total number, typically **23**.
- **Decide Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Shared Total Number**: An integer representing the current total, starting at 23.
- **Allowed Numbers**: The integers **1**, **2**, **3**, and **4** are the only numbers that can be subtracted from the total.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- On each turn, a player must subtract one of the allowed numbers from the current total.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Subtracting Numbers**: On your turn, choose a number between **1** and **4** (inclusive) to subtract from the current total.

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - You **cannot** subtract a number that would reduce the total below zero.
   - If no valid moves are available (all allowed numbers are greater than the current total), you **lose your turn**.

3. **Winning the Game**: The player who reduces the total to **exactly zero** on their turn **wins the game**.

4. **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw since the total can only reach zero through a player's valid move.

5. **Strategic Play**: Plan ahead to force your opponent into positions where they have limited options, paving the way for your victory.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who reduces the total to zero wins.
- **No Additional Scoring**: There are no points; the game is won by meeting the objective.

## Strategic Tips

- **Target Numbers**: Aim to leave the total at **multiples of 5** (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20). This strategy can force your opponent into positions where they cannot win.

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Consider the possible numbers your opponent can subtract and plan your moves to limit their options.

- **Control the Game Flow**: By carefully choosing your subtractions, you can control the pace of the game and steer it towards a win.

## Conclusion

**Numerical Duel** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and make calculated moves. With straightforward rules and quick gameplay, it provides an engaging experience where skillful play is rewarded.
