In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 5, representing moves of 1 to 6 nodes, respectively. The index value is incremented by one to obtain the move distance. For example, an action space index of 0 corresponds to moving 1 node, an index of 1 corresponds to moving 2 nodes, and so on up to an index of 5, which corresponds to moving 6 nodes.
