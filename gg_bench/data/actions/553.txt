In the gym environment for **Power Play**, the action space indices (0 to 7) correspond to the allowed multipliers in the game (2 to 9). This mapping is achieved by adding 2 to the action index, effectively translating the index range into the game's multiplier range. For example, an action index of 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2 (0 + 2 = 2), and an action index of 7 corresponds to a multiplier of 9 (7 + 2 = 9).
