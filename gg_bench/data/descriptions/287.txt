   - The cumulative total of the numbers in each player's stack starts at **0**.

3. **Starting the Game:**

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Stack Limits:**
   - The goal is to reach a **total stack sum of exactly 50**.
   - If a stack's total **exceeds 50**, the owner of that stack **immediately loses**.

2. **Mandatory Moves:**
   - Players **must draw a card** on their turn if there are cards remaining in the deck.
   - Players **must decide** to keep or give away the drawn card; skipping a turn is not allowed.

3. **Cards Cannot Be Moved:**
   - Once a card is placed on a stack, it **cannot be moved or removed**.

4. **Empty Deck:**
   - If the deck is exhausted, players continue to alternate turns without drawing cards.
   - On these turns, players have no action and simply pass to the next player.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player **wins immediately** if their stack's total reaches **exactly 50**.
   - A player **loses immediately** if their stack's total **exceeds 50**.

6. **Forced Moves:**
   - If a player draws a card and both choices (keeping or giving away) would cause a stack to exceed 50, they **must** select the option that **does not exceed** 50 if possible.
   - If both choices cause a stack to exceed 50, the player **must keep the card** and thus would lose as their stack exceeds 50.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition:**
  - Achieve a stack total of **exactly 50** before your opponent.
  
- **Defeat Condition:**
  - If your stack total **exceeds 50**, you **lose immediately**.
  
- **No Draws:**
  - The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.

## Strategic Tips

- **Monitor Stack Totals:**
  - Keep track of both stacks to make informed decisions.
  
- **Card Values:**
  - High-value cards (e.g., 8, 9, 10) can quickly increase a stack total.
  - Decide whether a high card benefits you more or puts your opponent at a disadvantage.

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves:**
  - Consider the possible cards remaining in the deck.
  - Think ahead about how your opponent might respond on their next turn.

- **Risk Management:**
  - Be cautious when your stack total is close to 50.
  - Giving low-value cards to your opponent when they are close to 50 might force them to exceed the limit.

## Conclusion

Number Stack Showdown is a game of both strategy and psychological warfare. By carefully choosing when to keep valuable cards and when to burden your opponent, you can outmaneuver them and reach the coveted total of 50. Stay sharp, plan ahead, and may the best strategist win!
