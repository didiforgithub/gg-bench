In the game, each action space index corresponds directly to selecting a number from the list of 1 to 20. The index `0` in the action space refers to selecting the number `1`, index `1` refers to `2`, index `2` refers to `3`, and so on up to index `19`, which corresponds to the number `20`. The action taken by a player maps to choosing the corresponding number from the list unless that number has already been taken or is invalid due to the game's rules.
