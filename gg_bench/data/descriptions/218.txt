# Prime Duel

## Objective

**Prime Duel** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to bring the shared total to a prime number greater than the target value. Players achieve victory by strategically selecting numbers to add to the shared total while preventing their opponent from reaching a prime total first. A player loses if they cause the total to exceed twice the target value without obtaining a prime number.

## Setup

1. **Initial Total**: The game begins with a shared total of **0**.
2. **Target Value**: Set a target value of **20** (modifiable for different difficulty levels).
3. **Available Numbers**: Both players have access to numbers **1** through **10** to add to the total.
4. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2) by mutual agreement or a random method.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Total**: A cumulative total that both players add to during the game.
- **Available Numbers**: Integers from **1** to **10**. These numbers can be reused and are accessible to both players each turn.
- **Target Value**: The threshold number (**20**) that the prime total must exceed to win.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen numbers through the command line when prompted.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
2. **Player Action**:
   - On their turn, a player selects a number between **1** and **10**.
   - The chosen number is added to the shared total.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After adding the number, the game evaluates if the new total meets any winning or losing conditions.
   - The turn passes to the next player if the game hasn't ended.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Adding Numbers**:
   - Players can choose any number from **1** to **10** on their turn.
   - Numbers can be reused; there are no limitations on the frequency of using a specific number.
2. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if the new shared total after their turn is a **prime number** **greater than the target value** (e.g., primes greater than **20** in this case).
3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's move causes the shared total to exceed **twice the target value** (i.e., total **> 40** with a target of **20**) **without** the total being a prime number greater than the target, they lose the game.
4. **Prime Numbers**:
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.
   - Examples of primes greater than **20**: **23, 29, 31, 37**.
5. **Invalid Moves**:
   - A player must select a number that keeps the total within permissible bounds (total â‰¤ **40** unless it's a winning prime).
   - Selecting a number that immediately causes a loss is allowed but strategically unsound.
6. **Draws**:
   - There are no draw conditions in this game. The game continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winning player is the one who first brings the shared total to a prime number greater than the target value.
- **Defeat**: A player loses if they cause the total to exceed twice the target value without achieving a winning prime total.
- **No Point System**: There are no points awarded; the outcome is a win or loss based on the game conditions.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Setup

- **Shared Total**: 0
- **Target Value**: 20
- **Players**: Player 1 and Player 2

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **7**.
   - Shared Total: 0 + 7 = **7**
   - The total is not a prime greater than 20; the game continues.
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses **8**.
   - Shared Total: 7 + 8 = **15**
   - The total is not a prime greater than 20; the game continues.
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **10**.
   - Shared Total: 15 + 10 = **25**
   - 25 is not a prime (it's 5 squared); the game continues.
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses **4**.
   - Shared Total: 25 + 4 = **29**
   - 29 is a prime number greater than 20.
   - **Player 2 wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
[Game Start]
Shared Total: 0
Target Value: 20

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a number between 1 and 10: 7
Shared Total is now 7.

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a number between 1 and 10: 8
Shared Total is now 15.

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a number between 1 and 10: 10
Shared Total is now 25.

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a number between 1 and 10: 4
Shared Total is now 29.
29 is a prime number greater than 20.
Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Aim for Prime Totals**: Keep track of the cumulative total and aim to reach a prime number greater than the target value on your turn.
- **Prevent Opponent's Win**: Be cautious not to set up the total in a way that allows your opponent to win on their next turn.
- **Calculate Ahead**: Anticipate the sums of future moves to block your opponent's path to victory.
- **Stay Within Bounds**: Avoid moves that bring the total dangerously close to the losing threshold (twice the target value) unless it leads to a win.

## Additional Notes

- **Adjustable Difficulty**: You can modify the target value or the range of available numbers to adjust the game's difficulty and length.
- **No Luck Involved**: The game is deterministic with no element of chance, ensuring that skillful play determines the winner.
- **Learning Curve**: While the rules are simple, mastering the strategy requires practice and foresight.

Enjoy playing **Prime Duel** and may the best strategist win!
