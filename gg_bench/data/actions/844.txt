In the provided Python code for the gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(8)`, representing the multipliers available in the game, specifically the numbers 2 through 9. Each action space index corresponds to a specific multiplier, starting with index 0 for the smallest multiplier.

The mapping is as follows:
- Action index `0` corresponds to the multiplier `2`.
- Action index `1` corresponds to the multiplier `3`.
- Action index `2` corresponds to the multiplier `4`.
- Action index `3` corresponds to the multiplier `5`.
- Action index `4` corresponds to the multiplier `6`.
- Action index `5` corresponds to the multiplier `7`.
- Action index `6` corresponds to the multiplier `8`.
- Action index `7` corresponds to the multiplier `9`.

This mapping allows players to choose a multiplier from the available set by selecting the corresponding action index.
