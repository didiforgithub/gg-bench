The action space indices in the game correspond to possible moves, represented by pairs of starting and ending bit positions in the sequence. There are 55 possible actions because each start position (0 to 9) can pair with each end position (ranging from the start position to 9), forming a unique action for flipping that consecutive group of bits from `0` to `1`. The action-to-move mapping creates this list of pairs, where each index in the action space corresponds to one of these (start, end) pairs, allowing players to choose specific sequences of bits to flip during their turn.
