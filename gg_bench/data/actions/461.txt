In the game, each action index between 0 and 18 corresponds to a specific move:

- **Action indices 0-8**: Represent the "Subtract Digit" action for digits 1 through 9. The index `i` corresponds to subtracting the digit `i + 1` from N (e.g., action 0 means subtract 1).
  
- **Action indices 9-18**: Represent the "Remove Digit" action for digits 0 through 9. The index `i` corresponds to removing the digit `i - 9` from N (e.g., action 9 means remove 0).

This design ensures that each possible digit operation is uniquely represented by an action index.
