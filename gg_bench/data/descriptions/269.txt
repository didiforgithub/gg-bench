# Division Duel

## Objective

**Division Duel** is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Players take turns dividing a shared number by valid divisors, and the player who cannot perform a division on their turn loses the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer called the **Current Number**. The default starting number is **100**, but players can agree on any positive integer greater than **1** to start the game.
- **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly or by agreement.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A positive integer that both players manipulate during the game. It is updated after each turn.
- **Valid Divisors**: Integers greater than **1** and less than the **Current Number** that exactly divide the **Current Number** (i.e., leave no remainder).
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen divisors on their turn.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Current Number**: At the start of a player's turn, the **Current Number** is displayed.
  2. **Input Divisor**: The player selects a **Valid Divisor** of the **Current Number** and inputs it.
  3. **Update Current Number**: The **Current Number** is updated by dividing it by the chosen **Valid Divisor**.
  4. **Turn Ends**: The turn passes to the other player.

- **Valid Actions**:
  - A player must select a **Valid Divisor** of the **Current Number**.
  - Divisors must be greater than **1** and less than the **Current Number**.
  - The divisor must exactly divide the **Current Number** (no remainders).

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Divisors**:
  - On each turn, players can only choose divisors that meet the following criteria:
    - **Greater than 1**: Divisors must be at least **2**.
    - **Less than Current Number**: Divisors cannot be equal to the **Current Number**.
    - **Exact Division**: Dividing the **Current Number** by the divisor must result in an integer with no remainder.

- **Updating Current Number**:
  - After a valid divisor is chosen, divide the **Current Number** by this divisor.
  - The result becomes the new **Current Number** for the next player's turn.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player **loses** if, on their turn, there are no valid divisors available for the **Current Number**.
  - The opponent is then declared the **winner**.

- **No Repetition Rule**:
  - Divisors can be reused in subsequent turns as long as they are valid for the current **Current Number**.

## Scoring

- **Single-Round Victory**: The game is typically played in single rounds where the winner is the player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of victories, and the player with the most wins after a set number of rounds is the overall winner.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number**: 100

#### Turn 1:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - **Current Number**: 100
  - **Valid Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
  - **Player 1 Chooses**: 2
  - **New Current Number**: 100 รท 2 = **50**

#### Turn 2:
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - **Current Number**: 50
  - **Valid Divisors**: 2, 5, 10, 25
  - **Player 2 Chooses**: 5
  - **New Current Number**: 50 รท 5 = **10**

#### Turn 3:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - **Current Number**: 10
  - **Valid Divisors**: 2, 5
  - **Player 1 Chooses**: 2
  - **New Current Number**: 10 รท 2 = **5**

#### Turn 4:
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - **Current Number**: 5
  - **Valid Divisors**: (None, since divisors must be greater than 1 and less than 5, and 5 is prime)
  - **Player 2 has no valid moves and loses**
- **Player 1 Wins**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Starting Number: 100
Player 1's Turn:
Current Number is 100
Valid Divisors are: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
Enter your divisor: 2

Player 1 divides 100 by 2
Current Number is now 50

Player 2's Turn:
Current Number is 50
Valid Divisors are: 2, 5, 10, 25
Enter your divisor: 5

Player 2 divides 50 by 5
Current Number is now 10

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number is 10
Valid Divisors are: 2, 5
Enter your divisor: 2

Player 1 divides 10 by 2
Current Number is now 5

Player 2's Turn:
Current Number is 5
No valid divisors available.
Player 2 cannot make a move. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Depth

- **Prime Numbers**: Reducing the **Current Number** to a prime number can be a strategic move, limiting the opponent's options.
- **Divisor Choices**: Selecting divisors that result in unfavorable numbers for your opponent adds depth to the game.
- **Anticipation**: Skilled players will anticipate future moves and plan several steps ahead to force a win.

## Tips for Players

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the possible resulting numbers after each potential divisor to predict your opponent's options.
- **Avoid Small Numbers Early**: Reducing the **Current Number** too quickly can backfire if it gives your opponent the advantage.
- **Use Larger Divisors When Advantageous**: Sometimes using a larger divisor can force the **Current Number** into a prime or unfavorable number for your opponent.
