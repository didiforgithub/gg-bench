- **Initial Laser Charge:** Each player's laser charge starts at **0**.

**Game Components:**

- **Shield Strength (0 - 10):** Represents the player's defensive capability. Starting at 10, it decreases as the player takes damage.

---

**Turns:**

   - **Elimination:** If your shield strength reaches **0 or below**, you lose the game.

   - **No Passing:** You must perform one of the two actions on your turn; skipping a turn is not allowed.
  
5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to reduce their opponent's shield strength to **0 or below** wins.
  
6. **Gameplay Constraints:**

**Strategies & Tips:**

1. **Balancing Charge and Attack:**
   - Charging your laser for a stronger attack can be beneficial but beware of giving your opponent time to retaliate.
   - Sometimes, firing with a lower charge can prevent your opponent from building up a high charge.

2. **Monitor Opponent's Charge:**
   - Keep track of your opponent's laser charge to anticipate their potential damage.
   - If they are close to a high charge, you may choose to fire early to deplete their shield before they can hit you harder.

3. **Forced Firing:**
   - Remember that reaching a laser charge of **5** forces you to fire on your next turn. Use this to your advantage or to predict your opponent's moves.

4. **Defensive Play:**
   - If your shield strength is low, consider firing more frequently to prevent your opponent from charging up.

---

**Command-Line Interaction Example:**

- **Prompt:** It's your turn. Your shield is at 10, and your laser charge is at 2. Do you want to (1) Charge Laser or (2) Fire Laser?
- **Player Input:** 1
- **System:** You have chosen to charge your laser. Your laser charge is now 3.
