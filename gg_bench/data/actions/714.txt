In the Number Line Duel gym environment, the action space indices map to game moves as follows:

- **Actions 0-9**: Each corresponds to crossing out a single number on the number line, where:
  - Action 0 crosses out the number 1,
  - Action 1 crosses out the number 2,
  - and so on up to Action 9, which crosses out the number 10.

- **Actions 10-18**: Each corresponds to crossing out two consecutive numbers on the number line, where:
  - Action 10 crosses out the numbers 1 and 2,
  - Action 11 crosses out the numbers 2 and 3,
  - and so on up to Action 18, which crosses out the numbers 9 and 10.
