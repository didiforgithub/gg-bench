In the Grid Lock game environment, the action space consists of 16 discrete actions, each representing one of the 16 cells on the 4x4 grid. The indices range from 0 to 15, corresponding directly to the cell numbers arranged in sequential order from left to right, top to bottom. Selecting an action index in the action space maps to claiming the corresponding cell on the physical grid, where:

- Index 0 corresponds to cell 1,
- Index 1 corresponds to cell 2,
- ...
- Index 15 corresponds to cell 16.

Thus, each index directly maps to a specific cell number, allowing players to choose and claim an unclaimed and unblocked cell on their turn.
