In the **Even/Odd Match** game environment, each action space index from 0 to 19 corresponds to a potential move, where the index \(i\) represents choosing the number \(i+1\) from the shared list. Thus, action space index 0 maps to removing the number 1, index 1 to removing the number 2, and so forth, up to index 19, which maps to removing the number 20. Valid moves are determined by the presence of these numbers in the current game state and adherence to parity rules.
