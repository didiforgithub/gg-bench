## Turns

### Structure of a Round

   - Both players select one card from their remaining hand.
   - Selection is done secretly.
   - Once a card is selected, it cannot be changed.

2. **Card Reveal**:
   - Players simultaneously reveal their selected cards.
   - The values are compared to determine the winner of the round.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Points are awarded based on the comparison of the cards.
   - The scoreboard is updated with the new scores.

4. **Progression**:
   - The played cards are discarded from the players' hands.
   - The game proceeds to the next round until all five rounds are completed.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Card Selection

- Players must choose one card per round from their remaining cards.
- Cards are chosen without knowledge of the opponent's selection.
- Each card can only be played once per game.

### 2. Card Reveal and Comparison

- After selection, both players reveal their cards at the same time.
- The numbers on the cards are compared to determine the outcome:

  - **Higher Card Wins**:
    - The player with the higher number wins the round.
    - The winner earns **1 point**.
  - **Tie**:
    - If both players reveal cards with the same number, the tie-breaker rule is applied.

### 3. Tie-Breaker Rule

- **Tie in the First Round**:
  - If a tie occurs in the first round, neither player earns points for that round.
- **Tie in Subsequent Rounds**:
  - The player who played the **lower-numbered card in the previous round** wins the tie.
  - The tie-breaker winner earns **2 points** for the round.
- **No Previous Round Difference (Another Tie)**:
  - If the previous round was also a tie, compare the last round where the cards were different.
  - Continue backward until a difference is found.
  - If all previous rounds are ties, neither player earns points for the current round.

### 4. Scoring

- **Winning a Round**: The player earns **1 point**.
- **Winning a Tie via Tie-Breaker**: The player earns **2 points**.
- **Tie with No Tie-Breaker Winner**: No points are awarded.

### 5. End of the Game

- After five rounds, the player with the **highest total score** wins.
- Since the total number of points possible is odd, a tie in total score is impossible.
