In the "Prime Claim" game environment, the action space indices from 0 to 24 correspond directly to the numbers 1 to 25 in the game. Each index `i` in the action space represents the number `i + 1` that can be claimed from the shared number pool. For example, an action space index of 0 represents claiming the number 1, an index of 1 corresponds to claiming the number 2, and so on, up to index 24 for claiming the number 25.
