# Battle of Divisors

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce your score exactly to zero by strategically subtracting divisors of your current score.

## Setup

- **Starting Scores:** Both players begin with a score of **50**.
- **First Player:** Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Player Scores:** Each player maintains their own current score.
- **Divisors (1-10):** Numbers from 1 to 10 that are divisors of the player's current score.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- **On Your Turn:**
  1. **Check Current Score:** Know your current score.
  2. **List Possible Moves:** Identify all numbers between 1 and 10 that are divisors of your current score.
  3. **Choose a Divisor:** Select one divisor from your list.
  4. **Subtract Divisor:** Subtract the chosen number from your current score.
- The turn passes to the other player after the move.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - The chosen number must be an integer between 1 and 10.
   - It must be a divisor of your current score (i.e., your score divided by the number leaves no remainder).
2. **Score Reduction:**
   - Subtract the chosen divisor from your current score to get your new score.
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to reduce their score exactly to **zero** wins.
4. **No Valid Moves:**
   - If you have no valid divisors between 1 and 10 on your turn, you **lose** the game.
5. **Example Divisors:**
   - If your current score is **40**, valid divisors between 1 and 10 are **1, 2, 4, 5, 8,** and **10**.
6. **Strategic Play:**
   - Plan moves to avoid leaving yourself with no valid options.
   - Aim to force your opponent into a position with limited moves.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition:** Reduce your score to zero before your opponent.
- There are no points awarded; the focus is on reaching zero first.

Enter a number to subtract: 10
Your new score is 40.

Player 2's turn.
Your current score is 50.
Possible divisors between 1 and 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
Enter a number to subtract: 5
Your new score is 45.

...

Player 1's turn.
Your current score is 8.
Possible divisors between 1 and 10: 1, 2, 4, 8
Enter a number to subtract: 8
Your new score is 0.
Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Think Ahead:** Anticipate future moves based on your current score and possible divisors.
- **Control the Game:** Try to leave your opponent with scores that have fewer valid divisors.
- **Avoid Traps:** Be cautious of moves that might leave you without a valid next move.
