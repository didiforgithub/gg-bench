The action space indices in the game environment range from 0 to 9, each corresponding to selecting a number from 1 to 10 in the game. Specifically, the action index `i` represents choosing the number `i + 1`. Thus, selecting an action of index 0 results in choosing the number 1, an action of index 1 results in choosing the number 2, and so on, up to an action index of 9, which corresponds to choosing the number 10. This mapping allows players to interact with the game using indices in the action space to pick numbers from the available pool.
