In the game, each action corresponds to an index in the action space:

- **Action 0**: Subtract 1 from the current number.
- **Action 1**: Subtract 2 from the current number.
- **Action 2**: Multiply the current number by 0.5, only if the number is even.
- **Action 3**: Add 5 to the current number, only if the number is less than 10.
