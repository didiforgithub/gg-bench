The action space in the game is represented by a discrete space with indices corresponding to the list of prime numbers under 30: `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]`. Each index in the action space corresponds to selecting a specific prime number from this list, which a player can use to multiply their current score. For example, an action index of `0` selects the prime `2`, an index of `1` selects the prime `3`, and so on up to index `9`, which selects the prime `29`. This mapping allows players to choose and apply a prime number as their move each turn.
