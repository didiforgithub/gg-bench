# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Be the player who reduces the shared positive integer **N** to exactly **1** by strategically dividing or subtracting according to the game's rules. The player who performs the action that results in **N** becoming **1** wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number Selection**: Both players agree on a starting positive integer **N**, where **N > 1**. This number will be used as the initial shared number for the game.
2. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement, flipping a coin, or any other random method.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer greater than **1** that both players will manipulate during their turns. The value of **N** changes as the game progresses.
- **Proper Divisors**: Integers **d** such that **1 < d < N** and **d** evenly divides **N** (i.e., **N** mod **d** equals **0**).
- **Players**: Two participants who will take turns modifying the shared number **N** according to the game's rules.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with the player determined during setup.
   - On each turn, the active player must perform one of the allowed actions based on the current value of **N**.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - **If N is Composite (Non-Prime and Greater Than 1)**:
     - The player must choose a proper divisor **d** of **N**.
     - Then, divide **N** by **d** (**N = N / d**).
   - **If N is Prime**:
     - The player must subtract **1** from **N** (**N = N - 1**).

3. **Updating N**:
   - After the player's action, **N** is updated to the new value.
   - The updated **N** is used by the next player on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Proper Divisors**:
  - A proper divisor of **N** is any integer **d** where **1 < d < N** and **d** divides **N** without leaving a remainder.
  - The player cannot choose **1** or **N** as a divisor when **N** is composite.

- **Composite and Prime Numbers**:
  - **Composite Number**: A positive integer greater than **1** that has at least one positive divisor other than **1** and itself.
  - **Prime Number**: A positive integer greater than **1** that has no positive divisors other than **1** and itself.

- **Valid Moves**:
  - **Division Move**: When **N** is composite, dividing **N** by a proper divisor is the only allowed action.
  - **Subtraction Move**: When **N** is prime, subtracting **1** is the only allowed action.

- **Game End Condition**:
  - The game ends when **N** is reduced to exactly **1**.
  - The player whose action results in **N = 1** is declared the winner.

- **Invalid Moves**:
  - If a player cannot perform a valid action on their turn (which should not occur if rules are followed), they forfeit the game.
  - Players must ensure that after their move, **N** remains a positive integer greater than or equal to **1**.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The primary goal is to win the game by being the player who reduces **N** to **1** on their turn.
- **No Points System**: There is no point or scoring system beyond determining the winner of each game.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players may decide to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of games each player wins.
  - The player with the most game wins after a set number of rounds is the overall winner.

## Examples

Below are example scenarios to illustrate how the game is played in practice.

### Example 1: Starting with N = 12

#### Initial Setup

- **N = 12**
- **Player 1** starts the game.

#### Game Play

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N is 12**, which is composite.
   - Proper divisors of 12 (excluding 1 and 12): **2, 3, 4, 6**.
   - Player 1 chooses **d = 6**.
   - **N = 12 / 6 = 2**.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **N is 2**, which is prime.
   - Player 2 must subtract **1**.
   - **N = 2 - 1 = 1**.
   - **Player 2 wins** by reducing **N** to **1**.

### Example 2: Starting with N = 15

#### Initial Setup

- **N = 15**
- **Player 1** starts the game.

#### Game Play

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N is 15**, which is composite.
   - Proper divisors of 15: **3, 5**.
   - Player 1 chooses **d = 5**.
   - **N = 15 / 5 = 3**.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **N is 3**, which is prime.
   - Player 2 subtracts **1**.
   - **N = 3 - 1 = 2**.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N is 2**, which is prime.
   - Player 1 subtracts **1**.
   - **N = 2 - 1 = 1**.
   - **Player 1 wins** by reducing **N** to **1**.

### Example 3: Starting with N = 18

#### Initial Setup

- **N = 18**
- **Player 1** starts the game.

#### Game Play

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N is 18**, which is composite.
   - Proper divisors of 18: **2, 3, 6, 9**.
   - Player 1 chooses **d = 9**.
   - **N = 18 / 9 = 2**.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **N is 2**, which is prime.
   - Player 2 subtracts **1**.
   - **N = 2 - 1 = 1**.
   - **Player 2 wins** by reducing **N** to **1**.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Here's how the game might look in a command-line interface:

```
Game Start!
Enter starting number N (>1): 15

Player 1's turn.
Current N: 15
N is composite.
Available divisors: 3, 5
Enter a proper divisor of N: 5
N is now: 3

Player 2's turn.
Current N: 3
N is prime.
Subtracting 1 from N.
N is now: 2

Player 1's turn.
Current N: 2
N is prime.
Subtracting 1 from N.
N is now: 1

Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Choosing Proper Divisors Wisely**: When **N** is composite, consider the resulting **N** after division. Aim to force your opponent into a position where they have to face a prime **N**, limiting their options.
- **Anticipate Prime Numbers**: If you can foresee that dividing **N** by a certain proper divisor will leave a prime number for your opponent, it might be advantageous.
- **Endgame Planning**: Keep track of the sequence of moves that will lead **N** to **1** and try to control the flow so that you make the final move.

## Game Complexity

While the rules are simple, the game offers strategic depth. Players must analyze the factors of the current **N**, anticipate subsequent prime numbers, and plan ahead to control the game's progression. Mastery comes with understanding number properties and predicting the opponent's potential moves.
