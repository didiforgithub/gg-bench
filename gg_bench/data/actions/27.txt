In this game, the action space indices represent the positions of digits in the current shared number. A valid move involves selecting an index corresponding to a digit you want to delete. For example, if the current number is `123456`, the indices are:

- 0: Delete the digit '1'
- 1: Delete the digit '2'
- 2: Delete the digit '3'
- 3: Delete the digit '4'
- 4: Delete the digit '5'
- 5: Delete the digit '6'

The chosen index must ensure that the resulting number remains a valid positive integer, with no leading zeros. The environment checks for these conditions during each player's turn.
