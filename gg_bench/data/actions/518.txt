The action space indices in the game map directly to the indices of nodes on the game board. Each index in the action space corresponds to a node's index, representing a potential move to that node. The mapping is established through the `node_labels` and `node_indices` lists, where each index in the action space can be used to look up the respective node label. When a player chooses an action, it is interpreted as selecting a move to the node associated with that index, provided the move adheres to the game's adjacency and numerical movement rules.
