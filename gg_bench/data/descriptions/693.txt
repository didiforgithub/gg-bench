**Game Title:** **Path Pursuit**

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to reach your opponent's home node by moving your token strategically along a linear path while blocking or capturing the opponent's token.

---

**Setup:**

- **Game Board:** A linear path consisting of 11 sequentially numbered nodes arranged in a straight line from Node 1 to Node 11.
- **Player Tokens:** Each player has a unique token representing their position on the path.
  - **Player 1's Token:** Starts on **Node 1** (Player 1's home node).
  - **Player 2's Token:** Starts on **Node 11** (Player 2's home node).
- **Starting Conditions:** Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss). Turns alternate between players.

---

**Game Components:**

1. **Path Nodes (1-11):**
   - Visualized as a straight line with positions numbered from 1 to 11.
   - Represents the spaces along which players move their tokens.

2. **Player Tokens:**
   - **Appearance:** Unique identifiers for each player (e.g., "P1" for Player 1 and "P2" for Player 2).
   - **Functionality:** Indicates the current position of each player on the path.
   - **Attributes:** Cannot occupy the same node unless capturing the opponent's token.

---

**Turns:**

- **Turn Structure:**
  - The game proceeds in alternate turns starting with the designated first player.
  - During a turn, the active player performs the following steps:
    1. **Determine Maximum Move Distance:**
       - Based on the rules, calculate the maximum number of nodes the player can move.
    2. **Choose Movement:** 
       - Decide how many nodes to move (must be at least 1 and no more than 6).
    3. **Move Token:**
       - Advance the token towards the opponent's home node according to the chosen movement.
    4. **Check for Win Conditions:**
       - Determine if the move results in capturing the opponent's token or reaching the opponent's home node.
    5. **End Turn:**
       - If the game hasn't been won, pass the turn to the opponent.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Movement Rules:**
   - Players move their tokens towards the opponent's home node.
     - **Player 1** moves from lower to higher numbered nodes (Node 1 ➔ Node 11).
     - **Player 2** moves from higher to lower numbered nodes (Node 11 ➔ Node 1).
   - On each turn, a player may move their token forward **1 to 6 nodes**.

2. **Maximum Movement Restriction:**
   - A player **cannot move past** the opponent's current position.
   - The maximum move distance is calculated as the number of nodes up to (but not including) the opponent's node.
     - Example: If Player 1 is on Node 3 and Player 2 is on Node 6, Player 1 can move a maximum of 2 nodes (to Node 5).

3. **Capturing the Opponent's Token:**
   - If a player **lands on** the node occupied by the opponent's token, they **capture** the opponent's token and **win** the game immediately.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins by either:
     - **Reaching the Opponent's Home Node:** Landing on the opponent's starting node.
     - **Capturing the Opponent's Token:** Landing on the node currently occupied by the opponent's token.

5. **Blocked Movement:**
   - If a player cannot move forward because the opponent's token is immediately ahead (no available nodes to advance), they must **pass their turn**.

6. **No Backward Movement:**
   - Players cannot move their tokens backward along the path.

---

**Scoring:**

- This game is a **win/loss** game without a point system.
- The player who successfully reaches the opponent's home node or captures the opponent's token wins.
- There are no draws in this game.

**Examples:**

**Example Scenario 1:**

*Initial Positions:*
- Player 1 is on Node 1.
- Player 2 is on Node 11.

---

*Turn-by-Turn Play:*

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Opponent's Position: Node 11
   - Maximum Move: 6 nodes (since Nodes 2-11 are unoccupied).
   - Player 1 chooses to move **6 nodes** to Node **7**.

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Opponent's Position: Node 7
   - Maximum Move: 4 nodes (cannot move past Node 7).
   - Player 2 chooses to move **4 nodes** to Node **7**.
   - Player 2 lands on Node 7, occupied by Player 1.
   - **Player 2 captures Player 1's token and wins the game.**

---

**Example Scenario 2:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Opponent's Position: Node 11
   - Maximum Move: 6 nodes
   - Player 1 moves **5 nodes** to Node **6**.

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Opponent's Position: Node 6
   - Maximum Move: 5 nodes
   - Player 2 moves **5 nodes** to Node **6**.
   - Player 2 lands on Node 6, occupied by Player 1.
   - **Player 2 captures Player 1's token and wins the game.**

---

**Example Scenario 3 (Defensive Play):**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Player 1 moves **3 nodes** to Node **4**.

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Player 2 moves **6 nodes** to Node **5**.

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Opponent's Position: Node 5
   - Maximum Move: 0 nodes (cannot move to or past Node 5)
   - **Player 1 must pass their turn.**

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Player 2 moves **1 node** to Node **4**.
   - **Player 2 captures Player 1's token and wins the game.**

---

**Command-Line Interaction:**

*Sample Turn:*

```
Player 1's Turn
----------------
Your Position: Node 1
Opponent's Position: Node 11
Maximum Move Distance: 6
Enter number of nodes to move (1-6): 6

Player 1 moves to Node 7.

Player 2's Turn
----------------
Your Position: Node 11
Opponent's Position: Node 7
Maximum Move Distance: 4
Enter number of nodes to move (1-4): 4

Player 2 moves to Node 7.
Player 2 lands on Node 7 and captures Player 1's token.

Player 2 wins the game!
```

**Strategic Depth and Complexity:**

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves:**
  - Predict the opponent's possible movements to avoid being captured.
  
- **Control Key Nodes:**
  - Occupy strategic nodes to limit the opponent's movement options.

- **Balance Risk and Reward:**
  - Decide when to advance aggressively or play defensively.

- **Movement Calculation:**
  - Carefully calculate maximum movement based on both positions to optimize your strategy.

---

**Strategic Tips:**

1. **Avoid Immediate Confrontation:**
   - Be cautious about moving to nodes where the opponent can capture you on their next turn.

2. **Force Opponent to Pass:**
   - Position yourself to restrict the opponent’s movement, potentially forcing them to skip their turn.

3. **Maximize Distance When Safe:**
   - Advance the maximum allowed nodes when the opponent cannot immediately reach you.

4. **Predictive Blocking:**
   - Anticipate the opponent’s maximum movement and position yourself accordingly.

---

**Notes on Fair Play:**

- Players should ensure their inputs adhere to the rules.
- Invalid moves (e.g., moving beyond the maximum allowed nodes) should prompt an error and a chance to re-enter a valid move.
