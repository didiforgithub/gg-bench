In the gym environment, the action space is represented as a discrete space with indices corresponding to the allowed prime numbers. Each index in the action space maps directly to a prime number that can be subtracted from the current value of N. The mapping is as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the prime number 2.
- Index 1 corresponds to the prime number 3.
- Index 2 corresponds to the prime number 5.
- Index 3 corresponds to the prime number 7.

When an action is taken in the environment, the selected index determines which prime number is subtracted from N.
