# **Capture the Line**: Rule Book

---

## **Objective**

Be the first player to reach the center point of a linear path by strategically advancing your position. The primary goal is to occupy the central point (Point 6) before your opponent does, thereby achieving victory. A player wins by being the first to land exactly on Point 6 according to the movement rules.

---

## **Setup**

- **Game Path**: A linear sequence of 11 consecutive points numbered from 1 to 11.
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1** starts on **Point 1**.
  - **Player 2** starts on **Point 11**.
  
At the beginning of the game, both players are positioned at opposite ends of the line, ready to advance towards the center point.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Linear Path**: Represented in the command-line interface as a series of numbered positions from 1 to 11.
  
  Example representation:

  ```
  [1] - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - [11]
  ```
  
- **Player Markers**: Each player is represented by their position number on the path.
  - **Player 1**: Travels from Point 1 towards Point 6.
  - **Player 2**: Travels from Point 11 towards Point 6.

No physical pieces are required; the game state is maintained through numerical positions within the interface.

## **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions per Turn**:
  - A player may move their marker **1 or 2 points forward** towards the center (Point 6).
  
---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Movement**:
   - On your turn, choose to move **either 1 or 2 points forward** along the path towards Point 6.
   - Movement is only towards the center; you cannot move backward.

2. **Occupied Points**:
   - Both players cannot occupy the same point simultaneously.
   - Players **cannot pass each other**. If a player's move would land them on or beyond the opponent's current position, they must adjust their move:
     - If moving 2 points would cause them to pass or land on the opponent, they must move only 1 point.
     - If moving 1 point would also result in passing or landing on the opponent, the player **cannot move** and **loses their turn**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to land **exactly on Point 6** wins the game.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn per the movement rules, they **lose their turn**, and play passes to the opponent.
   - **No Draws**: The gameplay mechanics ensure that one player will reach the center point before the other, making draws impossible.

4. **Special Conditions**:
   - If a move would cause a player to go beyond Point 6, they must adjust their move to land exactly on Point 6 if possible.
   - If neither a 1-point nor a 2-point move lands a player on Point 6 without violating the occupied points rule, they must **skip their turn**.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory**: Achieved by the first player to reach Point 6.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use a scoring system; the outcome is win or loss based on reaching the objective.
