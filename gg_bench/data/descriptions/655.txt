   - **Unique Usage**: Each prime number can be used only once per game.
   - **Input Validation**: Players must select a valid prime from the pool.

2. ### **Applying Damage**

   - **Life Reduction**: The selected prime number is subtracted from the opponent's life total.
   - **Minimum Life Total**: Life totals can drop below zero; negative values indicate defeat.

3. ### **Winning the Game**

   - **Victory by Depletion**: If a player's life total reaches **zero or below**, the game ends immediately, and their opponent wins.
   - **Victory by Superiority**: If all prime numbers have been used and no player's life total is zero or below, the player with the **higher life total** wins.
   - **No Draws**: If life totals are equal when all primes are exhausted, the **last player to take a turn loses**, ensuring a decisive outcome.

4. ### **Life Total Management**

   - **No Healing**: Life totals cannot be increased during the game.
   - **Display Updates**: Life totals are updated and displayed after each turn.
