In the game, the action space indices map directly to the number of positions a player can move forward. Specifically, the indices 0, 1, and 2 correspond to moving forward 1, 2, and 3 positions, respectively. This mapping allows players to choose from three discrete move options on their turn: advancing their token 1, 2, or 3 spaces along the number ladder.
