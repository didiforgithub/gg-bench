In the given gym environment for the game "Divide and Conquer," the action space indices range from 0 to 98, corresponding to selecting divisors D such that D = action + 2. This maps the indices directly to divisors starting from 2 up to a maximum of 100. Thus, an action index of 0 corresponds to choosing the divisor 2, an action index of 1 corresponds to choosing the divisor 3, and so on, up to an action index of 98 corresponding to the divisor 100. This ensures that each action index directly correlates with a possible divisor D in the game, adjusted for the divisor range.
