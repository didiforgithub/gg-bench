# Prime Duel

## Objective

**Be the first to force your opponent to announce a composite (non-prime) number.** Players take turns adding to a running total, aiming to keep the total a prime number. The player who is compelled to announce a composite number loses the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players participate in the game, designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
2. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a **current number of 1**.
3. **Roles**: Decide which player will be Player 1 and Player 2. Player 1 takes the first turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A single number that both players manipulate during their turns. It starts at **1**.
- **Allowed Additions**: Players may add either **1** or **2** to the current number on their turn.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Announcement**: At the start of their turn, the player notes the current number.
2. **Action**: The player chooses to add **1** or **2** to the current number.
3. **Calculation**: The player calculates the **new total** by adding their chosen number to the current number.
4. **Declaration**: The player announces the new total.

### Progression of Turns

- **Alternating Turns**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Completion**: After a player announces a prime number as the new total, the turn passes to the opponent.
- **Game End**: If a player announces a composite number as the new total, the game ends immediately, and that player loses.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**: On each turn, a player must add either **1** or **2** to the current number.
2. **Prime Requirement**: The new total **must be a prime number** for the game to continue.
3. **Composite Number**: If the new total is a **composite number**, the player who announced it **loses the game**.
4. **Accurate Calculation**: Players must correctly calculate and announce the new total.
5. **Prime Identification**: Players are responsible for identifying whether the new total is prime.
6. **Challenge Mechanism**:
   - If a player mistakenly declares a composite number as prime, the opponent can **challenge**.
   - If the challenge is correct (the number is composite), the player who made the mistake **loses**.
   - If the challenge is incorrect (the number is prime), the challenger **loses**.
7. **Starting Number**: The number **1** is not considered prime or composite; it is simply the starting point.
8. **Prime Numbers**: Recognize that numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., are prime.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who forces their opponent to announce a composite number **wins the game**.
- **No Point Tracking**: There is no point system; victory is determined by the game's immediate outcome.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Starting Number**: 1

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Adds **2** to 1.
   - New total: **3**.
   - 3 is prime.
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Adds **2** to 3.
   - New total: **5**.
   - 5 is prime.
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Adds **2** to 5.
   - New total: **7**.
   - 7 is prime.
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Adds **2** to 7.
   - New total: **9**.
   - 9 is composite (since 9 = 3 Ã— 3).
   - **Player 2 loses**; **Player 1 wins**.

### Example Game 2

**Starting Number**: 1

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Adds **1** to 1.
   - New total: **2**.
   - 2 is prime.
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Adds **1** to 2.
   - New total: **3**.
   - 3 is prime.
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Adds **2** to 3.
   - New total: **5**.
   - 5 is prime.
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Adds **1** to 5.
   - New total: **6**.
   - 6 is composite.
   - **Player 2 loses**; **Player 1 wins**.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Current Number: 1
Player 1's turn. Add 1 or 2? 1
New Total: 2 (Prime)
---
Current Number: 2
Player 2's turn. Add 1 or 2? 2
New Total: 4 (Composite)
Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Avoid Composite Numbers**: Plan ahead to avoid sequences that force you to announce a composite number.
- **Prime Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with prime numbers within the potential range of totals.
- **Force Opponent's Hand**: Try to set up the current number so that no matter what the opponent adds, they will reach a composite number on their turn.
- **Consider the Sequence**: Be mindful of how your addition affects the subsequent possible totals.
