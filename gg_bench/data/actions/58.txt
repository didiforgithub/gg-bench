In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(max_N + 1)`, meaning actions are integers ranging from `0` to `max_N`, inclusive. However, valid moves correspond only to proper divisors of the current number `N`, which are integers greater than `1` and less than `N` that divide `N` without a remainder. Therefore, while actions can be any number from `0` to `max_N`, only those indices that represent valid divisors of `N` result in legitimate game moves during gameplay. Invalid actions within the range are prohibited, resulting in an end to the game and a penalty.
