In the game environment, the action space indices (0 to 8) correspond to the digits 1 to 9, respectively. Specifically, each action index is incremented by 1 to determine the actual digit a player selects to append to the shared number. For example, action index 0 maps to digit 1, action index 1 maps to digit 2, and so on, up to action index 8 mapping to digit 9.
