In the Capture Relay game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with two possible actions:

- Action index **0**: This corresponds to the "Move Forward" action, where the player's token is moved one node towards the opponent's base.
- Action index **1**: This corresponds to the "Push Back Opponent" action, which is only available when the player's token is adjacent to the opponent's token. This action allows the player to push the opponent's token back by one node.
