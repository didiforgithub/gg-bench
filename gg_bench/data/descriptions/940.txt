# Parity Duel Rule Book

## Objective

Be the player to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. This is achieved by strategically removing numbers from a shared list based on parity rules (odd and even numbers).

## Setup

- **Number List**: A shared list of integers from **1** to **20** is displayed to both players.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

All numbers are initially unclaimed and available for selection.

## Game Components

### Number List

- **Appearance**: Numbers are displayed in ascending order, typically as a simple list:
  ```
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
  ```
- **Functionality**: Numbers are removed from the list as players select them during their turns.
- **Unique Attributes**:
  - Each number has a parity attribute:
    - **Odd Numbers**: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
    - **Even Numbers**: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20

### Player Indicators

- The game keeps track of whose turn it is and displays prompts accordingly.
- Indicators include:
  - **Current Player**: Shows which player is to act.
  - **Last Number Removed**: Displays the last number removed and its parity.

## Turns

### Turn Order

- The game begins with **Player 1**.
- Players alternate turns thereafter.

### Turn Structure

1. **Display**:
   - The available numbers are displayed.
   - Information about the last number removed and its parity is provided.

2. **Action**:
   - The player must select and remove a valid number from the list according to the rules.

3. **Validation**:
   - The game checks if the selected number is valid.
   - If valid, the number is removed.
   - If invalid, the player is prompted to select a valid number.

4. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a valid move, the turn passes to the opponent.

### Valid Moves

- **First Turn (Player 1)**:
  - May select **any** number from the list.

- **Subsequent Turns**:
  - A player's choice is determined by the **parity of the last number** their opponent removed.
    - If the opponent removed an **even** number, the player must remove an **odd** number.
    - If the opponent removed an **odd** number, the player must remove an **even** number.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Removal

- Players remove numbers from the shared list based on the parity rules.

### Parity Rules

- **Opposite Parity Selection**:
  - Players must always select a number of the **opposite parity** to the last number removed by their opponent.

### Valid Move Determination

- A move is valid if:
  - The number selected is of the required parity (opposite to the last number removed by the opponent).
  - The number is still available in the list.

- If no numbers of the required parity are available, the player cannot make a valid move.

### End of Game

- The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- The player who **cannot make a valid move loses** the game.

### No Draws

- The game **cannot end in a draw**; one player must lose when they cannot make a valid move.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move wins.
- **No Points System**: There is no point scoring; victory is determined by achieving the objective.
