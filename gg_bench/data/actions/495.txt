In the game GridLock, the action space indices correspond to the 4x4 grid cells as follows: each index in the action space (0 to 15) maps to cells on the grid using row-major order. Specifically, the action index `a` translates to the cell at row `a // 4` and column `a % 4`. For example, action `0` corresponds to the cell `(0,0)`, action `1` to `(0,1)`, action `4` to `(1,0)`, and so on, up to action `15` which corresponds to cell `(3,3)`. This straightforward mapping allows players to select grid positions directly by their linear indices.
