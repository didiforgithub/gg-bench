In the provided gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 7) map directly to the possible numbers that can be added to the running total in the game. Specifically, each index corresponds to a number between 2 and 9 as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the number 2.
- Index 1 corresponds to the number 3.
- Index 2 corresponds to the number 4.
- Index 3 corresponds to the number 5.
- Index 4 corresponds to the number 6.
- Index 5 corresponds to the number 7.
- Index 6 corresponds to the number 8.
- Index 7 corresponds to the number 9.

This mapping allows players to select an action (index) that translates to adding a specific number from 2 to 9 to the total.
