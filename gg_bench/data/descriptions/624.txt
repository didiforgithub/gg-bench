### **Rules and Mechanics**

#### **Core Rules**

- **Card Placement**:
  - The drawn card must be placed immediately after drawing.
  - Players cannot skip their turn or hold onto cards.
- **Visibility**:
  - All cards in both stacks are visible to both players at all times.
  - The order of cards in the stacks matters for strategic planning.
- **Deck Depletion**:
  - The game continues until all cards have been drawn and placed.
- **Card Effects**:
  - **Number 5 Penalty**:
    - For every **5** in a player's stack, **subtract 5 points** from their total score at the end of the game.

#### **Winning the Game**

- **Scoring**:
  - At the end of the game, each player calculates their score by:
    - **Adding up** all the numbers in their stack.
    - **Subtracting** **5 points** for each **number 5** in their stack.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - The player with the **higher total score** after deductions **wins**.
- **Tie-Breaker**:
  - If scores are equal, the player with **fewer number 5s** in their stack wins.
  - If still tied, proceed to **Sudden Death** (see below).

---

### **Scoring**

- **Total Score Formula**:
  - **Total Score** = (Sum of all numbers in the stack) - (Number of 5s × 5)
- **Example Calculation**:
  - If a player's stack has cards: 7, 5, 3, 9
    - Sum of numbers: 7 + 5 + 3 + 9 = 24
    - Number of 5s: 1
    - Penalty: 1 × 5 = 5
    - **Total Score**: 24 - 5 = 19

### **Game Summary**

Number Stack Battle is a quick and engaging two-player game where strategy and foresight are key. Players must decide each turn whether to boost their own score or hinder their opponent's chances. The inclusion of penalty cards (number 5s) adds a layer of complexity, requiring players to think carefully about the impact of each move. With simple rules and a clear objective, it's easy to learn but offers depth for those seeking a strategic challenge.

Enjoy the battle of numbers, and may the best strategist win!
