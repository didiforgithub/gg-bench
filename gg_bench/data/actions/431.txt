In the given gym environment, the action space indices map to the moves as follows:

- **Actions 0-7:** Each corresponds to flipping a single bit (1 to 8). Action 0 flips bit 1, action 1 flips bit 2, continuing in this manner up to action 7, which flips bit 8.
  
- **Actions 8-14:** Each corresponds to flipping two adjacent bits. Action 8 flips bits 1 and 2, action 9 flips bits 2 and 3, continuing this pattern up to action 14, which flips bits 7 and 8.
