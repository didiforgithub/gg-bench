In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 48, corresponding to choosing numbers from 2 to 50. The action index 0 maps to the number 2, the index 1 to the number 3, and so on, up to index 48, which maps to the number 50. This is achieved by adding 2 to the action index to determine the chosen number. Thus, selecting an action with index `i` results in choosing the number `i + 2` from the pool.
