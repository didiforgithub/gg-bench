In the game environment, each index in the action space corresponds to the position of a digit within the current number that a player can choose to delete. The action space is defined as a discrete space with size equal to the maximum number of digits allowed (`max_num_digits`). When a player selects an action (an index), the digit at that corresponding position in the list of digits is removed. The resulting number must then be checked for divisibility by the divisor, and the game state is updated accordingly. If the deletion results in a valid number, the game continues; otherwise, it indicates an invalid move. Valid moves are determined by the indices of digits whose removal creates a number divisible by the divisor.
