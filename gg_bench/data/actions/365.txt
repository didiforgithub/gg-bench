The action space indices in the game range from 0 to 8 and directly correspond to the grid positions in the 3x3 grid representing the 9 possible cells that can be selected. Each index maps to a cell using a 0-based row-major order, where index 0 represents the top-left cell (grid position 1), index 1 represents the top-middle cell (grid position 2), and so on, ending with index 8, which represents the bottom-right cell (grid position 9). Indices are converted to grid coordinates by dividing the index by 3 to get the row and taking the remainder to determine the column.
