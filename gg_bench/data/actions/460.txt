In the provided gym environment for the game, the action space is represented as a discrete space with indices ranging from `0` to `M-1`, where `M` is the maximum number in the list of available numbers (`1` to `M`). Each index in the action space corresponds directly to these numbers by adding 1 to the index. For example, an action with index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `1`, an action with index `1` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, and so on up to the action with index `M-1` corresponding to selecting the number `M`. This translates the zero-based index of the action space into the actual numbers available for selection in the game.
