In the `Blockade Runner` gym environment, actions in the action space are mapped as follows:

- **Indices 0-3**: Correspond to movement actions:
  - 0: Move up (offset: (-1, 0))
  - 1: Move down (offset: (1, 0))
  - 2: Move left (offset: (0, -1))
  - 3: Move right (offset: (0, 1))

- **Indices 4-28**: Correspond to obstacle placements:
  - For each index `i` from 4 to 28, the action places an obstacle on the grid cell at coordinates `(i - 4)`, derived using:
    - `x = (i - 4) % grid_size`
    - `y = (i - 4) // grid_size`

These indices allow players to control their piece movements or place obstacles strategically within a 5x5 grid, aligning with the constraints and objectives of the game.
