The action space indices (0-19) map to combinations of numbers (1-10) and operations (add, multiply) as follows: odd indices represent multiplying the number, and even indices represent adding the number. Specifically, each pair of consecutive indices corresponds to a particular number, with the first index in the pair denoting addition and the second denoting multiplication. For example, index 0 is (1, add), index 1 is (1, multiply), index 2 is (2, add), index 3 is (2, multiply), and so on up to index 19 (10, multiply).
