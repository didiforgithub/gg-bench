# Digit Drop Duel

## Objective

Be the last player to remove a digit from a shared number without reducing it to zero. The player who removes the last digit and reduces the number to zero **loses** the game.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared multi-digit positive integer. Players agree on the starting number before the game begins.
  - *Example Starting Number*: `123456`

- **Decide Turn Order**: Players determine who goes first, either by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played through a command-line interface where players input their moves and the game displays the current state.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A multi-digit positive integer that both players manipulate during the game.
  - The number changes as digits are removed by the players.

- **Digits (0-9)**: Individual numerals within the shared number that players can remove on their turns.

---

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Current Number Displayed**: The game displays the current shared number.
2. **Player's Move**:
   - The player selects one digit from the current number to remove.
   - They input this digit via the command line.
3. **Update Number**:
   - The game removes the first occurrence of the selected digit from the number.
   - The updated number is displayed.

### Turn Order

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- Play continues until the game ends per the rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Digit Removal**:
   - On their turn, a player must remove **one** digit from the current shared number.
   - The digit can be chosen from any position within the number.
   - Only the **first occurrence** of the chosen digit is removed (leftmost if duplicates exist).
   - **Example**: If the number is `1223` and a player removes `2`, the new number is `123`.

2. **Leading Zeros Not Allowed**:
   - If removing a digit results in leading zeros, those zeros are dropped.
   - **Example**: Removing `1` from `1023` results in `23`, not `023`.

3. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn. A move must be made if possible.

4. **Game End Condition**:
   - The player who reduces the shared number to zero **loses** the game.
   - If a player has no valid moves (the number is already zero), they lose.

5. **Integrity of Number**:
   - After a digit is removed, the remaining digits retain their original order.
   - Digits are not rearranged or shifted.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Duplicate Digits**:
  - If the number contains duplicate digits, only one instance (the first occurrence) is removed per turn unless all digits are the same.
- **Single-Digit Number**:
  - If the current number is a single-digit number greater than zero, the next player must remove that digit, resulting in zero and losing the game.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins by forcing their opponent to reduce the shared number to zero on their turn.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can compete in multiple rounds, keeping score to determine an overall winner.
  - **Point System**:
    - Each game won earns the player one point.
    - The first player to reach a predetermined number of points wins the match.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice will affect the number of digits remaining.
  - Aim to force your opponent into a position where they must remove the last digit.

- **Digit Selection**:
  - Removing certain digits can limit your opponent's options.
  - Focus on removing digits that, if left, could prolong the game in your opponent's favor.

- **Balance the Number**:
  - Avoid leaving the number with an even number of digits when possible, as this can be advantageous.
