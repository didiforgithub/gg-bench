In the custom gym environment for *Number Runner*, the action space indices map to possible player actions as follows:

- **Action 0**: Move the player's piece one position forward toward the opponent's base. For Player 1, this means advancing from a lower to a higher-numbered position, while for Player 2, it means moving from a higher to a lower-numbered position.
- **Actions 1-9**: Place an obstacle at the corresponding position on the board. Action `n` places an obstacle at position `n` (index `n-1` in zero-indexed terms of the array representing the board). Obstacles can be placed on any empty position not currently occupied by a player's piece or another obstacle.
