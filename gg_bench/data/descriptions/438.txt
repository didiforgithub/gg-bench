# Divisor Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where the primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Players take turns reducing a shared number by choosing its proper divisors. The player who reduces the number to 1, leaving the opponent with no valid moves, wins the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer called the **Starting Number**. For a standard game, the Starting Number is **50**, but players can agree on any positive integer.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that both players manipulate during the game. It starts at the Starting Number and decreases as the game progresses.
- **Proper Divisors**: All positive integers that divide N evenly, excluding N itself.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions per Turn**:
  1. **Determine Divisors**: Identify all proper divisors of the current shared number N.
  2. **Choose Divisor**: Select one proper divisor to subtract from N.
  3. **Update N**: Subtract the chosen divisor from N to get the new N.
- The updated N becomes the shared number for the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On their turn, a player **must** choose a proper divisor of N.
   - A proper divisor is any positive integer that divides N evenly, excluding N itself.
2. **Subtracting the Divisor**:
   - The chosen divisor is subtracted from N:  
     New N = Current N - Chosen Divisor
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces N to **1** on their turn, leaving the opponent with no valid moves, that player **wins**.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player has no valid moves (i.e., N is 1 at the start of their turn), they **lose** the game.
5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn; if a valid move exists, they must make one.
6. **No Repetition**:
   - Divisors can be reused in subsequent turns as long as they are valid for the current N.

## Scoring

- This game does not have a point-based scoring system.
- **Victory Condition**: The player who forces the shared number N to 1 on their turn, leaving the opponent without a valid move, wins the game.
- **Loss Condition**: A player loses if they start their turn when N is 1, leaving them with no valid moves.

## Example Gameplay

### Starting the Game

- Starting Number (N): **50**
- Players: **Player 1** and **Player 2**

### Turn-by-Turn Play

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 50
   - **Proper Divisors of 50**: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 25
   - **New N**: 50 - 25 = **25**

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 25
   - **Proper Divisors of 25**: 1, 5
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 5
   - **New N**: 25 - 5 = **20**

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 20
   - **Proper Divisors of 20**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 10
   - **New N**: 20 - 10 = **10**

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 10
   - **Proper Divisors of 10**: 1, 2, 5
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 5
   - **New N**: 10 - 5 = **5**

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 5
   - **Proper Divisors of 5**: 1
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 1
   - **New N**: 5 - 1 = **4**

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 4
   - **Proper Divisors of 4**: 1, 2
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 2
   - **New N**: 4 - 2 = **2**

7. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 2
   - **Proper Divisors of 2**: 1
   - **Chosen Divisor**: 1
   - **New N**: 2 - 1 = **1**

8. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 1
   - **No proper divisors** (since 1 has no divisors other than itself)
   - **Player 2 Cannot Move**: N is 1, so Player 2 loses.
   - **Winner**: **Player 1**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  ```
  Current N: 50
  Proper divisors: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25
  Choose a divisor to subtract from N: 25
  New N is 25
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  ```
  Current N: 25
  Proper divisors: 1, 5
  Choose a divisor to subtract from N: 5
  New N is 20
  ```

*(Subsequent turns follow the same pattern.)*

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the new N you leave them with.
- **Avoid Leaving Low N**: Try not to reduce N to a small number where your opponent can control the endgame.
- **Force the Win**: Aim to reduce N to numbers where the available divisors work in your favor for the next turn.

## Summary

**Divisor Duel** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and manipulate numbers. With straightforward rules and mechanics, it is easy to code and play in a command-line interface. The absence of chance elements ensures that skillful play is rewarded, allowing a proficient player to consistently triumph over a less experienced one. Enjoy the duel of wits and numbers!
