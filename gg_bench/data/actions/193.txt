In the "Range War" game environment, the action space is defined using `spaces.Discrete(10)`, which corresponds to selecting a number from the shared number line of 1 to 10. Each action space index directly maps to a move in the game by adding 1 to the index value. Specifically, action index 0 selects number 1, action index 1 selects number 2, and so on, up to action index 9 selecting number 10. This one-to-one mapping allows players to interact with the number line through action indices ranging from 0 to 9.
