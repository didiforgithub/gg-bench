# Rule Book for "Divisor Duel"

---

## Objective

Be the last player to make a valid move by strategically subtracting proper divisors from a shared number. Win the game by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number (N):**
   - Agree on a positive integer greater than 1 to start the game (e.g., 60).
   - This number will be shared and updated throughout the game.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide which player goes first (Player 1) and which player goes second (Player 2).

3. **No Additional Components:**
   - No physical pieces or boards are required; all interactions occur through the command-line interface.

---

## Game Components

1. **Shared Number (N):**
   - A positive integer that both players interact with during the game.
   - It changes as players subtract divisors from it.

2. **Proper Divisors:**
   - Numbers greater than 1 and less than N that divide N evenly (without leaving a remainder).
   - These are the numbers players can subtract from N on their turn.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

2. **Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Calculate Proper Divisors:**
     - Determine all proper divisors of the current N.
   - **Choose and Subtract a Divisor:**
     - Select one proper divisor and subtract it from N.
     - Update N to the new value (N = N - divisor).
   - **Check for Game End:**
     - If the new N is a prime number or 1, the next player may not have a valid move.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - The updated N becomes the current N for the next player's turn.
   - Play continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must subtract a proper divisor of N (a number greater than 1 and less than N that divides N evenly).
   - You cannot subtract 1 or N itself.

2. **Calculating Proper Divisors:**
   - Proper divisors must satisfy two conditions:
     - Be greater than 1 and less than N.
     - Divide N evenly (N % divisor == 0).

3. **Updating N:**
   - After subtracting the chosen divisor, update N:
     - New N = Current N - Chosen Divisor.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn (because N is 1 or a prime number), you win.

5. **Losing the Game:**
   - You lose if you cannot make a valid move on your turn.

6. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw; there will always be a winner.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome:**
  - The game is won by the last player to make a valid move.
  - There is no point-based scoring; the focus is on strategic play to outmaneuver your opponent.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting N = 60**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Current N: 60
- Proper Divisors of 60: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- Player 1 chooses to subtract **15**.
- New N: 60 - 15 = **45**

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Current N: 45
- Proper Divisors of 45: 3, 5, 9, 15
- Player 2 chooses to subtract **15**.
- New N: 45 - 15 = **30**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Current N: 30
- Proper Divisors of 30: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- Player 1 chooses to subtract **15**.
- New N: 30 - 15 = **15**

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Current N: 15
- Proper Divisors of 15: 3, 5
- Player 2 chooses to subtract **5**.
- New N: 15 - 5 = **10**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Current N: 10
- Proper Divisors of 10: 2, 5
- Player 1 chooses to subtract **5**.
- New N: 10 - 5 = **5**

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Current N: 5
- Proper Divisors of 5: None (5 is a prime number)
- Player 2 cannot make a valid move and loses.

**Result: Player 1 wins the game!**

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

```plaintext
Welcome to Divisor Duel!

Enter the starting number (N > 1): 60

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 60
Proper Divisors of 60: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30]
Enter the divisor to subtract: 15
New N is now 45.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 45
Proper Divisors of 45: [3, 5, 9, 15]
Enter the divisor to subtract: 15
New N is now 30.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 30
Proper Divisors of 30: [2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15]
Enter the divisor to subtract: 15
New N is now 15.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 15
Proper Divisors of 15: [3, 5]
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
New N is now 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 10
Proper Divisors of 10: [2, 5]
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
New N is now 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 5
Proper Divisors of 5: None (5 is a prime number)
No valid moves available. Player 2 loses!

Congratulations, Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate future moves by considering how your current move will affect the set of proper divisors available on your opponent's turn.
- **Force Prime Numbers:** Try to reduce N to a prime number on your opponent's turn, leaving them without a valid move.
- **Subtract Larger Divisors Early:** Reducing N significantly can limit your opponent's options, but be cautious not to set up a prime number on your own turn.
- **Avoid Self-Traps:** Be aware of the divisors remaining after your move to ensure you are not left without options on subsequent turns.

---

## Additional Rules Clarifications

- **Reusing Divisors:** There is no restriction on reusing divisors; the same proper divisor can be used multiple times if it remains a proper divisor of the current N.
- **Invalid Inputs:** If a player attempts to subtract an invalid divisor (e.g., a number that is not a proper divisor of N), they must choose a valid divisor instead.
- **Enforcement:** Players are responsible for ensuring they choose valid proper divisors and update N correctly each turn.
