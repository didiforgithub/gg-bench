# Multiplicity: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

Multiplicity is a strategic two-player game where players take turns selecting numbers from a finite set. The primary goal of the game is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move according to the game's rules. A player wins by choosing numbers that limit their opponent's options, ultimately leaving them unable to continue the sequence.

## Setup

- **Number Set**: The game uses a predefined set of positive integers from **1** to **50**.
- **Starting Number**: The game begins with the current number set to **1**.
- **Unchosen Numbers**: All numbers from **1** to **50** are initially unchosen and available for selection.

## Game Components

- **Players**: Two participants alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Number Pool**: A list of numbers from **1** to **50**.
- **Current Number (`N`)**: The most recently chosen number, starting at **1**.
- **Chosen Numbers**: A record of numbers that have already been selected during gameplay.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first through mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).
- **Action on Turn**:
  - The player must select an **unchosen number** from the number pool.
  - The chosen number must be a **proper multiple or proper divisor** of the current number `N`.
    - A **proper multiple** is a number greater than `N` where the chosen number is divisible by `N` without a remainder.
    - A **proper divisor** is a number less than `N` that divides evenly into `N`.
    - The chosen number **cannot** be equal to `N`.
- **Updating the Current Number**: After a valid selection, the chosen number becomes the new current number `N`.
- **Turn Progression**: Turns alternate between the two players until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On each turn, a player must select an unchosen number from **1** to **50**.
   - The selected number must satisfy one of the following conditions:
     - **Multiple of `N`**: The number is a proper multiple of the current number `N` (chosen number > `N` and divisible by `N`).
     - **Divisor of `N`**: The number is a proper divisor of the current number `N` (chosen number < `N` and `N` divisible by the chosen number).
   - The selected number must **not** have been chosen previously in the game.

2. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Selecting a number that is not a proper multiple or proper divisor of `N`.
   - Choosing a number that has already been selected earlier in the game.
   - Selecting the same number as the current number `N`.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player **loses** if they are unable to make a valid move on their turn.
   - The opposing player is declared the **winner**.

4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move.
   - There are no draws; a winner is always determined.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**:
  - The game result is binary: one player wins, and the other loses.
  - No points are accumulated; only the win/loss outcome is recorded.

- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players may agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of games won by each player to determine an overall winner after a set number of rounds.

## Strategic Depth and Complexity

Multiplicity offers a balance of simplicity and strategic depth. While the rules are straightforward, players must think ahead to avoid leaving their opponent with advantageous moves. Key strategies include:

- **Limiting Opponent's Options**: Choose numbers that reduce the possible valid moves for your opponent.
- **Controlling the Flow**: Select numbers that force the game into sequences where you have the upper hand.
- **Awareness of Remaining Numbers**: Keep track of which numbers have been used to plan future moves.

## Summary

Multiplicity is an engaging game that combines basic mathematical concepts with strategic planning. Its simple rules make it easy to code and play in a command-line interface, while the strategic possibilities ensure that skilled players can consistently outperform unskilled opponents. With no possibility of a draw and a finite number set, games are quick and always conclude with a clear winner.
