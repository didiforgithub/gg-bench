In the gym environment for the Parity Chase game, the action space indices are mapped directly to the numbers 1 through 20 in the number pool. Each action is represented by an index in the action space, which corresponds to a number as follows: action index 0 corresponds to the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on up to action index 19 which corresponds to the number 20. An action's validity depends on whether the corresponding number is still available in the pool and matches the required parity for the current player.
