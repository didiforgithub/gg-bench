The action space in the gym environment is defined as a discrete space with 8 possible actions, corresponding to the multipliers available in the game, which are numbers 2 through 9. Specifically, each action index maps to a multiplier as follows: action 0 corresponds to multiplier 2, action 1 to multiplier 3, and so on, up to action 7 which corresponds to multiplier 9. This mapping allows players to select a multiplier by choosing the respective action index during their turn.
