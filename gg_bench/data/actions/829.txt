In the `CustomEnv` class, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which means each action corresponds to an index representing a number from 1 to 9. The indices range from 0 to 8, with each index `i` mapping directly to the number `i + 1`. For instance, an action with index `0` maps to number `1`, an action with index `1` maps to number `2`, and so on, up to an action with index `8` which maps to number `9`. This mapping allows players to select numbers from the shared list by choosing the corresponding action index in the environment.
