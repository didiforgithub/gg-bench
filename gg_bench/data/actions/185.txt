The action space in the **Equation Duel** gym environment is represented by a single integer that corresponds to a specific move. Each move consists of selecting two numbers and one operation. The mapping works as follows:

1. **Pairs of Numbers**: Every action is derived from selecting a unique ordered pair of numbers, with their indices in the `numbers` array being combined. The possible pairs are given by the list `self.pairs`.

2. **Operations**: For each pair, there are four possible operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). The index of the operation is combined with the pair index to form the unique action index.

3. **Action Index Calculation**:
   - The overall action index is computed as `pair_index * number_of_operations + operation_index`.
   - `pair_index` corresponds to the position of the number pair in `self.pairs`.
   - `operation_index` indicates which of the four operations is applied to the selected pair.

Thus, the action space index is a unique identifier for a combined selection of two different numbers and a single operation to form an equation.
