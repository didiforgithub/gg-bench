In the game, each action is represented by an index in the action space ranging from 0 to 17. This mapping is constructed by pairing the available numbers (1 through 9) with the two possible actions: Attack and Defend.

- **Action indices 0 to 17** are divided into pairs, where each pair corresponds to a number from 1 to 9.
- **Even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 16)** represent the Attack action using numbers 1 to 9, respectively. Specifically, index `2*n` corresponds to attacking with the number `n+1`.
- **Odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., 17)** represent the Defend action using numbers 1 to 9, respectively. Specifically, index `2*n+1` corresponds to defending with the number `n+1`.

For example, action index 0 corresponds to attacking with the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to defending with the number 1, action index 2 corresponds to attacking with the number 2, and so on, up to action index 17, which corresponds to defending with the number 9.
