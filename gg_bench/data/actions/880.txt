The action space in the game is represented by integers from 0 to 19, which correspond to the numbers 1 to 20 on the number list. Each action index directly maps to a number where action 0 refers to number 1, action 1 to number 2, and so on up to action 19 referring to number 20. When a player chooses an action index, the corresponding number is removed from the list according to the game's rules.
