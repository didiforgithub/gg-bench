The action space indices in the CustomEnv are mapped directly to the available multipliers in the game. Specifically, each action, represented as an integer from 0 to 7, corresponds to a multiplier from 2 to 9. The mapping is achieved by taking the action index and adding 2 to it, effectively translating action `0` to multiplier `2`, action `1` to multiplier `3`, and so on, up to action `7` which translates to multiplier `9`. This allows each action to represent a valid move in the game.
