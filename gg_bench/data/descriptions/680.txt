# Bid and Build: A Strategic Two-Player Game

## Objective

Bid and Build is a strategic bidding game where two players compete to construct a tower of blocks. The primary goal is to be the first player to build a tower consisting of **five blocks**. Players must wisely manage their limited resources (points) and anticipate their opponent's moves to achieve victory. A player wins by constructing their fifth block before their opponent does or by outlasting their opponent when they deplete their points.

## Setup

- Each player starts with **10 points**.
- Both players have their own virtual "tower" with zero blocks at the start.
- A coin toss or mutual agreement determines which player takes the first turn.
- The game is played over several bidding rounds until a win condition is met.

## Game Components

- **Points**: Each player has 10 points used for bidding.
- **Blocks**: Represented numerically to indicate the height of each player's tower (0 to 5).
- **Bids**: Secret amounts (integers) chosen by players during each round.
- **Command-Line Interface**: All interactions and inputs are performed via text commands.

## Turns

- The game consists of simultaneous turns called **bidding rounds**.
- In each round:
  - Both players secretly choose a bid (an integer between **0** and the number of points they currently have).
  - Bids are revealed simultaneously.
  - The player with the higher bid wins the round.
- After resolving bids, the game proceeds to the next round unless a win condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Bidding

- **Valid Bids**: A bid must be an integer between **0** and the player's current points.
- **Submitting Bids**: Players privately input their bid using the command-line interface.
- **Revealing Bids**: After both players have submitted their bids, the bids are revealed simultaneously.

### Resolving Bids

- **Higher Bid Wins**: The player with the higher bid wins the round.
- **Adding Blocks**: The winning player adds **one block** to their tower.
- **Deducting Points**: Both players subtract their bids from their points total.
- **Tie Breaker**:
  - If both players bid the same amount, **no blocks are added**, but points are still deducted.
  - In case of a tie, no player wins the round.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Conditions**:
  1. A player builds their tower to a height of **five blocks**.
  2. The opposing player cannot place any further bids because they have **zero points** remaining after a tied bid.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the bidding and win conditions.

### Game End

- The game ends immediately when one of the victory conditions is met.
- The player who meets the victory condition is declared the winner.

## Scoring

- **Points Tracking**: Players keep track of their remaining points throughout the game.
- **Tower Height**: Players track the number of blocks in their tower (0 to 5).
- **Strategy**: Effective management of points and prediction of opponent's bids are crucial for winning.
