In the game environment, each action space index corresponds to a possible proper divisor D of the current number N. Specifically, an action index `a` maps to a divisor `D = a + 2`. This means the action space consists of indices representing integers starting from 2 up to N-1 (potentially). Players select an index `a` which translates to choosing the divisor `D`, used to divide the current number N without a remainder. If the resulting action is invalid (for example, if `D` does not properly divide N or falls outside the valid range), the action results in a penalty and ends the game.
