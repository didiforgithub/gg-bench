In this game, the action space indices represent moves to specific squares on the 5x5 grid. The indices range from 0 to 24, corresponding to each grid square in row-major order. An index `a` maps to grid coordinates `(r, c)` where `r = a // 5` and `c = a % 5`. This means:

- Index 0 corresponds to square A1 (row 0, column 0).
- Index 1 corresponds to square A2 (row 0, column 1).
- Index 2 corresponds to square A3 (row 0, column 2).
- ...
- Index 23 corresponds to square E4 (row 4, column 3).
- Index 24 corresponds to square E5 (row 4, column 4).

This mapping allows players to choose their moves based on single integer actions, which the environment then translates into specific grid positions.
