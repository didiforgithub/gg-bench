The action space indices in the environment range from 0 to the starting number \(N_{\text{start}} = 100\). However, only indices corresponding to the proper divisors of the current \(N\) are valid moves. Each valid index in the range represents a proper divisor that can be chosen during a player's turn to update \(N\). Invalid actions (indices that are not proper divisors) result in a penalty, ending the game with a loss for the current player.
