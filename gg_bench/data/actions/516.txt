In the environment, the action space indices 0 through 7 map to the available multipliers 2 through 9, respectively. This means action index 0 corresponds to multiplying by 2, index 1 to multiplying by 3, and so on, up to index 7, which corresponds to multiplying by 9. This mapping allows players to select their move by choosing an action index which represents their desired multiplier.
