In the gym environment for the Digit Subtractor game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)` which corresponds to valid digits from 1 to 9. The action space indices (0 to 8) are mapped to these digits by adding 1 to the index, i.e., action index 0 maps to digit 1, action index 1 maps to digit 2, and so on, up to action index 8 which maps to digit 9. This mapping allows each action to represent a valid digit that can be subtracted from the current number N.
