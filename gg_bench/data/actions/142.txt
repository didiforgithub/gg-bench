In the gym environment for the game, the action space consists of indices ranging from 0 to 7, each representing a move corresponding to a multiplier between 2 and 9. Specifically, action index 0 maps to a multiplier of 2, index 1 to a multiplier of 3, and so on, up to index 7, which maps to a multiplier of 9. This linear mapping is used to select a multiplier during a player's turn to update the current total.
