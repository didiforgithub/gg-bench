In the provided gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(starting_number + 1)`, meaning it consists of indices from 0 to the starting number (inclusive). However, valid gameplay moves are mapped to indices starting from 1 to `starting_number`, representing the numbers players can subtract. The index `0` does not correspond to any valid move by game rules and is ignored. Specifically, during a player's turn, they select an index that corresponds to the number they wish to subtract from the current number, constrained by the game rules to be either a proper divisor (excluding 1 and the number itself) or 1 if the current number is a prime or 1.
