## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
In **Number Split**, two players compete to avoid being the first unable to make a valid move. The objective is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot perform a move according to the game's rules. A player loses if it is their turn and they cannot make a valid move.

**Victory Condition:**  
- **Win:** You win the game if your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **Loss:** You lose the game if it is your turn and you have no valid moves available.

## Setup

1. **Initial Number Selection:**  
   - The game starts with a single positive integer called the **Initial Number**.
   - For a quick and engaging game, it is recommended to start with an Initial Number between **15** and **31**. For example, **N = 15**.
   - This number is placed in a **Shared List** accessible to both players.

2. **Player Positions:**  
   - **Player 1** and **Player 2** are determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
   - Players will alternate turns throughout the game.

3. **Game Environment:**  
   - The game is played in a command-line interface.
   - Ensure both players can view and interact with the Shared List.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Valid Numbers for Splitting:**  
   - Only numbers **greater than 1** in the Shared List can be selected for splitting.
   - The number **1** is considered unsplittable and cannot be chosen.

2. **Splitting a Number:**  
   - When splitting a number `N`, you must create two positive integers `A` and `B` such that:
     - `A + B = N`
     - `A ≥ 1` and `B ≥ 1`

3. **Updating the Shared List:**  
   - Remove the original number `N` from the list.
   - Add the new numbers `A` and `B` to the list.
   - The order of numbers in the list does not affect gameplay.

4. **No Skipping Turns:**  
   - If a player has at least one valid move, they must make a move.
   - Players cannot pass or skip their turn if a move is available.

### Winning the Game

- **Loss Condition:**  
  - If it is your turn and all numbers in the Shared List are **1**, you have no valid moves and you lose the game.

- **Win Condition:**  
  - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you win the game.

### Additional Mechanics

- **No Resplitting in the Same Turn:**  
  - You cannot split a number that you've just added to the list in the same turn. Splitting only one number per turn is allowed.

- **Command-Line Interaction:**  
  - Players input commands to select and split numbers.
  - The game interface updates the Shared List after each move.
