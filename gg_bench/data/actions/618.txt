In the gym environment for Divisor Duel, the action space is defined as a discrete set of integers from 0 to the maximum possible initial number \( N_{\text{max}} \) (default is 100). Each action corresponds directly to a potential subtraction from the current number \( N \). However, not all actions represent valid moves because they must be valid proper divisors of the current \( N \) (excluding 1 and \( N \) itself). Thus, only those indices in the action space that match the proper divisors can be chosen as valid moves during gameplay. Invalid actions result in termination with a penalty.
