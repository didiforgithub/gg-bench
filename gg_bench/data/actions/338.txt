In the game environment, each action in the discrete action space is mapped to a number choice between 2 and 9. The action space has 8 indices, ranging from 0 to 7. Each index corresponds to a number calculated by adding 2 to the index value. Thus, index 0 represents the number 2, index 1 represents the number 3, and continues up to index 7 representing the number 9. This mapping allows players to select any integer within the valid range (2 to 9) on their turn.
