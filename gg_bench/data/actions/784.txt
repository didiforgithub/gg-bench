In the gym environment for the "Prime Reduction" game, the action space indices correspond to the available prime numbers up to 50. Each index in the action space represents a specific prime number, allowing a player to select an action by subtracting the corresponding prime from their current number. The `self.primes` list stores these primes in ascending order, and the indices relate directly to the position of the prime number in this list. Thus, selecting an action involves mapping the chosen index to the corresponding prime factor in this pre-defined list. This structure enables the players to make legal moves by selecting valid prime factors of their current number.
