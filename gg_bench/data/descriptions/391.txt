# **Game Title: Quantum Duel**

---

## **Objective**

Be the first player to collapse all of your opponent's quantum states by strategically observing and manipulating shared particles, thus achieving a total quantum collapse of their system.

---

## **Setup**

- **Quantum Particles Grid**: A 3x3 grid representing quantum particles shared between the two players.
- **Quantum States**: Each cell in the grid can be in one of two quantum states: *Superposed* `(S)` or *Collapsed* `(C)`.
- **Initial State**: All particles start in the *Superposed* state `(S)`.

---

## **Game Components**

1. **Quantum Grid**:
   - A 3x3 matrix accessible via command-line interface positions:
     ```
     [1][2][3]
     [4][5][6]
     [7][8][9]
     ```
   - Each cell can hold a quantum particle in a specific state.

2. **States**:
   - **Superposed (S)**: The particle is in a potential state and has not been observed.
   - **Collapsed (C)**: The particle has been observed by a player and has taken a definite state.

3. **Player Tokens**:
   - **Player 1**: Represented by `P1`.
   - **Player 2**: Represented by `P2`.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns; determine who goes first randomly or by mutual agreement.

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Observation Phase**:
     - The player selects one *Superposed* particle to observe (collapse).
     - The particle's state changes from `(S)` to `(C)`, and it becomes associated with the observing player (`P1` or `P2`).
   - **Manipulation Phase** (Optional):
     - The player may perform one special action per turn if conditions are met (see **Rules and Mechanics**).

3. **Progression**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player collapses all of the opponent's particles.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Observing Particles**:
   - **Observation**: On your turn, you must observe one *Superposed* particle.
   - **Claiming**: The observed particle is claimed and marked with your player token (`P1` or `P2`).

2. **Superposition Collapse**:
   - Once observed, a particle cannot return to a *Superposed* state.

3. **Adjacency Rule**:
   - **Chain Reaction**: If you observe a particle adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to one or more particles owned by the opponent, those opponent particles become entangled.
   
4. **Entanglement and Collapse**:
   - **Entangled Particles**: An opponent's particle that is adjacent to your newly observed particle becomes entangled.
   - **Collapsing Entangled Particles**:
     - On your next turn, instead of observing a new particle, you may choose to collapse all entangled opponent particles.
     - Collapsed opponent particles are removed from the grid (set to a neutral state `(X)`).

5. **Special Actions**:
   - **Quantum Swap**:
     - Condition: You must have exactly two claimed particles adjacent to a single opponent's particle.
     - Action: Swap the state of one of your adjacent particles with the opponent's particle.
   - **Quantum Tunnel**:
     - Condition: There must be exactly one unclaimed *Superposed* particle between two of your claimed particles.
     - Action: Claim the *Superposed* particle between your particles by tunneling, without using the observation phase.

6. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Victory Condition**: You win if you collapse all of your opponent's particles (i.e., the opponent has no claimed particles left on the grid).

## **Scoring**

- **No Points System**: The game is won by meeting the victory condition, without the need for point tracking.

## **Examples**

### **Example Scenario**

Let's walk through a sample game to illustrate the rules.

#### **Initial Grid**

All particles are in the *Superposed* state `(S)`:

```
[1:S][2:S][3:S]
[4:S][5:S][6:S]
[7:S][8:S][9:S]
```

#### **Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Observation Phase**:
  - Player 1 observes particle at position 5.
  - The grid updates:

```
[1:S][2:S][3:S]
[4:S][5:P1][6:S]
[7:S][8:S][9:S]
```

#### **Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Observation Phase**:
  - Player 2 observes particle at position 2.
  - No adjacent opponent particles, so no entanglement.
  - The grid updates:

```
[1:S][2:P2][3:S]
[4:S][5:P1][6:S]
[7:S][8:S][9:S]
```

#### **Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Observation Phase**:
  - Player 1 observes particle at position 6.
  - It's adjacent to Player 2's particle at position 2.
  - Player 2's particle at position 2 becomes entangled.
  - The grid updates:

```
[1:S][2:P2*][3:S]
[4:S][5:P1][6:P1]
[7:S][8:S][9:S]
```
- (`P2*` denotes an entangled particle)

#### **Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Collapse Option**:
  - Player 2 could choose to collapse their entangled particle but decides to observe instead.
- **Observation Phase**:
  - Observes particle at position 8.
  - The grid updates:

```
[1:S][2:P2*][3:S]
[4:S][5:P1][6:P1]
[7:S][8:P2][9:S]
```

#### **Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Collapse Option**:
  - Player 1 chooses to collapse the entangled opponent particle at position 2.
  - Particle at position 2 is removed (set to neutral `(X)`).
  - The grid updates:

```
[1:S][2:X][3:S]
[4:S][5:P1][6:P1]
[7:S][8:P2][9:S]
```

#### **Turn 6: Player 2**

- **Observation Phase**:
  - Observes particle at position 9.
  - No adjacent opponent particles.
  - The grid updates:

```
[1:S][2:X][3:S]
[4:S][5:P1][6:P1]
[7:S][8:P2][9:P2]
```

#### **Game Continues...**

Players continue to take turns according to the rules until one player collapses all opponent particles.

## **Strategic Depth**

- **Entanglement Management**: Deciding when to entangle opponent particles or when to collapse them adds a layer of strategy.
- **Special Actions Utilization**: Timing the use of Quantum Swap and Quantum Tunnel can turn the tide of the game.
- **Positional Advantage**: Claiming particles that maximize your control while minimizing risk.
- **Prediction**: Anticipating the opponent's moves based on the current grid state.
