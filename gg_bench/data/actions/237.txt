In the "Sequence Duel" game environment, each action corresponds to selecting a number from 1 to 9. The action space indices (0-8) map directly to these numbers by adding 1 to the index. Thus, index 0 corresponds to the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, and so on up to index 8, which corresponds to the number 9. This allows players to choose numbers from the shared pool by selecting the appropriate index in the action space.
