# Order Challenge

## Objective

In **Order Challenge**, two players compete to build the longest strictly increasing sequence of numbers by selecting from a shared pool of integers. The primary goal is to continue adding numbers to your sequence without breaking the increasing order. The player who cannot make a valid move loses, and the opponent wins.

---

## Setup

- **Shared Number Pool**: A set of unique integers from **1** to **9** inclusive.
- **Player Sequences**: Each player starts with an empty sequence.

At the start of the game:

1. Place all numbers from **1** to **9** into the shared number pool.
2. Decide which player will take the first turn (you may flip a coin or decide amicably).

---

## Game Components

### Shared Number Pool

- **Numbers**: Integers **1** through **9**.
- **Availability**: Each number is available to both players but can be selected only once.
- **Function**: Serves as the source from which players draw numbers to build their sequences.

### Player Sequences

- **Individual Sequences**: Each player maintains their own sequence of numbers.
- **Starting Condition**: Both sequences start empty.
- **Structure**: Numbers are added to the end of the sequence in the order they are selected.

---

## Turns

Players alternate turns throughout the game.

### Turn Structure

1. **Selection Phase**:
   - The active player selects one available number from the shared pool.
2. **Validation Phase**:
   - The selected number must be **strictly greater** than the last number in the player's own sequence.
   - If the player's sequence is empty, any available number may be selected.
3. **Update Phase**:
   - Add the selected number to the end of the player's sequence.
   - Remove the selected number from the shared pool.
4. **Turn End**:
   - The turn passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection

- **Initial Selection**:
  - If your sequence is empty, you may choose any number from the shared pool.
- **Subsequent Selections**:
  - You must choose a number that is **strictly greater** than the last number in your sequence.
  - If no such number exists in the shared pool, you cannot make a valid move.

### 2. Sequence Building

- **Strictly Increasing Order**:
  - Your sequence must always increase; equal or smaller numbers cannot be added after larger ones.
- **Sequence Example**:
  - Valid: [2, 5, 6]
  - Invalid: [3, 3], [4, 2]

### 3. Shared Pool Management

- **Number Availability**:
  - Once a number is selected, it is removed from the shared pool and cannot be selected again.
- **Viewing the Pool**:
  - Players should always be informed of the current numbers available in the shared pool at the start of their turn.

### 4. Winning the Game

- **Loss Condition**:
  - If it's your turn and you cannot select any valid number, you lose.
- **Win Condition**:
  - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you win.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player loses.

---

## Scoring

- **Outcome**:
  - The game results in a win for one player and a loss for the other.
- **No Point System**:
  - There are no points awarded; the focus is on strategic play to outlast the opponent.
- **Match Play**:
  - Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Look at the shared pool and anticipate future moves. Try to force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.
- **Control High Numbers**: Securing higher numbers can limit your opponent's options later in the game.
- **Balance Selections**: Avoid selecting numbers too high too soon, as this may reduce your own options in later turns.
- **Monitor Opponent's Sequence**: Keep track of your opponent's sequence to predict their possible moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.
