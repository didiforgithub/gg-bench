In the game, the action space indices 0, 1, and 2 map to moves of 1, 2, and 3 spaces forward, respectively. This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index, so index 0 corresponds to moving 1 space (0 + 1 = 1), index 1 corresponds to moving 2 spaces (1 + 1 = 2), and index 2 corresponds to moving 3 spaces (2 + 1 = 3).
