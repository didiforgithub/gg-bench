# Digit Deletion Duel

---

## Objective

Be the **first player** to reduce the shared number to a **single-digit number** (1-9) during your turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Choose a starting number that is a positive integer with at least **two digits**. A six-digit number like **123456** is recommended for standard play.
2. **Player Roles**: Two players agree on who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
3. **First Move**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by mutual agreement or a random method).

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: The current number that players manipulate during the game. It is visible to both players throughout the game.
- **Digits (0-9)**: Numerals that make up the shared number.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Display Current Number**: The shared number is displayed to the current player.
2. **Action Phase**: The player chooses **one digit** from the current number to delete.
3. **Validation Phase**:
   - Ensure the new number is a valid positive integer.
   - The new number **must not** have any leading zeros.
4. **Update Phase**: The shared number is updated to the new number after the deletion.
5. **Check for Win**: If the new number is a **single-digit number** (1-9), the current player **wins**.
6. **End Turn**: If no win condition is met, the turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Deleting Digits**:
   - On each turn, a player **must** delete **exactly one digit** from the current shared number.
   - The digit can be in any position within the number.

2. **Valid Numbers**:
   - After deletion, the resulting number must be a valid positive integer.
   - **Leading zeros are not allowed**. For example, deleting the first digit '1' from **10345** to create **0345** is invalid.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces the shared number to a **single-digit number** (between 1 and 9) on their turn, they **win the game**.

4. **Losing Condition**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., the current number is already a single-digit number at the **start** of their turn), they **lose the game**.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players **must** make a move on their turn if possible.

6. **Shared Number Integrity**:
   - The shared number is always updated after each turn and is used for the next player's turn.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who reduces the number to a single-digit number on their turn wins the game.
- **Match Play**: Players may opt for multiple games, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.
