In the gym environment for the game, actions are represented by indices from 0 to 8 in the action space. Each index corresponds to placing a number on the stack. Specifically, index 0 maps to placing the number 1, index 1 maps to placing the number 2, and so on up to index 8, which maps to placing the number 9. Thus, the actions are offset by 1, such that action `a` corresponds to placing the number `a + 1` onto the stack.
