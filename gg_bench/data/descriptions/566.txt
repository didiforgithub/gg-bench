## Strategy Tips

- **Balance Attacking and Recharging:** Constant Attacks will deplete your EP quickly. Remember to Recharge to keep enough EP for future actions.
- **Use Defend Wisely:** Anticipate your opponent's Attacks. Using Defend right before an expected Attack can significantly reduce damage.
- **Monitor Opponent's EP:** Keep track of the opponent's EP to predict their possible actions. For example, if they have low EP, they may be forced to Recharge.
- **Plan Ahead:** Consider the EP costs of your actions to avoid being left without enough EP to Attack or Defend when needed.

By carefully choosing when to Attack, Defend, or Recharge, and by anticipating your opponent's moves, you can outmaneuver them and claim victory.
