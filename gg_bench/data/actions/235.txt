In the "Quantum Leap" gym environment, the action space indices map to moves in the game as follows:

- The action space consists of 21 discrete actions, indexed from 0 to 20.
- Each action index `i` corresponds to moving forward by `i + 1` cells.
- This mapping means that an action index `i` translates to a move forward by `i + 1` cells on the grid.
- For example, action index `0` represents moving forward by 1 cell, action index `1` represents moving forward by 2 cells, and so on, up to action index `20`, which represents moving forward by 21 cells.
