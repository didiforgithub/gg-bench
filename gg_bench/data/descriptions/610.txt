# Line Duel

## Objective

In **Line Duel**, your goal is to strategically push a shared marker along a number line toward your opponent's end. You win the game by moving the marker to your opponent's endpoint through clever use of your move cards while anticipating your opponent's moves.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Line Initialization**:
   - Draw or represent a number line ranging from **-5** to **+5**, with **0** as the center point.
   - The number line should include all integers within this range:

     ```
     -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5
     ```

2. **Marker Placement**:
   - Place a shared marker (could be any token or symbol) at position **0** on the number line.

3. **Move Cards Distribution**:
   - Each player receives a set of **five move cards**, numbered **1** through **5**.
   - The move cards represent the power of your moves.
   - Cards are held privately in each player's hand.

4. **Player Roles**:
   - **Player 1** aims to push the marker towards the positive end (**+5**).
   - **Player 2** aims to push the marker towards the negative end (**-5**).

## Game Components

1. **Number Line**:
   - A linear representation with positions from **-5** to **+5**.
   - Serves as the battlefield where the marker moves back and forth.

2. **Marker**:
   - A shared token that moves along the number line based on the players' moves.
   - Indicates the current state of the game.

3. **Move Cards**:
   - Each player has an identical set of move cards:

     - **Cards**: Numbers **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**.
     - **Function**: Determines the strength of a player's push in a round.
     - **Usage**: Once a move card is played, it is discarded and cannot be used again.

---

## Turns

1. **Round Structure**:
   - The game proceeds in a series of rounds.
   - Each round consists of both players performing actions simultaneously.

2. **Player Actions per Round**:
   - **Select a Move Card**:
     - Secretly choose one unused move card from your hand.
     - This selection should be concealed from your opponent until both players are ready to reveal.

   - **Reveal Move Cards**:
     - Both players simultaneously reveal their chosen move cards.
     - This ensures that selections are made without knowledge of the opponent's current move.

   - **Calculate Movement**:
     - Determine the **Net Movement** by comparing the move cards (details in Rules and Mechanics).
     - Move the marker accordingly on the number line.

   - **Discard Used Cards**:
     - Place the used move card face-up in a discard pile.
     - It cannot be used again for the remainder of the game.

3. **Progression**:
   - Repeat the round structure until a win condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Calculation

1. **Net Movement Determination**:
   - **Compare Move Cards**:
     - Identify the higher and lower move cards played.
   - **Calculate Net Movement**:
     - **Net Movement** = Higher Move Card - Lower Move Card.
   - **Direction of Movement**:
     - If **Player 1** played the higher card, the marker moves towards the positive end (**+5**).
     - If **Player 2** played the higher card, the marker moves towards the negative end (**-5**).
     - If both players played the same card, the Net Movement is **0**, and the marker does not move.

2. **Marker Movement**:
   - Move the marker along the number line according to the Net Movement and direction.
   - The marker cannot move beyond the endpoints. If movement would take it past **+5** or **-5**, it stops at the endpoint.

### Winning Conditions

1. **Immediate Win**:
   - **Endpoint Reach**:
     - If the marker reaches your opponent's endpoint (**Player 1** reaching **+5**, **Player 2** reaching **-5**), you win the game immediately.

2. **All Move Cards Used**:
   - If all move cards have been played and no player has reached the opponent's endpoint, determine the winner as follows:

     - **Marker Position**:
       - If the marker is on the positive side (**positions +1 to +5**), **Player 1** wins.
       - If the marker is on the negative side (**positions -1 to -5**), **Player 2** wins.
       - If the marker is at position **0**, proceed to the tiebreaker.

   - **Tiebreaker for Position 0**:
     - The player who last moved the marker **toward their opponent's end** wins.
     - If the marker has not moved from position 0 throughout the game, **Player 2** wins (since **Player 1** moves first, this balances first-mover advantage).

### Additional Rules

1. **Simultaneous Action**:
   - All move selections are made without knowledge of the opponent's current choice.
   - Encourages strategic thinking and prediction.

2. **No Reuse of Move Cards**:
   - Once a move card is used, it is out of play.
   - Players must plan their use of high and low cards carefully.

3. **Command-Line Interface Adaptation**:
   - Inputs can be made via text commands representing the chosen move card.
   - The game state (number line and marker position) is displayed after each round.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**:
  - Try to predict which move card your opponent might play.
  - Use higher cards when you expect your opponent to play a high card if you need to prevent them from gaining an advantage.

- **Manage Your Move Cards**:
  - Balance the use of high and low cards.
  - Saving high cards for crucial moments can be a winning strategy.

- **Consider the Marker Position**:
  - Be aware of the marker's current location.
  - If the marker is close to your end, prioritize moves to push it back.

- **Plan for the Endgame**:
  - Remember that if all cards are used, the marker's position determines the winner.
  - Aim to have the marker on your opponent's side as move cards run out.
