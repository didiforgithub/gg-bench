**Game Name:** Power Play

---

## Objective

The objective of **Power Play** is to force your opponent to exceed a cumulative total of **100**. Players take turns multiplying a shared cumulative total by a number between **2** and **9**. The player whose move causes the cumulative total to exceed **100** loses the game.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Total:** The game begins with a cumulative total of **1**.
- **Players:** Two players participate, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Turn Order:** Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Total:** A single integer value shared between players, starting at **1**.
- **Allowed Multipliers:** Integers from **2** to **9**, inclusive.
- **Command-Line Interface:** The game is played entirely through a command-line interface where players input their chosen multipliers.

---

## Turns

1. **Player Input:** On their turn, a player chooses a multiplier between **2** and **9**.
2. **Update Total:** The chosen multiplier is used to multiply the current cumulative total.
3. **Announce Total:** The new cumulative total is announced.
4. **Check for Loss:** If the cumulative total exceeds **100**, the player who made the move loses.
5. **Turn Progression:** If the cumulative total is **100** or less, the turn passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing a Multiplier:**
   - Players must select an integer multiplier between **2** and **9**, inclusive.
   - Input must be a whole number within the allowed range.

2. **Multiplying the Total:**
   - The current cumulative total is multiplied by the chosen multiplier.
   - Example: If the current total is **5** and the player chooses **3**, the new total is **5 Ã— 3 = 15**.

3. **Exceeding 100:**
   - If after multiplication, the cumulative total is greater than **100**, the player who made the move loses the game.
   - If the cumulative total equals exactly **100**, the game continues, and the next player takes their turn.

4. **Invalid Input:**
   - If a player inputs an invalid multiplier (not an integer between **2** and **9**), they are prompted again.
   - Repeated invalid inputs may result in a penalty or forfeit, as agreed upon before the game.

5. **Strategic Depth:**
   - Players must plan ahead to avoid forcing themselves into a position where they have no safe moves.
   - Anticipating the opponent's potential moves is key to victory.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The player who forces their opponent to exceed the cumulative total of **100** wins the game.
- **Losing the Game:**
  - If a player's move causes the cumulative total to exceed **100**, they lose the game.
- **No Draws:**
  - The game cannot end in a draw; it will always conclude with a win or loss.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting the Game:**

- The cumulative total is **1**.
- **Player 1** decides to go first.

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Current Total:** 1
- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Chooses multiplier **5**.
- **Calculation:**
  - \(1 \times 5 = 5\)
- **New Total:** 5
- **Announcement:**
  - "Player 1 multiplied by 5. New total is 5."

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current Total:** 5
- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Chooses multiplier **8**.
- **Calculation:**
  - \(5 \times 8 = 40\)
- **New Total:** 40
- **Announcement:**
  - "Player 2 multiplied by 8. New total is 40."

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current Total:** 40
- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Chooses multiplier **2**.
- **Calculation:**
  - \(40 \times 2 = 80\)
- **New Total:** 80
- **Announcement:**
  - "Player 1 multiplied by 2. New total is 80."

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current Total:** 80
- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Chooses multiplier **2**.
- **Calculation:**
  - \(80 \times 2 = 160\)
- **New Total:** 160
- **Announcement:**
  - "Player 2 multiplied by 2. New total is 160."
- **Result:**
  - The cumulative total exceeds 100.
  - **Player 2 loses the game.**
- **Winner:**
  - **Player 1 wins!**

---

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead:**
  - Players should calculate potential future totals to avoid setting up their own loss.
- **Example Strategy:**
  - If the current total is **14**, and you notice that multiplying by any number will set up the opponent to force a loss, choose the multiplier that minimizes your risk.

---

**Command-Line Interaction Example:**

```plaintext
Starting the game. The total is 1.
Player 1, choose a multiplier (2-9): 5
Player 1 multiplied by 5. New total is 5.
Player 2, choose a multiplier (2-9): 8
Player 2 multiplied by 8. New total is 40.
Player 1, choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
Player 1 multiplied by 2. New total is 80.
Player 2, choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
Player 2 multiplied by 2. New total is 160.
Total exceeds 100! Player 2 loses.
Player 1 wins the game!
```
