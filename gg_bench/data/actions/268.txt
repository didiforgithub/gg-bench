The action space indices in the game environment range from 0 to 8, representing the action of selecting an element from the available pool. The indices map directly to the sorted order of the elements currently available in the pool. When a player chooses an action with a certain index, it corresponds to selecting the element in that position from the sorted list of available elements. This mechanism ensures players can choose elements based on the current state of the pool without index ambiguity.
