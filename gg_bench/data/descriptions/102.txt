# Double or Nothing

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly 10 points** by strategically choosing to either add to or multiply your current score without exceeding the target score.

## Setup

- **Target Score**: 10 points.
- **Starting Score**: Both players begin with 0 points.
- **Player Order**: Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a coin toss.
  
No physical components are needed; players track scores mentally or write them down. The game is played in a command-line interface where players enter their choices each turn.

## Game Components

- **Player Scores**: Numerical values starting at 0 for each player.
- **Actions**: On each turn, players choose one of the following actions:
  - `Add 1`: Increment your current score by 1 point.
  - `Double`: Multiply your current score by 2.
  
These actions allow players to strategically increase their scores to reach the target.

## Turns

- Players take **alternate turns** starting with the first player.
- On their turn, a player must choose one of the two actions:
  - **Add 1** to their current score.
  - **Double** their current score.
- After performing the action, the player's new score is updated.
- The game continues with turns alternating between players.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing Actions**:
   - **Add 1**:
     - Increases the player's score by 1 point.
   - **Double**:
     - Multiplies the player's current score by 2.
     - If doubling would result in a score **exceeding 10**, this action is **not allowed**, and the player must choose `Add 1` instead.
     
2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach **exactly 10 points** wins the game.
   
3. **Exceeding the Target Score**:
   - Players **cannot** perform an action that would cause their score to exceed 10.
   - If both actions would cause the player's score to exceed 10, the player **loses their turn**, and play passes to the opponent.
   
4. **No Further Moves**:
   - If **both players** are unable to make a valid move on their respective turns (i.e., any action would exceed 10), the **player whose turn it is next loses the game**. This ensures the game cannot end in a draw.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: Achieve a score of exactly 10 points.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use a point-based scoring system beyond reaching the target score.
- **Victory**: Declared when a player reaches 10 points.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Scores**:
- Player A: 0 points
- Player B: 0 points

#### Turn 1:
- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Add 1`.
  - New score: 0 + 1 = **1**
  
#### Turn 2:
- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Double`.
  - New score: 0 * 2 = **0** (Doubling zero remains zero)
  
#### Turn 3:
- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Double`.
  - New score: 1 * 2 = **2**
  
#### Turn 4:
- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Add 1`.
  - New score: 0 + 1 = **1**
  
#### Turn 5:
- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Double`.
  - New score: 2 * 2 = **4**
  
#### Turn 6:
- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Double`.
  - New score: 1 * 2 = **2**
  
#### Turn 7:
- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Double`.
  - New score: 4 * 2 = **8**
  
#### Turn 8:
- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Add 1`.
  - New score: 2 + 1 = **3**
  
#### Turn 9:
- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Cannot `Double` (8 * 2 = 16 exceeds 10)
  - Chooses to `Add 1`.
  - New score: 8 + 1 = **9**
  
#### Turn 10:
- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Chooses to `Double`.
  - New score: 3 * 2 = **6**
  
#### Turn 11:
- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Cannot `Double` (9 * 2 = 18 exceeds 10)
  - Chooses to `Add 1`.
  - New score: 9 + 1 = **10**
  - **Player A wins!**

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Players should anticipate future moves to avoid being unable to act.
- **Balancing Actions**: Deciding when to `Double` for rapid progress and when to `Add 1` to avoid overshooting the target is crucial.
- **Forcing Opponent's Hand**: Players can make moves that limit the opponent's options on their next turn.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Here is how the game might look in a command-line interface:

```
Game Start! Target Score: 10
Player A's Turn:
- Current Score: 0
Choose your action: (1) Add 1 or (2) Double
> 1
Player A adds 1. New Score: 1

Player B's Turn:
- Current Score: 0
Choose your action: (1) Add 1 or (2) Double
> 2
Player B doubles their score. New Score: 0

Player A's Turn:
- Current Score: 1
Choose your action: (1) Add 1 or (2) Double
> 2
Player A doubles their score. New Score: 2

Player B's Turn:
- Current Score: 0
Choose your action: (1) Add 1 or (2) Double
> 1
Player B adds 1. New Score: 1

... [Game continues as in the example above] ...

Player A's Turn:
- Current Score: 9
Choose your action: (1) Add 1 or (2) Double
> 1
Player A adds 1. New Score: 10
Congratulations, Player A! You reached 10 and won the game!
```

## Conclusion

**Double or Nothing** is a simple yet strategic game that involves mathematical planning and foresight. It is easy to learn and quick to play, making it ideal for a command-line interface. Players must carefully choose when to `Add 1` or `Double` their score to reach the target before their opponent.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
