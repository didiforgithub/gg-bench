In the game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space of size 19, corresponding to the numbers 2 through 20 inclusive. Each index in the action space maps to a specific number in this range, where index 0 corresponds to the number 2, index 1 corresponds to the number 3, and so on, up to index 18, which corresponds to the number 20. When a player selects an action, they are effectively choosing the number from the number pool that is associated with the chosen index.
