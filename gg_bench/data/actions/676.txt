The action space indices in the gym environment correspond directly to the chosen proper divisors in the game. Each index represents a possible action where the action index is the integer value of a proper divisor selected by the player to reduce the current number **N**. The index must be greater than 1 and less than the current **N**, satisfying the conditions of a proper divisor: dividing **N** exactly without a remainder. Thus, a valid action is an index that represents a proper divisor which, when subtracted from **N**, leaves the opponent in the next game state.
