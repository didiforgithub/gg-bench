In the game environment, the action space is represented by six discrete actions, indexed from 0 to 5. The mapping is as follows:

- **Indices 0-4** correspond to attack moves with values ranging from 1 to 5. Specifically, action index `n` translates to an attack move with a value of `n + 1`.
- **Index 5** represents the defend action, which allows a player to restore 1 Shield Point (SP) to themselves, capped at 10 SP.
