# Number Sequence Duel

## Objective

**Number Sequence Duel** is a two-player turn-based strategy game. The primary goal is to be the first player to form an arithmetic sequence of four numbers within your collection. An arithmetic sequence is a set of numbers where the difference between consecutive numbers is consistent (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 9 with a common difference of +2). Victory is achieved immediately upon forming such a sequence.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization:**
   - The game uses numbers from **1 to 20**.
   - All numbers are initially unclaimed and available in a shared pool.

2. **Player Assignment:**
   - Two players are required: **Player A** and **Player B**.
   - Determine who takes the first turn (e.g., coin toss, random selection).

3. **Empty Collections:**
   - Each player starts with an empty collection to hold their claimed numbers.

## Game Components

1. **Number Pool:**
   - A list of integers from **1 to 20**.
   - Represents the shared pool of available numbers.

2. **Player Collections:**
   - **Player A’s Collection:** Holds numbers claimed by Player A.
   - **Player B’s Collection:** Holds numbers claimed by Player B.

3. **Game Interface (Command-Line):**
   - Players interact with the game via a command-line interface.
   - Prompts display available numbers and accept player input.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - **Player A** takes the first turn if designated to start.

2. **Turn Structure:**
   - **Display Available Numbers:** The game shows the current unclaimed numbers.
   - **Player Selection:** The active player selects one number from the available pool.
   - **Update Collections:** The selected number is added to the player’s collection and removed from the pool.
   - **Sequence Check:** After each turn, the player’s collection is checked for an arithmetic sequence of four numbers.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - The next player's turn begins after the current player completes their selection and sequence check.
   - The game continues in this alternating fashion until a player wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection

- On your turn, you **must** select one unclaimed number from the shared pool.
- Input the chosen number when prompted.
- If an invalid or already claimed number is selected, you will be prompted to choose again.

### Forming an Arithmetic Sequence

- **Objective:** Collect numbers that form an arithmetic sequence of **exactly four numbers**.
- **Definition of Arithmetic Sequence:**
  - A sequence where the **difference between consecutive numbers is constant**.
  - Common differences can be positive or negative.
  - Example sequences:
    - Positive difference: 4, 7, 10, 13 (common difference of +3)
    - Negative difference: 15, 12, 9, 6 (common difference of -3)
- **Sequence Formation Rules:**
  - The numbers in your collection can be arranged in any order to form a sequence.
  - Only your own collected numbers are considered for your sequence.
  - You cannot use unclaimed numbers or numbers from your opponent's collection.

### Winning the Game

- The game is won by the first player who successfully forms a valid arithmetic sequence of four numbers within their collection.
- The win is declared immediately after forming the sequence on your turn.
- If no player can form a sequence because all numbers have been claimed, the game acknowledges no possible winner (though this scenario is highly unlikely given the game design).

### Strategic Blocking

- Players can select numbers to **block** their opponent from forming their sequence.
- Pay attention to your opponent's collected numbers to anticipate and prevent their winning moves.

## Scoring

- **No Point System:** The game does not track points.
- **Win Condition:** Victory is solely based on forming the required arithmetic sequence.
- **Instant Win:** As soon as a player forms the sequence, they win the game.
