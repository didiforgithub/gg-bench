The action space indices in the gym environment map directly to number tokens in the game as follows: index 0 corresponds to placing the number 1 on the stack, index 1 corresponds to placing the number 2, and so on, up to index 5, which corresponds to placing the number 6. This direct mapping means each action index (0 to 5) is incremented by 1 to determine the actual number token placed on the stack.
