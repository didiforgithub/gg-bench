In the game's action space, each action corresponds to selecting a square on the 4x4 grid. The action space is a discrete space with 16 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 15. These indices map directly to the grid positions by treating the board as a single linear array:

- Index 0: (1,1)
- Index 1: (1,2)
- Index 2: (1,3)
- Index 3: (1,4)
- Index 4: (2,1)
- Index 5: (2,2)
- Index 6: (2,3)
- Index 7: (2,4)
- Index 8: (3,1)
- Index 9: (3,2)
- Index 10: (3,3)
- Index 11: (3,4)
- Index 12: (4,1)
- Index 13: (4,2)
- Index 14: (4,3)
- Index 15: (4,4)

This linear mapping allows actions to directly correspond to specific squares on the grid, facilitating the conversion between array indices and grid coordinates for gameplay operations.
