The action space indices in the game map from 0 to 24, representing the 25 possible coordinates on the 5x5 grid. Each index corresponds to a specific coordinate `(x, y)` as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to coordinate `(1,1)`.
- Index 1 corresponds to coordinate `(2,1)`.
- Index 2 corresponds to coordinate `(3,1)`.
- Index 3 corresponds to coordinate `(4,1)`.
- Index 4 corresponds to coordinate `(5,1)`.
- Index 5 corresponds to coordinate `(1,2)`.
- And so on, until...
- Index 24, which corresponds to coordinate `(5,5)`.

Each index increases as you move right across a row, and then starts from the leftmost column in the next higher row upward until the topmost row (`y=5`).
