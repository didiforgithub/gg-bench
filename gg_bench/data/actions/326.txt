In the CustomEnv gym environment for the Palindrome War game, actions are represented by discrete indices in the action space. Each action index corresponds to two components: a letter choice and a position choice:

1. **Letter Choice**: The action space has 52 actions (26 letters Ã— 2 positions). The index `letter_index` can be derived using integer division of the action index by 2 (`action // 2`). This maps the action index to a specific letter, where 0 maps to 'a', 1 maps to 'b', and so on up to 25, which maps to 'z'.

2. **Position Choice**: The position to add the letter is determined by the remainder of the action index when divided by 2 (`action % 2`). An even result (0) means the letter is added to the beginning of the sequence, while an odd result (1) means it is added to the end.

Thus, each possible action is a unique combination of a letter and its insertion position in the sequence.
