# Bit Battle Rule Book

## Objective

**Bit Battle** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to manipulate a shared 4-bit binary number so that its decimal equivalent is a multiple of 5. The player who achieves this wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
2. **Initial State**: A shared 4-bit binary number initialized to `0000`.
3. **Turn Order**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by a coin toss). Players then alternate turns.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Binary Number**:
  - A 4-bit number represented as `b3 b2 b1 b0`, where each `b` is a bit that can be `0` or `1`.
  - **Bit Positions**: From left to right, the bits are in positions 3 to 0.
  - **Initial Value**: All bits start at `0`, so the initial binary number is `0000`.

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Players interact with the game by inputting commands to flip bits.
  - The game displays the current state of the binary number after each turn.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Bit Selection**:
   - On your turn, choose one bit in the shared binary number that is currently set to `0`.
   - Bits are identified by their positions (3, 2, 1, 0).

2. **Action**:
   - Flip the selected bit from `0` to `1`.
   - You cannot flip a bit that is already set to `1`.

3. **Result Evaluation**:
   - After flipping the bit, the binary number is converted to its decimal equivalent.
   - Check if the decimal number is a multiple of 5.

4. **Turn Progression**:
   - If the decimal number is not a multiple of 5, the turn passes to the other player.
   - If the decimal number is a multiple of 5, the player who made the move wins the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Bit Flipping**:
   - You must flip exactly one bit from `0` to `1` on your turn.
   - Bits remain `1` once flipped; you cannot flip a bit back to `0`.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Immediate Win**: If after your move the decimal equivalent is divisible by 5, you win.
   - **Forced Loss**: If you have no valid moves on your turn (no bits set to `0`), you lose, and your opponent wins.

3. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. With only four bits and mandatory moves, a winner will always be determined.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Attempting to flip a bit that is already `1` is invalid.
   - If an invalid move is made, the player must choose a valid move instead.

## Scoring

- **Winning**:
  - The winner is the player who first creates a binary number that is a multiple of 5 after flipping a bit on their turn.
  - Alternatively, if a player cannot make a valid move, they lose, and the other player wins.

- **Losing**:
  - The player who fails to create a multiple of 5 and has no bits left to flip on their turn loses.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Gameplay

**Initial State**: `0000` (Decimal 0)

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Flips bit at position 2.
- **Binary Number**: `0100` (Decimal 4)
- **Result**: 4 is not divisible by 5.

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Flips bit at position 3.
- **Binary Number**: `1100` (Decimal 12)
- **Result**: 12 is not divisible by 5.

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Flips bit at position 0.
- **Binary Number**: `1101` (Decimal 13)
- **Result**: 13 is not divisible by 5.

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action**: Flips bit at position 1.
- **Binary Number**: `1111` (Decimal 15)
- **Result**: 15 is divisible by 5.

**Outcome**: Player 2 wins.

### Example 2: Strategic Play

**Initial State**: `0000` (Decimal 0)

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Flips bit at position 0.
- **Binary Number**: `0001` (Decimal 1)
- **Result**: 1 is not divisible by 5.

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Flips bit at position 2.
- **Binary Number**: `0101` (Decimal 5)
- **Result**: 5 is divisible by 5.

**Outcome**: Player 2 wins.

**Explanation**: Player 2 saw an opportunity to create a multiple of 5 by flipping bit 2, resulting in a decimal value of 5.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Current Binary Number: 0000 (Decimal 0)

Player 1's turn.
Available bits to flip: 3, 2, 1, 0
Enter bit position to flip: 1

Binary Number after Player 1's move: 0010 (Decimal 2)
2 is not divisible by 5.

---

Player 2's turn.
Available bits to flip: 3, 2, 0
Enter bit position to flip: 3

Binary Number after Player 2's move: 1010 (Decimal 10)
10 is divisible by 5.

Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the decimal value after each possible move and anticipate your opponent's options.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into a position where they cannot avoid setting up a win for you.
- **Binary to Decimal Conversion**:
  - Understand how flipping certain bits affects the decimal value.
  - Bit positions represent the following decimal values:
    - Position 3: 8
    - Position 2: 4
    - Position 1: 2
    - Position 0: 1
- **Key Decimal Targets**: Aim for intermediate decimal values that give you a winning opportunity on your next turn.
