2. **Defense Phase**:
   - The opposing player (**Defender**) may choose one card from their hand to play face-up in defense.
   - **Note**: Defending is optional. The Defender may choose not to play a card, resulting in full damage from the attack.
3. **Resolution Phase**:
   - Compare the Attacker's and Defender's cards to determine the outcome.
4. **Draw Phase**:

## Rules and Mechanics

### Attack and Defense

- **Attacker**:
  - Selects one card from their hand to attack.
  - The card represents the **Attack Value**.
- **Defender**:
  - May choose to defend by playing one card from their hand.
  - The card represents the **Defense Value**.

### Damage Calculation

- **If the Defense Value is less than the Attack Value**:
  - The **Damage Dealt** is calculated as `Attack Value - Defense Value`.
  - The Damage Dealt is subtracted from the Defender's HP.
- **If the Defense Value is equal to or greater than the Attack Value**:
  - No damage is dealt.
  - **Successful Block**: The Defender negates the attack.

### Card Use and Discarding

- **Used Cards**:
  - After the attack is resolved, both the Attacker's and Defender's cards used in the turn are placed face-up in their respective **Discard Piles**.
- **Hand Replenishment**:
  - At the end of each turn, both players draw enough cards from their decks to have **5 cards** in hand.
- **Deck Depletion**:
  - If a player's deck runs out of cards, shuffle the Discard Pile to form a new deck.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - Reduce the opponent's HP to **0** or below.
- **Losing Condition**:
  - If a player's HP drops to **0** or below, they lose immediately.

### Additional Rules

- **No Passing**:
  - The Attacker must play a card each turn.
- **Optional Defense**:
  - The Defender may choose not to defend against an attack.
- **Tied Attack and Defense Values**:
  - If the Defense Value equals the Attack Value, the attack is fully blocked.
- **Face-Up Play**:
  - All cards are played face-up during the Play and Defense phases.
- **Information Visibility**:
  - Players should be aware of the cards in their Discard Piles but not in their opponent's hand or deck.

## Scoring

- **Health Points (HP)**:
  - Each player starts with **20 HP**.
  - Keep track of HP using a counter or a simple notation.
- **Damage Tracking**:
