In the custom gym environment for the "Number Chain Duel" game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which corresponds to the numbers 1 through 9. An action `a` taken by a player maps to the selection of the number `a + 1` from the number pool. Therefore, action `0` corresponds to choosing the number `1`, action `1` to choosing `2`, and so forth up to action `8`, which corresponds to choosing the number `9`. This mapping is necessary because the action space uses 0-based indexing while the game numbers are 1-based.
