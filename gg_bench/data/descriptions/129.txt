# GridLock Duel

## Objective

Be the last player able to place a marker on the grid. Strategically position your markers to limit your opponent's options while maximizing your own. Force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move to win the game.

## Setup

- **Grid:** A 4x4 grid consisting of 16 cells numbered from 1 to 16.
- **Players:** Two players, each with a unique marker.
  - **Player 1:** Uses marker `'X'`.
  - **Player 2:** Uses marker `'O'`.
- **Starting Conditions:** The grid is empty at the beginning of the game.

## Game Components

### Grid

- **Structure:** A square grid of 4 rows and 4 columns.
- **Cells:** Each cell is identified by a unique number from 1 to 16.
- **Representation:**

  ```
   1 |  2 |  3 |  4
  ---+----+----+---
   5 |  6 |  7 |  8
  ---+----+----+---
   9 | 10 | 11 | 12
  ---+----+----+---
  13 | 14 | 15 | 16
  ```

### Markers

- **Appearance:**
  - Player 1's marker: `'X'`
  - Player 2's marker: `'O'`
- **Functionality:** Used to claim cells on the grid according to the game's placement rules.
- **Attributes:** Unlimited supply for each player.

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Actions on a Turn:**
  - **Placement:** Place your marker on an empty cell following the placement rules.
- **Turn Progression:**
  - A valid move must be made on each turn if possible.
  - If a player cannot make a valid move, the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Placement Rules

1. **Valid Cells:**
   - You may place your marker on any empty cell **not adjacent** to any of your own markers.
   - **Adjacency:** Includes all eight surrounding cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
2. **Invalid Moves:**
   - You cannot place a marker on a cell if any adjacent cell contains your marker.
   - If no valid moves are available, you lose the game.

### Game Progression

- Players take turns placing their markers according to the placement rules.
- The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:** The opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **Loss Condition:** You have no valid moves available on your turn.
- **Outcome:** The last player able to place a marker wins the game.

## Scoring

- **Single Game:** The winner is the player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **Match Play:** Keep track of wins over multiple games to determine an overall champion.
  - Optionally, assign 1 point per win.
  - The player with the most points after a set number of games wins the match.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Consider the grid several moves in advance to avoid trapping yourself.
- **Control the Center:** Placing markers in central locations can limit your opponent's options more effectively.
- **Avoid Isolation:** Try not to isolate your markers, as this can reduce your own future moves.
- **Force Moves:** Encourage your opponent to make moves that open up opportunities for you.
