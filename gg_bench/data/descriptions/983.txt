# Attack and Defend

## Objective

Be the first player to eliminate all of your opponent's soldiers. Use strategy to decide when to attack with your stronger or weaker soldiers. The game cannot end in a draw; one player will always emerge victorious. A skilled player can consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent through strategic choices.

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players participate in the game, referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.
2. **Soldiers**: Each player starts with a set of five soldiers, numbered from **1** to **5**.
3. **Initial State**: All soldiers are available at the start of the game. Soldiers are unique and can be used only once.

## Game Components

- **Soldier Numbers**: The soldiers are represented by their numbers (**1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**).
- **Soldier Pool**: Each player has their own pool of soldiers.
- **Eliminated Soldiers**: A record of soldiers that have been removed from play.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, with Player 1 starting the game.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  - **Select an Attacking Soldier**: Choose one available soldier from your pool.
  - **Declare an Attack**: Announce the number of your attacking soldier.
  - **Select Opponent's Soldier**: Target one of your opponent's available soldiers by number.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Attacking**:
   - On your turn, you must attack using one of your available soldiers.
   - You cannot skip your turn or pass.

2. **Resolving an Attack**:
   - Compare the numbers of the attacking soldier and the defending soldier.
     - **Attacker's Number Higher**: The defending soldier is eliminated and removed from the opponent's pool.
     - **Numbers Equal**: Both soldiers are eliminated and removed from their respective pools.
     - **Attacker's Number Lower**: The attacking soldier is eliminated and removed from your pool.

3. **Soldier Usage**:
   - Once a soldier has been used in an attack (whether it wins, loses, or ties), it is removed from the game.
   - Soldiers cannot be reused in subsequent turns.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - You win if your opponent has no soldiers left in their pool at the start of their turn.
   - If both players lose their last soldiers in the same battle, the attacking player loses the game.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: Eliminate all of your opponent's soldiers.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use points; winning is based on the elimination of opponent's soldiers.
- **Tracking**: Keep track of available and eliminated soldiers for both players throughout the game.
