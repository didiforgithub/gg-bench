# Number Ninjas

## Objective

Become the ultimate Number Ninja by strategically reducing your opponent's Health Points (HP) to **zero** before they do the same to you. Utilize numbers to inflict damage, with opportunities for powerful strikes when timing and number choices align perfectly.

## Setup

- **Health Points**: Both players start with **100 HP**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers from **1 to 10** are available for selection each turn.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by agreement or random selection).

## Game Components

- **Players**: Two participants acting as rival Number Ninjas.
- **Health Tracker**: A display or record of each player's current HP.
- **Number Pool**: Integers from **1** to **10**, inclusive.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Number Selection**: The active player selects an integer **N** where **1 ≤ N ≤ 10**.
2. **Attack Resolution**:
   - Check if **N** divides evenly into the opponent's current HP **before** the attack.
   - Calculate damage based on the **Rules and Mechanics**.
3. **Update HP**: Subtract the calculated damage from the opponent's HP.
4. **Check for Victory**: If the opponent's HP is **zero** or less, the game ends.
5. **Next Turn**: The opposing player becomes the active player.

### Example Turn

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Player 1 chooses **N = 5**.
  - Opponent's HP is **100**, and **5** divides evenly into **100**.
  - Damage is **2 × 5 = 10**.
  - Opponent's HP is updated to **90**.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection

- On your turn, select any integer **N** where **1 ≤ N ≤ 10**.
- You may choose the same number multiple times during the game.

### 2. Damage Calculation

- **Standard Attack**: If **N** does **not** divide evenly into the opponent's current HP **before** the attack, you deal **damage equal to N**.
- **Critical Strike**: If **N** **does** divide evenly into the opponent's current HP **before** the attack, you deal **damage equal to 2 × N** (double damage).

### 3. Updating Health Points

- Subtract the calculated damage from the opponent's current HP.
- If the opponent's HP drops to **zero** or below, they are defeated.

### 4. Winning the Game

- The first player to reduce their opponent's HP to **zero** or below **wins** the game.
- There are **no draws**; the game continues until a player wins.

## Scoring

- **Health Points (HP)**: The vital statistic representing each player's life total.
- **Damage Dealt**: The amount subtracted from the opponent's HP during your turn.
- **Critical Strikes**: Special attacks that deal double damage when conditions are met.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Attack

- **Player 1's HP**: 100
- **Player 2's HP**: 100
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses **N = 7**.
  - **7** does **not** divide evenly into **Player 2's HP (100)**.
  - Damage dealt: **7**.
  - **Player 2's HP** is updated to **93**.

### Example 2: Critical Strike

- **Player 2's HP**: 93
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses **N = 3**.
  - **3** divides evenly into **93**.
  - Damage dealt: **2 × 3 = 6**.
  - **Player 2's HP** is updated to **87**.

### Example 3: Strategy in Action

- **Player 1's HP**: 50
- **Player 2's HP**: 20
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses **N = 5**.
  - **5** divides evenly into **Player 1's HP (50)**.
  - Damage dealt: **2 × 5 = 10**.
  - **Player 1's HP** is updated to **40**.
  - *Player 2 aims for numbers that are factors of Player 1's HP to maximize damage.*

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

```
[Turn 1] Player 1's HP: 100 | Player 2's HP: 100
Player 1, choose a number (1-10): 7
7 does not divide evenly into 100.
You deal 7 damage to Player 2.
Player 2's HP is now 93.

[Turn 2] Player 1's HP: 100 | Player 2's HP: 93
Player 2, choose a number (1-10): 9
9 does not divide evenly into 100.
You deal 9 damage to Player 1.
Player 1's HP is now 91.

[Turn 3] Player 1's HP: 91 | Player 2's HP: 93
Player 1, choose a number (1-10): 7
7 divides evenly into 91.
Critical Strike! You deal 14 damage to Player 2.
Player 2's HP is now 79.
```

## Additional Rules

- **Invalid Input**: If a player selects a number outside the 1-10 range, prompt them to choose a valid number.
- **Negative HP**: If a player's HP drops below zero, consider it as zero for game-ending purposes.
- **No Healing**: There are no mechanisms for restoring HP.
- **Conceding**: A player may concede at any time, resulting in a loss.

## Strategic Tips

- **Monitor Opponent's HP**: Choose numbers that are factors of their HP to maximize damage.
- **Avoid Predictability**: Vary your number choices to keep your opponent guessing.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate how your choices affect future turns and potential critical strikes.
- **Defensive Play**: Sometimes selecting numbers that prevent your HP from being divisible by common numbers can reduce the risk of receiving a critical strike.
