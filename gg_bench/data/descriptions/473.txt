**Game Name:** Multiplier

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to reach or exceed the **Target Number** by successively multiplying the current number by integers between **2** and **9**. Strategic planning and foresight will lead you to victory.

---

**Setup:**

- **Target Number (N):** Agree on a target number to reach or exceed to win the game (e.g., 100).
- **Starting Number:** The game begins with a **Current Number** of **1**.
- **Player Order:** Decide who goes first (e.g., by a coin toss).

---

**Game Components:**

- **Current Number:** The number that gets updated each turn. It starts at **1**.
- **Multipliers:** Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive. These are the numbers players can choose to multiply the Current Number.
- **Target Number (N):** The predefined number that players aim to reach or exceed (e.g., 100).

---

**Turns:**

1. **Player Action:**
   - On your turn, select a **Multiplier** (an integer between **2** and **9**).
   - Multiply the **Current Number** by your chosen Multiplier.
   - Update the **Current Number** with the new value.

2. **Turn Progression:**
   - After updating the Current Number, the turn passes to the other player.
   - The game continues with players alternating turns.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Valid Multipliers:**
   - You must choose a Multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - Choosing an invalid Multiplier results in loss of turn or forfeiture (at the opponent's discretion).

2. **Updating the Current Number:**
   - The Current Number is updated by multiplying it with the chosen Multiplier.
   - Example: If the Current Number is **5** and you choose **3**, the new Current Number is **15**.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player whose move results in the Current Number being **greater than or equal to the Target Number** wins the game.
   - Reaching exactly the Target Number is not necessary; exceeding it also results in a win.

4. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players must take their turn; skipping is not allowed.

5. **End of Game:**
   - Once the game ends, players may choose to play again with the same or a different Target Number.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Victory:** The player who reaches or exceeds the Target Number first wins the game.
- **No Point System:** There is no point accumulation; each game results in a win or loss.

**Examples:**

### Example Game 1:

**Target Number:** 100  
**Player 1:** Alice  
**Player 2:** Bob  

---

**Turn 1:**

- **Current Number:** 1
- **Alice's Turn:**
  - Chooses Multiplier **5**.
  - Current Number is updated: `1 x 5 = 5`.

**Turn 2:**

- **Current Number:** 5
- **Bob's Turn:**
  - Chooses Multiplier **9**.
  - Current Number is updated: `5 x 9 = 45`.

**Turn 3:**

- **Current Number:** 45
- **Alice's Turn:**
  - Chooses Multiplier **2**.
  - Current Number is updated: `45 x 2 = 90`.

**Turn 4:**

- **Current Number:** 90
- **Bob's Turn:**
  - Chooses Multiplier **2**.
  - Current Number is updated: `90 x 2 = 180`.
  - **Bob wins!** Current Number `180` is greater than Target Number `100`.

---

### Example Game 2:

**Target Number:** 200  
**Player 1:** Sarah  
**Player 2:** Michael  

---

**Turn 1:**

- **Current Number:** 1

**Turn 2:**

- **Current Number:** 9
- **Michael's Turn:**
  - Chooses Multiplier **9**.
  - Current Number is updated: `9 x 9 = 81`.

**Turn 3:**

- **Current Number:** 81
- **Sarah's Turn:**

**Strategy Tips:**

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate possible outcomes based on your Multiplier choices and the Current Number.
- **Control the Growth:** Use lower Multipliers to avoid giving your opponent an easy win, especially when the Current Number is close to the Target Number.
- **Force Your Opponent's Hand:** Maneuver the Current Number so that any Multiplier your opponent chooses on their next turn will cause you to win in the subsequent turn.
- **Memorize Key Numbers:** Be aware of critical Current Numbers where certain Multipliers can decisively change the game's outcome.
