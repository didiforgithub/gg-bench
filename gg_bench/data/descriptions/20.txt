# **Prime Connection**

## **Objective**

Prime Connection is a two-player turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the last player to make a valid move according to the game's rules. Players select numbers from a common pool, strategically forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid selection on their turn, thus achieving victory.

## **Setup**

1. **Number Pool Initialization**: The game starts with a common pool of numbers ranging from **1 to 50**.
2. **Determine First Player**: Players decide who will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or a random selection method.
3. **Empty Selection List**: Both players start with no numbers selected.

## **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**: A list of numbers from **1 to 50** available for selection. Numbers are removed from this pool once selected.
- **Player Selections**: Each player maintains a list of numbers they have selected during the game.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players interact with the game by entering commands or selections into the command line.

## **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the first player determined during setup.
- **Player Actions on Their Turn**:
  1. **View Available Numbers**: Players can view the current number pool.
  2. **Select a Number**: Choose a valid number from the pool according to the rules.
- **Turn Progression**: After a player makes a valid selection, the turn passes to the opponent.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Turn**:
   - The first player may select **any number** from the number pool.
2. **Subsequent Turns**:
   - On your turn, you **must select a number** from the pool that **shares a common factor greater than 1** with the **last number selected by your opponent**.
3. **Number Selection**:
   - **Valid Selection**: A number is valid if it meets the criteria above and is still available in the number pool.
   - **Invalid Selection**: If no valid numbers are available, the player cannot make a move and loses the game.
4. **Number Removal**:
   - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the number pool for the remainder of the game.
5. **Endgame Condition**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, resulting in a **loss** for that player and a **win** for the opponent.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**: The winner is the player who successfully forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move according to the game's rules.
- **No Points System**: There is no points or scoring system; victory is determined solely by the above condition.

## **Examples**

### **Sample Game Play**

#### **Game Start**

- **Number Pool**: 1 to 50

#### **Player 1's Turn**

- **Action**: Selects **15** (since it's the first turn, any number is valid).
- **Number Pool**: Numbers 1-50 excluding **15**.

#### **Player 2's Turn**

- **Last Number Selected by Opponent**: **15**
- **Valid Numbers**: Must share a common factor greater than 1 with **15**.
  - Factors of 15: **3**, **5**
  - Eligible Numbers: Any remaining numbers divisible by **3** or **5**.
    - Examples: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 42, 45, 48, 50
- **Action**: Selects **10**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers 1-50 excluding **15** and **10**.

#### **Player 1's Turn**

- **Last Number Selected by Opponent**: **10**
- **Valid Numbers**: Must share a common factor greater than 1 with **10**.
  - Factors of 10: **2**, **5**
  - Eligible Numbers: Remaining numbers divisible by **2** or **5**.
    - Examples: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50
- **Action**: Selects **25**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers 1-50 excluding **15**, **10**, and **25**.

#### **Player 2's Turn**

- **Last Number Selected by Opponent**: **25**
- **Valid Numbers**: Must share a common factor greater than 1 with **25**.
  - Factors of 25: **5**
  - Eligible Numbers: Remaining numbers divisible by **5**.
    - Examples: 5, 20, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50
- **Action**: Selects **30**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers 1-50 excluding **15**, **10**, **25**, and **30**.

#### **Game Progression**

- Players continue in this manner, selecting valid numbers based on the last number chosen by their opponent.
- The pool of available numbers diminishes, and strategic selections become crucial.

#### **Endgame Scenario**

Suppose later in the game:

- **Player 1's Turn**
  - **Last Number Selected by Opponent**: **49**
  - **Factors of 49**: **7**
  - Eligible Numbers: Remaining numbers divisible by **7**.
    - Examples (assuming they are still available): 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42
  - **Action**: Selects **42**.
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - **Last Number Selected by Opponent**: **42**
  - **Factors of 42**: **2**, **3**, **7**
  - Eligible Numbers: Remaining numbers divisible by **2**, **3**, or **7**.
    - If no such numbers are left, Player 2 **cannot make a valid move** and **loses** the game.
