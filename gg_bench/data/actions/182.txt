In the game, each action space index corresponds directly to numbers in the sequence starting from 1. Specifically, the action space ranges from 0 to N-1, where each index represents selecting the number that is one more than the index. For instance, an action space index of 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, an index of 1 to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to N-1, which corresponds to selecting the number N.
