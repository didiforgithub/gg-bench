# **Restricted Removal** â€” Rule Book

## **Objective**

**Be the player to remove the last available number from the list.**

In **Restricted Removal**, two players strategically remove numbers from a shared list. Each move affects which numbers remain available, as removing a number locks out certain other numbers based on specified rules. The primary goal is to be the player who removes the last remaining number, thus securing victory.

## **Setup**

1. **Initialize the Game List**: Create a list of consecutive integers starting from **2** up to a chosen maximum number **N**. For a quick game, it's recommended to set **N = 10**. The initial game list will be:

   ```
   [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   ```

2. **Determine Player Order**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by any random method such as a coin toss.

## **Game Components**

- **Game List**: A shared list containing consecutive integers from **2** to **N**.
- **Locked Numbers**: Numbers that become unavailable for removal due to the game rules. They are not removed from the list but are marked as locked.
- **Players**: Two participants who will take turns removing numbers from the game list.

## **Turns**

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- On each turn, a player performs the following actions:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose one available (unlocked) number from the game list to remove.
  2. **Lock Affected Numbers**: Following the selection, identify and lock all numbers that are multiples or factors of the removed number (excluding the removed number itself).
  3. **End Turn**: The turn ends after removing the chosen number and locking the affected numbers.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Removing Numbers**:
   - On your turn, you **must** remove **one** available number from the game list.
   - The chosen number must be **unlocked** (i.e., not previously removed or locked).

2. **Locking Mechanism**:
   - After removing a number, **immediately lock** all numbers in the game list that are either:
     - **Multiples** of the removed number.
     - **Factors** of the removed number.
   - **Exclusion**: Do not lock the number you just removed.
   - Locked numbers cannot be removed in subsequent turns.

3. **Available Numbers**:
   - Only numbers that are **unlocked** are available for removal.
   - Players must choose from the current list of available numbers on their turn.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who removes the **last available number** from the game list **wins** the game.
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn (i.e., no available numbers remain), they **lose** the game.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**: There is no point scoring system. The game is won by the player who removes the last available number according to the game rules.
- **Game Outcome**:
  - **Winner**: The player who successfully removes the last number.
  - **Loser**: The player who has no available numbers to remove on their turn.
