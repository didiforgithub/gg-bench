The action space is a single integer in the range [0, 24], representing the 25 cells on a 5x5 grid. Each action corresponds to a cell, and the mapping is done row-wise. The index is divided by 5 to determine the row and its remainder gives the column. For example, an action of 0 maps to cell (0, 0), an action of 6 maps to cell (1, 1), and an action of 24 maps to cell (4, 4). Thus, action indices directly map to the grid cells in this row-major order.
