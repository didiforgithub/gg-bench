The action space indices from 0 to 19 correspond to decrementing the counters. Indices 0 to 9 represent decrementing Counter A by amounts from 1 to 10, respectively. Indices 10 to 19 represent decrementing Counter B by amounts from 1 to 10. The mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the index for Counter A decrements and subtracting 9 from the index for Counter B decrements to determine the decrement amount.
