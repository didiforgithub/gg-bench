The action space indices in the provided environment map directly to potential moves in the game by representing divisors of the current score. Each index in the action space, which ranges from 0 to 9, corresponds to the respective divisor from 1 to 10. For example, an action index of 0 represents a move where the divisor 1 is subtracted from the current score, while an action index of 9 represents subtracting the divisor 10. This mapping is used to select valid moves based on whether the chosen divisor divides the player's current score without a remainder.
