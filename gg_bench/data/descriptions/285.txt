# Split and Choose

## Objective

Be the player to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move, thereby winning the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Agree on an initial positive integer called the *Current Number* (e.g., 20). This number should be significantly larger than 1 to allow for strategic play.
2. **First Player**: Decide who will take the first turn. Players can flip a coin or agree between themselves.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: The shared positive integer that changes throughout the game based on players' actions.
- **No Physical Components Required**: The game is played entirely through command-line inputs and outputs, tracking the Current Number.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Split Phase (Active Player)**:
   - The active player splits the *Current Number* into two smaller positive integers that sum up to the *Current Number*.
2. **Choose Phase (Opponent)**:
   - The opponent selects one of the two numbers resulting from the split to become the new *Current Number*.

### Order of Actions

- Players alternate turns, each performing the Split Phase when it is their turn and the Choose Phase when it is their opponent's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Splitting the Current Number**:
   - The active player must **split** the *Current Number* into two **positive integers**, both less than the *Current Number*, whose sum equals the *Current Number*.
   - Example: If the *Current Number* is 10, valid splits include (9,1), (8,2), (7,3), (6,4), and (5,5).

2. **Choosing the New Current Number**:
   - The opponent selects one of the two numbers provided.
   - The selected number becomes the new *Current Number* for the next turn.

3. **Invalid Moves and Losing Condition**:
   - If a player is faced with a *Current Number* of **1** during their Split Phase, they cannot make a valid split (since 1 cannot be split into positive integers greater than zero that sum to 1).
   - The player unable to make a valid split on their turn **loses** the game.

4. **Gameplay Continuation**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns, following the Split and Choose phases, until one player cannot make a valid move and thus loses.

## Scoring

- The game is a **win/loss** format with no point scoring system.
- **Victory Condition**: Force your opponent into a position where they must split a *Current Number* of 1, which is impossible, resulting in their loss.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Initial Setup:**

- *Current Number*: 15
- **Player 1** and **Player 2** agree that **Player 1** will start.

**Turn 1**

- **Player 1's Split Phase**:
  - Splits 15 into **9** and **6**.
- **Player 2's Choose Phase**:
  - Chooses **6**.
- *New Current Number*: 6

---

**Turn 2**

- **Player 2's Split Phase**:
  - Splits 6 into **4** and **2**.
- **Player 1's Choose Phase**:
  - Chooses **2**.
- *New Current Number*: 2

---

**Turn 3**

- **Player 1's Split Phase**:
  - Splits 2 into **1** and **1**.
- **Player 2's Choose Phase**:
  - Chooses **1**.
- *New Current Number*: 1

---

**Turn 4**

- **Player 2's Split Phase**:
  - Cannot split 1 (no valid moves).
- **Player 2** loses the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample interaction illustrating how the game might proceed in a command-line interface:

```plaintext
Game Start!
Starting Number: 20
Player 1 will begin.

---------------------------
Player 1's Turn
Current Number: 20
Enter your split (e.g., '12 8'): 12 8

Player 2, choose a number:
1. 12
2. 8
Enter choice (1 or 2): 2

Player 2 selected 8.
New Current Number is 8.

---------------------------
Player 2's Turn
Current Number: 8
Enter your split (e.g., '5 3'): 5 3

Player 1, choose a number:
1. 5
2. 3
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1

Player 1 selected 5.
New Current Number is 5.

---------------------------
Player 1's Turn
Current Number: 5
Enter your split (e.g., '2 3'): 2 3

Player 2, choose a number:
1. 2
2. 3
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1

Player 2 selected 2.
New Current Number is 2.

---------------------------
Player 2's Turn
Current Number: 2
Enter your split (e.g., '1 1'): 1 1

Player 1, choose a number:
1. 1
2. 1
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1

Player 1 selected 1.
New Current Number is 1.

---------------------------
Player 1's Turn
Current Number: 1
No valid splits possible.
Player 1 loses the game.
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Force Key Numbers**: Aim to leave your opponent with a *Current Number* that is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8), which can be advantageous.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the possible splits and choices your opponent can make to guide the game toward a favorable outcome.
- **Balance Splits**: Sometimes offering two uneven options forces your opponent into a difficult decision.

## Conclusion

"Split and Choose" is a simple yet strategically rich game that challenges players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's moves. Its minimalistic design makes it perfect for command-line play and easy to code, ensuring quick and decisive gameplay where skill prevails over chance.
