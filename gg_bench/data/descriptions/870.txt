# Number Circle

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the **Target Number** exactly by strategically adding or subtracting numbers on a circular number line. The primary goal is to navigate through numbers and operations to land precisely on the Target Number, thereby securing a win.

## Setup

1. **Target Number**: Determine a Target Number between 10 and 20 (e.g., 15).
2. **Number Circle**: Create a circular number line consisting of numbers from 1 to 9 arranged in a circle.
3. **Starting Position**: Both players start at number **1**.
4. **Player Roles**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2).

## Game Components

- **Number Circle**: A circle of numbers from **1** to **9**, in sequential order.
    ```
    9
    / \
    8   2
    |     |
    7   3
    \ /
     6---4 
        |
        5
    ```
- **Player Markers**: Each player has a marker indicating their current position on the Number Circle (both start at **1**).
- **Operations**: Players can perform **addition (+)** or **subtraction (-)** with the numbers on the circle.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
    1. **Movement**: Move your marker to an adjacent number on the Number Circle (numbers are connected sequentially in the circle, and 9 connects back to 1).
    2. **Operation**: Choose to either **add** or **subtract** the number you land on from your **Current Total**.
- **Order of Play**: Players alternate turns starting from Player 1.
- **Current Total**: Begins at **0** for both players and is updated each turn based on their operations.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
    - You may move to any **adjacent number** (numbers directly connected on the circle).
    - Only one move per turn.
2. **Operation Rules**:
    - After moving, you must choose to **add** or **subtract** the number you land on to your Current Total.
    - The operation is mandatory and cannot be skipped.
3. **Landing on the Same Number**:
    - Both players can occupy the same number without any penalty.
4. **Winning the Game**:
    - The first player to make their Current Total exactly equal to the Target Number wins.
5. **Overshooting the Target**:
    - If a move would result in a Current Total exceeding the Target Number, the player cannot perform that operation and must choose the alternative operation or a different move.
6. **No Backtracking**:
    - You cannot return to the number you occupied in your immediate previous turn.

## Scoring

- **Winning Condition**: Achieve a Current Total exactly equal to the Target Number.
- **Losing Condition**: If you cannot make any valid moves without overshooting the Target Number, you lose your turn (but not the game).
- **No Draws**: The game continues until one player reaches the Target Number.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Setup**:
- Target Number: **15**
- Both players start with Current Total **0** at number **1**.

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1** moves to number **2**.
- Chooses to **add 2**.
- Current Total: **0 + 2 = 2**.

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 2** moves to number **9** (adjacent to 1).
- Chooses to **add 9**.
- Current Total: **0 + 9 = 9**.

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1** moves to number **3**.
- Chooses to **add 3**.
- Current Total: **2 + 3 = 5**.

**Turn 4**:
- **Player 2** moves to number **8**.
- Chooses to **add 8**.
- Anticipates exceeding the Target Number (**9 + 8 = 17**, which is over 15).
- Chooses to **subtract 8** instead.
- Current Total: **9 - 8 = 1**.

**Turn 5**:
- **Player 1** moves to number **4**.
- Chooses to **add 4**.
- Current Total: **5 + 4 = 9**.

**Turn 6**:
- **Player 2** moves to number **7**.
- Chooses to **add 7**.
- Current Total: **1 + 7 = 8**.

**Turn 7**:
- **Player 1** moves to number **5**.
- Chooses to **add 5**.
- Current Total: **9 + 5 = 14**.

**Turn 8**:
- **Player 2** moves to number **6**.
- Cannot **add 6** (would be **8 + 6 = 14**, acceptable).
- Chooses to **add 6**.
- Current Total: **8 + 6 = 14**.

**Turn 9**:
- **Player 1** moves to number **6**.
- Cannot **add 6** (would be **14 + 6 = 20**, exceeds 15).
- Chooses to **subtract 6**.
- Current Total: **14 - 6 = 8**.

**Turn 10**:
- **Player 2** cannot return to number **6** (was just there).
- Moves to number **5**.
- Chooses to **add 5**.
- Current Total: **14 + 5 = 19**, exceeds Target Number.
- Must choose to **subtract 5**.
- Current Total: **14 - 5 = 9**.

**Turn 11**:
- **Player 1** moves to number **7**.
- Chooses to **add 7**.
- Current Total: **8 + 7 = 15**.
- **Player 1 wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Total: 2
  Available Moves: 2 <-> 3
  Choose your move: Move to 3
  Choose operation (+/-): +
  You added 3. New Total: 5
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Total: 9
  Available Moves: 9 <-> 8
  Choose your move: Move to 8
  Choose operation (+/-): -
  You subtracted 8. New Total: 1
  ```

- **Player 1's Winning Move**:
  ```
  Current Total: 8
  Available Moves: 6, 7
  Choose your move: Move to 7
  Choose operation (+/-): +
  You added 7. New Total: 15
  Congratulations! You reached the Target Number. You win!
  ```

## Summary

- **Strategic Depth**: Players must plan moves ahead, considering both the numbers they land on and the operations, while also anticipating the opponent's potential moves.
- **No Draws**: The game is designed to always have a winner.
- **Simple to Code**: The game mechanics are straightforward, suitable for a command-line interface.
- **Skill-Based Outcome**: Players with better strategic planning are more likely to win.
