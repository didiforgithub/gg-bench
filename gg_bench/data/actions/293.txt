In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for the Factor Frenzy game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.N)`, where `N` is the maximum number in the number pool. The action space indices range from `0` to `N-1`, and each action index corresponds to selecting the number `index + 1` from the pool. This mapping accounts for the fact that array indexing in Python starts at `0`, while the numbers in the game start at `1`. So, an action index `i` represents claiming the number `i + 1`.
