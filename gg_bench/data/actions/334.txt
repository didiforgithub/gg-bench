The action space indices (0 through 9) in the game environment correspond directly to the lock numbers (1 through 10) minus one. Each index represents a move to open the corresponding lock. For example, an action of 0 opens lock 1, an action of 1 opens lock 2, and so forth, up to an action of 9 opening lock 10.
