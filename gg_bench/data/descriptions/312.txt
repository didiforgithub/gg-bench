# Last Digit Zero - A Two-Player Strategic Number Game

## Objective

Be the **first player** to achieve a cumulative total whose **last digit is zero** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared list.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players (Player 1 and Player 2).
- **Starting Totals**: Both players begin with a cumulative total of **0**.
- **Number Pool**: A shared list of numbers from **1** to **9**.

## Game Components

1. **Shared Number Pool**:

   - Numbers available: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**.
   - Each number can be selected **only once** during the game.

2. **Player Cumulative Totals**:

   - Each player maintains their own cumulative total.
   - Totals start at **0** for both players.
   - Totals are updated by adding selected numbers during the game.

## Turns

- Players take turns in an **alternating fashion**, starting with **Player 1**.
- On a player's turn:
  - **Select** one available number from the shared number pool.
  - **Add** the selected number to your cumulative total.
  - **Remove** the selected number from the shared number pool.
  - **Announce** your new cumulative total.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:

   - You may choose **any one number** from the available numbers in the shared pool.
   - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool and **cannot be selected again**.

2. **Cumulative Total Calculation**:

   - Add the selected number to your current cumulative total.
   - Keep track of your cumulative total after each turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - **Immediate Win**: If, after your turn, your cumulative total **ends with the digit zero** (e.g., 10, 20, 30), you **immediately win** the game.
   - **End of Game Without Immediate Win**: If all numbers have been selected and **no player's cumulative total ends with zero**, proceed to the tiebreaker.

4. **Tiebreaker Conditions**:

   - **Closest to Zero**: The player whose cumulative total's **last digit is closer to zero** wins.
     - For example, a total ending with 1 is closer to zero than a total ending with 9.
   - **Equal Proximity**: If both players are **equally close** to zero (e.g., totals ending with 1 and 9), the player with the **lower cumulative total** wins.

5. **Strategic Considerations**:

   - Be mindful of which numbers remain in the pool and how they can affect both your own and your opponent's cumulative totals.
   - Consider both offensive (reaching a total ending with zero) and defensive (preventing your opponent from doing so) strategies.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by being the first player to reach a cumulative total ending with **zero**.
- **Tiebreaker Victory**: If neither player achieves a cumulative total ending with zero, the winner is determined based on the **tiebreaker conditions** above.
- **No Draws**: The game is designed to avoid draws; a winner will always be determined through the tiebreaker if necessary.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Setup**:

- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Player 1 Total**: 0
- **Player 2 Total**: 0

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Chooses**: 7
- **Calculation**: 0 + 7 = **7**
- **Player 1 Total**: 7
- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Chooses**: 3
- **Calculation**: 0 + 3 = **3**
- **Player 2 Total**: 3
- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Chooses**: 8
- **Calculation**: 7 + 8 = **15**
- **Player 1 Total**: 15
- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Chooses**: 6
- **Calculation**: 3 + 6 = **9**
- **Player 2 Total**: 9
- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Chooses**: 5
- **Calculation**: 15 + 5 = **20**
- **Player 1 Total**: 20
- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 4, 9

---

**Result**:

- **Player 1's cumulative total ends with zero (20)**.
- **Player 1 wins the game!**

### Tiebreaker Scenario

If neither player achieves a cumulative total ending with zero after all numbers are selected:

- **Player 1 Total**: 32 (ends with 2)
- **Player 2 Total**: 37 (ends with 7)

**Determining the Winner**:

- The last digits are **2** and **7**.
- The digit **2** is closer to zero than **7**.
- **Player 1 wins** based on the tiebreaker condition.

If both totals had last digits equally distant from zero:

- For example, Player 1 Total ends with **1**, and Player 2 Total ends with **9**.
- Both are equally distant from zero.
- The player with the **lower cumulative total** (**Player 1**) wins.

## Strategic Tips

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Consider which numbers your opponent may choose and plan accordingly to block their path to victory.
- **Calculate Ahead**: Keep track of potential cumulative totals based on the remaining numbers.
- **Balance High and Low Numbers**: High numbers can help you reach the target quickly but may leave limited options later.

## Game Variations (Optional)

- **Extended Range**: Increase the range of available numbers (e.g., 1 to 15) for a longer game with more strategic possibilities.
- **Alternate Winning Digit**: Change the target last digit from zero to another digit (e.g., aiming for totals ending with the digit 5).
