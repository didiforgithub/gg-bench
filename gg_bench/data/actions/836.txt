In the gym environment for the "Forbidden Adjacent" game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which corresponds directly to the indices of the number line `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. Each index in the action space represents a player's choice to claim a number, with index `0` mapping to the number `1`, index `1` mapping to the number `2`, and so on, up to index `8` mapping to the number `9`. Therefore, an action taken in the environment is simply the selection of a number based on its zero-based index position in the list.
