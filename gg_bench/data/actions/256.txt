The action space in the game maps each index to a specific proper divisor of the starting number, 60. This is facilitated by the `action_to_divisor` dictionary, where keys are action indices and values are divisors. Conversely, `divisor_to_action` allows for reverse mapping. When a player selects an action (index), it corresponds to choosing the divisor at that index. This mapping ensures that each move is uniquely defined by the index, linking actions directly to permissible divisors for division operations in the game. The action space thus provides a structured way to select moves, ensuring that only available and valid divisors are chosen during gameplay.
