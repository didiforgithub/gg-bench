In the "Divide and Conquer" game environment, actions are represented as indices. The action space includes indices corresponding to potential divisors starting from 2 up to one less than the current number, plus an additional index for the "pass" action. Hereâ€™s the mapping:

- **Action Indices 0 to max_actions - 1**: Each index maps to a divisor starting from 2. Specifically, an action index `a` corresponds to the divisor `a + 2`. This means:
  - Index 0 corresponds to the divisor 2.
  - Index 1 corresponds to the divisor 3.
  - Index 2 corresponds to the divisor 4.
  - And so on.

- **Action Index max_actions**: This index corresponds to the "pass" action, which is used when no valid divisors are available. 

The environment uses this index-based action space to efficiently determine divisors and handle moves within the rules of the game.
