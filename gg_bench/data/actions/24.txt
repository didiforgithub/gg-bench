The action space indices in the game map to selecting numbers from the range 2 to 20. Specifically, an action index of 0 corresponds to selecting the number 2, an action index of 1 corresponds to selecting the number 3, and so forth, up to an action index of 18, which corresponds to selecting the number 20. This direct mapping means the action index plus 2 gives the actual game number being selected.
