In the custom gym environment for the game "Sequence Duel," the action space indices are mapped to moves as follows:

- **Indices 0-18**: Each index corresponds to selecting a number from the shared pool. Specifically, index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 18) corresponds to selecting the number `i + 2` from the shared pool. This is because the pool contains numbers ranging from 2 to 20.
- **Index 19**: Represents the 'pass' action, where a player chooses to pass their turn if no valid moves are available.

Thus, the action space allows players to either select a specific number from the pool or opt to pass their turn.
