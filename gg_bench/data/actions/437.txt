The action space indices (0 to 24) map directly to the cells on the 5x5 grid in row-major order. Specifically, index 0 corresponds to the cell at coordinates (1,1), index 1 to the cell at (1,2), and so on, until index 24, which corresponds to the cell at (5,5). Each index represents a potential move by placing a token in the respective cell.
