In the game environment, the action space consists of 20 discrete actions numbered from 0 to 19. Each action index corresponds to a specific node in the game, where action index 0 represents moving to node 1, index 1 to node 2, and so on, up to index 19 which represents moving to node 20. Therefore, to determine the node from an action index, you simply add 1 to the action index. This maps each action to its respective node in the game, allowing players to select moves based on these indices.
