# Prime Division Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the **Current Number** to exactly **1** by strategically dividing it using allowed prime divisors. The player who reaches **1** on their turn wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose.

## Setup

- **Starting the Game**:
  - The game begins with a shared positive integer called the **Current Number**.
  - The default starting **Current Number** is **1000**, but players may agree on any suitable positive integer greater than 1.
- **Players**:
  - The game is designed for **two players**: **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
  - Determine randomly who will take the first turn (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Current Number**:
  - A shared number that players will modify during the game.
  - Initially set to **1000**.
- **Allowed Divisors**:
  - A set of prime numbers: **2**, **3**, **5**, and **7**.
  - Players can only use these primes to divide the **Current Number** if it results in an integer quotient.
- **Players' Roles**:
  - Each player takes turns to strategically reduce the **Current Number** according to the rules.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - The player designated as **Player 1** takes the first turn.
- **Actions During a Turn**:
  1. **Identify Available Divisors**:
     - Determine which of the **Allowed Divisors** evenly divide the **Current Number** (i.e., the divisor leaves no remainder).
  2. **Choose a Divisor**:
     - Select one prime divisor from the available options.
  3. **Divide the Current Number**:
     - Divide the **Current Number** by the chosen divisor to obtain a new **Current Number**.
  4. **Announce the Move**:
     - Clearly state the chosen divisor and the new **Current Number**.
- **Example Turn**:
  - *Player's Turn*: Player 1
  - *Current Number*: 1000
  - *Available Divisors*: 2, 5
  - *Chosen Divisor*: 2
  - *Calculation*: 1000 ÷ 2 = 500
  - *Announcement*: "I divide by 2. The new Current Number is 500."

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the chosen divisor is one of the **Allowed Divisors** and it evenly divides the **Current Number**.
   - If none of the **Allowed Divisors** evenly divide the **Current Number**, the player cannot make a move and loses the game.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - You win if you reduce the **Current Number** to exactly **1** on your turn.
   - The game ends immediately when the **Current Number** reaches **1**.

3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn because no allowed prime divisors evenly divide the **Current Number**, you lose.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.

4. **Gameplay Constraints**:
   - **Division Only**: Players may only perform division operations using the **Allowed Divisors**.
   - **No Skipping Turns**: You must take your turn if able; passing is not allowed.
   - **Clear Communication**: Announce your chosen divisor and the resulting **Current Number** each turn.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The game is won by achieving the objective: reducing the **Current Number** to **1** or by forcing the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.
- **No Points System**:
  - There is no point or scoring system; the outcome is a win or loss based on the game's objective.

## Examples

### Example 1: Winning by Reaching 1

**Starting Current Number**: 1000

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 1000
   - *Available Divisors*: 2, 5
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 5
   - *Calculation*: 1000 ÷ 5 = 200
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 5. The new Current Number is 200."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 200
   - *Available Divisors*: 2, 5
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 2
   - *Calculation*: 200 ÷ 2 = 100
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 2. The new Current Number is 100."

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 100
   - *Available Divisors*: 2, 5
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 5
   - *Calculation*: 100 ÷ 5 = 20
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 5. The new Current Number is 20."

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 20
   - *Available Divisors*: 2, 5
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 2
   - *Calculation*: 20 ÷ 2 = 10
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 2. The new Current Number is 10."

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 10
   - *Available Divisors*: 2, 5
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 5
   - *Calculation*: 10 ÷ 5 = 2
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 5. The new Current Number is 2."

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 2
   - *Available Divisors*: 2
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 2
   - *Calculation*: 2 ÷ 2 = 1
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 2. The new Current Number is 1."
   - **Outcome**: Player 2 wins the game.

### Example 2: Losing Due to No Valid Moves

**Starting Current Number**: 49

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 49
   - *Available Divisors*: 7
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 7
   - *Calculation*: 49 ÷ 7 = 7
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 7. The new Current Number is 7."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - *Current Number*: 7
   - *Available Divisors*: 7
   - *Chosen Divisor*: 7
   - *Calculation*: 7 ÷ 7 = 1
   - *Announcement*: "I divide by 7. The new Current Number is 1."
   - **Outcome**: Player 2 wins the game.

**Alternate Scenario**:

- If the **Current Number** was **13**, none of the **Allowed Divisors** (2, 3, 5, 7) would evenly divide it.
- The player whose turn it is cannot make a valid move and thus loses the game.
- The opponent wins by default.

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

### Starting the Game

```
Welcome to Prime Division Duel!
Enter the starting number (default is 1000): 1000
Player 1 will start the game.
```

### Sample Turn

**Player 1's Turn**:

```
Current Number: 1000
Available Divisors: 2, 5
Player 1, choose your divisor: 2
Player 1 divides by 2.
New Current Number is 500.
```

**Player 2's Turn**:

```
Current Number: 500
Available Divisors: 2, 5
Player 2, choose your divisor: 5
Player 2 divides by 5.
New Current Number is 100.
```

### Continuing Play

- The game continues with players alternating turns, following the same format.
- Each turn updates the **Current Number** until one of the end conditions is met.

## Strategy Tips

- **Anticipate Moves**:
  - Think ahead about how your divisor choice will affect the next turn.
  - Consider which divisors will be available to your opponent after your move.
- **Control the Game Flow**:
  - Aim to leave the **Current Number** in a state where your opponent has fewer options.
- **Avoid Unwinnable Positions**:
  - Try not to reduce the **Current Number** to a prime number that is not among the **Allowed Divisors** on your turn.

## Additional Notes

- **Adjusting Difficulty**:
  - Players can change the starting **Current Number** to make the game shorter or longer.
  - Selecting a smaller starting number results in a quicker game.
- **Custom Allowed Divisors**:
  - Players may agree to modify the set of **Allowed Divisors** before the game begins, as long as they are prime numbers less than 10 (e.g., including or excluding certain primes).
- **Educational Value**:
  - This game helps improve strategic thinking and reinforces knowledge of prime numbers and division.

Enjoy the challenge of Prime Division Duel, and may the best strategist win!
