The mapping between the action space indices and moves in the game is achieved by associating each prime number (which could be a potential divisor of the shared number N) with a specific index in the action space. The list `primes_list` contains prime numbers up to a defined maximum (in this case, 100). Each prime in this list is assigned a unique index using the `prime_to_action` dictionary. Conversely, the `action_to_prime` dictionary translates an action space index back to its corresponding prime number. This mapping enables players to select actions by choosing indices, which are then used to determine the corresponding prime factor to divide the current N during the game.
