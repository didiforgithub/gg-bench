**Number Drop**

**Objective:**

Be the first player to reduce the current number to zero by strategically subtracting valid divisors. The player who successfully brings the current number to zero wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose.

---

**Setup:**

- The game begins with a starting number known as the **Current Number**, which is a positive integer. The standard starting number is **50**, but players can agree on a different positive integer to vary the game's difficulty or length.
- No additional materials or pieces are required.

---

**Game Components:**

- **Current Number:** A positive integer that changes throughout the game as players subtract numbers from it.
- **Allowed Divisors:** Integers from **1** to **9** inclusive. On each turn, a player may choose any of these numbers that exactly divide the Current Number.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players decide who will take the first turn, either by agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.
   - Players then alternate turns throughout the game.

2. **Player Actions:**
   - On their turn, a player must:
     - **Identify Valid Divisors:** Determine all numbers from 1 to 9 that are divisors of the Current Number.
     - **Choose a Divisor:** Select one valid divisor to subtract from the Current Number.
     - **Subtract the Divisor:** Subtract the chosen divisor from the Current Number to obtain a **New Current Number**.
     - **Announce the Move:** Clearly state the chosen divisor and the New Current Number.
   - If the player reduces the Current Number to zero with their subtraction, they **win** the game.
   - If the player cannot find a valid divisor to subtract (i.e., there are no numbers between 1 and 9 that divide the Current Number exactly), they **lose** the game.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - A move is valid if:
     - The chosen number is an integer between **1** and **9** inclusive.
     - The chosen number **exactly divides** the Current Number (no remainders).
     - Subtracting the chosen number from the Current Number results in a **non-negative integer** (zero or positive).

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins if they reduce the Current Number to **zero** on their turn by making a valid move.

3. **Losing the Game:**
   - A player loses if:
     - They cannot make a valid move on their turn because there are no valid divisors available.
     - They make an invalid move (e.g., choose a number that is not a divisor of the Current Number, choose a number outside of 1 to 9, or perform incorrect subtraction).

4. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw. It continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.

5. **Player Conduct:**
   - Players must perform calculations carefully and may use paper and pencil if needed.
   - Both players should verify the validity of each move and the calculations.

---

**Scoring:**

- No points are accumulated during the game.
- The primary goal is to win by reducing the Current Number to zero first.
- Players may keep track of wins over multiple games if desired.

**Examples:**

*Example Game:*

- **Starting Current Number:** 50

---

1. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 50
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 2, 5
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 5
   - **Calculation:** 50 - 5 = 45
   - **New Current Number:** 45
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 5 from 50, the new Current Number is 45."

---

2. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 45
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 3, 5, 9
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 9
   - **Calculation:** 45 - 9 = 36
   - **New Current Number:** 36
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 9 from 45, the new Current Number is 36."

---

3. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 36
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 6
   - **Calculation:** 36 - 6 = 30
   - **New Current Number:** 30
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 6 from 36, the new Current Number is 30."

---

4. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 30
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 6
   - **Calculation:** 30 - 6 = 24
   - **New Current Number:** 24
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 6 from 30, the new Current Number is 24."

---

5. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 24
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 8
   - **Calculation:** 24 - 8 = 16
   - **New Current Number:** 16
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 8 from 24, the new Current Number is 16."

---

6. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 16
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 2, 4, 8
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 8
   - **Calculation:** 16 - 8 = 8
   - **New Current Number:** 8
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 8 from 16, the new Current Number is 8."

---

7. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 8
   - **Valid Divisors (1-9):** 1, 2, 4, 8
   - **Chosen Divisor:** 8
   - **Calculation:** 8 - 8 = 0
   - **New Current Number:** 0
   - **Announcement:** "I subtract 8 from 8, the new Current Number is 0. I win!"

**Command-Line Interaction Example:**

*Assuming input prompts and outputs for clarity.*

- **Game Start:**

  ```
  Starting Number: 50
  ```

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  ```
  Current Number: 50
  Valid Divisors (1-9): 1, 2, 5
  Enter your chosen divisor: 5
  You subtracted 5. New Current Number is 45.
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  ```
  Current Number: 45
  Valid Divisors (1-9): 1, 3, 5, 9
  Enter your chosen divisor: 9
  You subtracted 9. New Current Number is 36.
  ```

- *(Subsequent turns proceed similarly.)*

- **Player 1's Winning Move:**

  ```
  Current Number: 8
  Valid Divisors (1-9): 1, 2, 4, 8
  Enter your chosen divisor: 8
  You subtracted 8. New Current Number is 0.
  Congratulations! You reduced the number to zero and won the game!
  ```

**Strategic Tips:**

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice will affect the Current Number and the options available to your opponent on their next turn.
- **Control the Game Flow:** Try to leave the Current Number in a state where your opponent has fewer valid divisors to choose from.
- **Avoid Common Divisors:** If possible, subtract divisors that are less likely to be available on your opponent's turn, limiting their options.
- **Balance Risk and Reward:** Sometimes, choosing a smaller divisor may be strategically better to avoid giving your opponent an advantage.
