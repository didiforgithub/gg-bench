In the provided gym environment for the Numerical Duel game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(4)`, representing four possible actions with indices 0 to 3. These indices map directly to subtracting numbers 1 to 4 from the shared total:

- Action index `0` corresponds to subtracting `1`.
- Action index `1` corresponds to subtracting `2`.
- Action index `2` corresponds to subtracting `3`.
- Action index `3` corresponds to subtracting `4`. 

This mapping allows a player to choose an action represented by an index, which is then used to determine the number to subtract from the current total.
