The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` class for the Factor Fury game range from 0 to 48, corresponding to the numbers from 2 to 50. Specifically, the action index `i` maps to the number `i + 2`. This means that when a player selects an action with index `i`, they are choosing the number `2 + i` from the pool. Each index represents a unique number that can be picked during the game, and once selected, it is marked as unavailable.
