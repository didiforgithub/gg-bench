# Rule Book for the Game: **Charge**

## Objective

Be the first player to accumulate **exactly 15 charge points** by strategically playing action cards to increase your own charge, block your opponent's charge, and steal charge points from your opponent. Overshooting the goal resets your charge to zero, so plan your moves carefully!

2. **Action Cards**: Each player receives a set of action cards:

3. **Card Management**:
   - Cards are held privately by each player.
   - In a command-line interface, players can view their remaining cards at any time.

2. **Player Actions**:

4. **Discarding Cards**:
   - After playing a card, remove it from your hand; it cannot be played again unless all cards are refreshed.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Charge Card

- **Function**: Increases your charge points by a chosen amount.
- **Usage**:
  - Declare that you're playing a **Charge Card**.
  - Choose a number between **1 and 5** (inclusive) to add to your charge points.
  - Announce the amount added and your new total charge.

- **Example**:
  - "Player 1 plays a Charge Card and adds **3** charge points. Total charge is now **9**."

### 2. Block Card

- **Function**: Blocks your opponent from gaining charge points on their next turn.
- **Usage**:
  - Declare that you're playing a **Block Card**.
  - The Block effect remains active until the end of your opponent's next turn.
  - Your opponent must still play a card on their turn; if they play a Charge Card, it has no effect, but the card is still discarded.
  - Block does not affect Steal Cards.

- **Example**:
  - "Player 2 plays a Block Card. Player 1's next charge will be blocked."

### 3. Steal Card

- **Function**: Steals the amount of charge points your opponent gained during their last turn.
- **Usage**:
  - Declare that you're playing a **Steal Card**.
  - Transfer the charge points your opponent gained in their last turn to your charge total.
  - Deduct the stolen charge points from your opponent's total.
  - If your opponent gained no charge points on their last turn (e.g., they were blocked or played a non-Charge Card), the Steal Card has no effect.

- **Example**:
  - "Player 1 plays a Steal Card and steals **4** charge points from Player 2. Player 1's total is now **13**; Player 2's total is now **5**."

### 4. Exceeding 15 Charge Points

- **Penalty**:
  - If your charge points exceed **15** at any time, your total resets to **0**.
  - This rule applies immediately, even during your own turn.

- **Example**:
  - "Player 2 adds **4** charge points to reach **16**, exceeding the limit. Player 2's charge resets to **0**."

### 5. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to reach **exactly 15 charge points** wins the game.
  - Monitor both your own and your opponent's charge totals to anticipate winning opportunities.

---

## Scoring

- **Charge Points Tracking**:
  - Keep a running total of your charge points.
  - Both players should track and announce their charge totals after each turn.
  - In a command-line game, the system should display updated totals after each action.

- **No Point System**:
  - There is no cumulative scoring across games; each game is a standalone match.
  - Focus is on strategic use of action cards to reach the exact charge total needed.

## Strategic Depth and Complexity

- **Card Management**: With limited action cards, players must decide the optimal time to use each card, balancing immediate gains against future needs.
- **Prediction and Anticipation**: Observing your opponent's actions helps predict their remaining cards, allowing you to counter their strategy effectively.
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Choosing how many charge points to add involves risk; adding too many may lead to overshooting, while adding too few prolongs the game.
- **Bluffing and Deception**: Players may bluff about their intentions to mislead their opponent into misusing their Block or Steal Cards.
