# Number Tower Duel

## Objective

**Be the first player to successfully place all your numbered tiles onto the shared towers, or force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.** Victory is achieved by strategically stacking your numbers while blocking your opponent's options.

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players are required.
2. **Tiles**: Each player receives a set of numbered tiles from 1 to 5 (five tiles in total).
3. **Towers**: There are three shared towers labeled Tower A, Tower B, and Tower C. All towers start empty.
4. **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin or agree mutually).

## Game Components

- **Numbered Tiles (1-5)**:
  - Each tile is numbered from 1 to 5.
  - Tiles are unique within a player's hand; each number from 1 to 5 appears once.
  - Tiles are represented by their numbers in the command-line interface.

- **Towers (A, B, C)**:
  - Shared between players.
  - Each tower is a stack where tiles are placed on top of one another.
  - Towers are empty at the start of the game.
  - Towers can be represented as lists showing the sequence of tiles from bottom to top.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player chosen during setup.
- **Player Actions on Their Turn**:
  1. **View Game State**: Optionally view the current state of all towers and remaining tiles in hand.
  2. **Select Tile**: Choose one tile from your hand to play.
  3. **Select Tower**: Choose one of the three towers (A, B, or C) to place your tile.
  4. **Place Tile**: Place your tile on the selected tower according to the placement rules.
- **Turn Progression**: After placing a tile, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Tile Placement Rules

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - **Empty Tower**: You may place any of your tiles on an empty tower.
   - **Non-Empty Tower**: You may place a tile on top of a tower only if your tile's number is **higher** than the number on the top tile of that tower.
2. **Invalid Moves**:
   - You cannot place a tile on a tower if your tile's number is equal to or lower than the number on the top tile of that tower.
   - You cannot place a tile on a tower if you have no tiles with higher numbers than the top tile.
3. **Tile Usage**:
   - Once a tile is placed on a tower, it cannot be moved or played again.
   - Each tile can only be used once per game.

### Forced Pass and End of Game

- **Forced Pass**:
  - If a player has no valid moves (cannot place any of their remaining tiles on any tower), they must pass their turn.
- **End of Game**:
  - **Winning by Placement**: If a player successfully places all their tiles onto the towers, they win the game immediately.
  - **Winning by Opponent's Inability**: If both players pass consecutively because neither can make a valid move, the player with fewer remaining tiles in hand wins.
  - **Tie-Breaker**:
    - If both players have the same number of remaining tiles after consecutive passes, the player whose tiles have a lower total sum wins.
    - If still tied, the game proceeds in sudden death: players remove the top tile from any tower (starting with the last player who placed a tile) and see if new moves are possible.

## Scoring

- **Primary Goal**: There is no point scoring system; the objective is to be the first to place all your tiles or to force your opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **Tie-Breaker Rankings**:
  1. Fewest tiles remaining.
  2. Lowest total of remaining tile numbers.
  3. Sudden death play if still tied.

## Strategy Tips

- **Prioritize Lower Numbers Early**: Play your lower-numbered tiles on empty towers to maximize future placement options.
- **Block Your Opponent**: Anticipate your opponent's remaining tiles and aim to limit their valid moves.
- **Tower Management**: Be cautious about building towers too high too quickly, as it may restrict your own future moves.
- **Balance**: Try to balance the distribution of your tiles among the towers to avoid being forced into a pass.
