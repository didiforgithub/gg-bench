The action space in the game is defined as a discrete space with 2 possible actions: `0` and `1`. The indices of the action space directly map to the moves available to the players in the game. Specifically:

- Index `0` corresponds to appending the binary digit `0` to the sequence.
- Index `1` corresponds to appending the binary digit `1` to the sequence.

Each index thus represents a choice of bit that a player can append to the binary sequence on their turn.
