# Number Quest: A Strategic Grid Game

## Objective

**Number Quest** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a numerical grid. The primary goal is to accumulate the highest total score by strategically selecting cells from a hidden number grid. Players use provided sum clues to deduce high-value numbers' locations. The player with the highest total score after all cells have been revealed wins the game.

## Setup

- **Game Grid**: A 3x3 grid, forming nine cells in total.
- **Hidden Numbers**: Each cell contains a unique number from **1** to **9**, randomly assigned without repeats.
- **Sum Clues**: The sums of the numbers in each **row**, **column**, and **diagonal** are calculated and displayed to both players.
- **Initial Display**:

  ```
   Positions:    Grid:          Clues:

    [1][2][3]     [ ][ ][ ]     Row 1 Sum: XX
    [4][5][6]     [ ][ ][ ]     Row 2 Sum: XX
    [7][8][9]     [ ][ ][ ]     Row 3 Sum: XX

    Column Sums:  Col 1: XX, Col 2: XX, Col 3: XX
    Diagonal Sums: Diag1: XX, Diag2: XX
  ```

- **Starting Conditions**: Both players begin with a score of **0**.

## Game Components

- **Grid Positions**: Cells are numbered from **1** to **9** for selection purposes.
- **Hidden Numbers**: Unique integers from **1** to **9** placed randomly in the grid.
- **Sum Clues**:
  - **Row Sums**: Total of numbers in each horizontal row.
  - **Column Sums**: Total of numbers in each vertical column.
  - **Diagonal Sums**: Total of numbers in the two diagonals.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
- **During a Turn**:
  1. **Select a Cell**: The player chooses an unrevealed cell by its position number (1-9).
  2. **Reveal the Number**: The hidden number in the selected cell is revealed to both players.
  3. **Update Score**: The player's score increases by the value of the revealed number.
  4. **Update Grid**: The grid display updates to show the revealed number in its position.

- **Turn Progression**: Turns continue alternately until all cells have been revealed.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Cell Selection**:
  - Players may only select from unrevealed cells.
  - Once a cell is chosen, it cannot be selected again.

- **Information Usage**:
  - Players use the provided sum clues to deduce the possible numbers in each cell.
  - Logical reasoning helps identify high-value numbers to maximize scoring.

- **Number Uniqueness**:
  - Each number from **1** to **9** appears exactly once in the grid.

- **Game End**:
  - The game concludes after nine turns when all cells have been revealed.

## Scoring

- **Score Calculation**:
  - Each playerâ€™s score is the sum of the numbers they have revealed during their turns.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player with the **higher total score** at the end of the game wins.
  - In the case of equal scores (which is highly unlikely due to number uniqueness and strategic play), the last player to take a turn is declared the winner, ensuring no draw.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Game State

```
Positions:    Grid:          Clues:

[1][2][3]     [ ][ ][ ]     Row 1 Sum: 15
[4][5][6]     [ ][ ][ ]     Row 2 Sum: 15
[7][8][9]     [ ][ ][ ]     Row 3 Sum: 15

Column Sums:  Col 1: 15, Col 2: 15, Col 3: 15
Diagonal Sums: Diag1: 15, Diag2: 15
```

_Note: In this simplified example, all sums are 15, indicating that the numbers are arranged such that each row, column, and diagonal sums to 15._

#### Turn-by-Turn Interaction

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Selects position **5**.
- **Reveal**: Number **5** is revealed at position **5**.
- **Score Update**: Player 1's score is now **5**.

**Updated Grid**:

```
[ ][ ][ ]
[ ][5][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]

Scores:
Player 1: 5
Player 2: 0
```

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Analyzing clues and the revealed **5**, selects position **1**.
- **Reveal**: Number **8** is revealed at position **1**.
- **Score Update**: Player 2's score is now **8**.

**Updated Grid**:

```
[8][ ][ ]
[ ][5][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]

Scores:
Player 1: 5
Player 2: 8
```

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Uses clues and existing numbers, selects position **9**.
- **Reveal**: Number **2** is revealed at position **9**.
- **Score Update**: Player 1's score is now **7** (previous 5 + 2).

**Updated Grid**:

```
[8][ ][ ]
[ ][5][ ]
[ ][ ][2]

Scores:
Player 1: 7
Player 2: 8
```

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action**: Selects position **3**.
- **Reveal**: Number **4** is revealed at position **3**.
- **Score Update**: Player 2's score is now **12** (previous 8 + 4).

**Updated Grid**:

```
[8][ ][4]
[ ][5][ ]
[ ][ ][2]

Scores:
Player 1: 7
Player 2: 12
```

_...Game continues until all cells are revealed..._

#### Final Scores

After all turns:

**Final Grid**:

```
[8][1][4]
[3][5][7]
[6][9][2]
```

**Final Scores**:

- **Player 1**: Sum of numbers picked (5 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 1) = **21**
- **Player 2**: Sum of numbers picked (8 + 4 + 3 + 9) = **24**

**Winner**: **Player 2** wins with a higher total score of **24**.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Grid:

[8][ ][ ]
[ ][5][ ]
[ ][ ][ ]

...

[Game continues]

## Strategy Tips

- **Analyze Sum Clues**: Use the row, column, and diagonal sums to narrow down possible numbers in unrevealed cells.
- **Target High Sums**: Rows or columns with higher sums are likely to contain higher numbers.
- **Track Revealed Numbers**: Keep track of numbers already revealed to refine your deductions.
- **Block Opponent**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and select high-value cells before they do.
- **Plan Ahead**: Think several moves ahead to maximize your total score over the course of the game.

## Game Example with Reasoning

Suppose the initial sum clues are as follows:

```
Row Sums: Row 1: 17, Row 2: 13, Row 3: 15
Column Sums: Col 1: 15, Col 2: 11, Col 3: 19
Diagonal Sums: Diag1: 15, Diag2: 15
```

**Deduction Steps**:

- **Row 1 Sum is 17**: The numbers in Row 1 sum to 17.
- **Highest Possible Sum in a Row with 3 Numbers**: 9 + 8 + 7 = 24, so 17 is relatively moderate, indicating middle-range numbers.
- **Column 3 Sum is 19**: High sum suggests high numbers in Column 3.

**Potential Strategy**:

- **Player 1** might choose a cell in Column 3, say position **3**, aiming for a high number.
- **Player 2** might then select another high-sum area, perhaps position **7** in Row 3.

By combining the clues and strategic thinking, players can make informed choices to maximize their scores.
