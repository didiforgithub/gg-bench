In the game, each possible action corresponds to a unique multiplier from 2 to 9. The action space indices (0 to 7) directly map to these multipliers in the following way: index 0 corresponds to multiplier 2, index 1 to 3, index 2 to 4, index 3 to 5, index 4 to 6, index 5 to 7, index 6 to 8, and index 7 to 9. This mapping allows players to choose an action by selecting an index, which translates to using the associated multiplier to update the running total.
