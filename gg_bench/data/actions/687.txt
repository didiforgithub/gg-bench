In the gym environment, the action space indices are mapped as follows:

- **Indices 0-8**: Correspond to the "Push" action, where each index represents pushing numbers 1 to 9 into the stack. Specifically, index `n` will push the number `n+1`.
- **Indices 9-11**: Correspond to the "Operate" action using arithmetic operations. Index 9 is addition (`+`), index 10 is subtraction (`-`), and index 11 is multiplication (`*`).
