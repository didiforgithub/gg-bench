## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Toggling Lights:**
   - **Single Light Toggle:**
     - You may turn **OFF** one light that is **ON**.
   - **Double Light Toggle:**
     - You may turn **OFF** two **adjacent** lights that are both **ON**.
     - **Adjacency:** Two lights are adjacent if their numbers are consecutive (e.g., lights 3 and 4).

2. **Light States:**
   - **ON Lights:** Can be toggled **OFF**.
   - **OFF Lights:** Cannot be toggled; they remain off for the rest of the game.

3. **Valid Moves:**
   - You cannot skip your turn.
   - If there are no valid moves (no lights are **ON**), the game ends, and you lose your turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:** You win if you turn **OFF** the last remaining **ON** light.
- **Forced Loss:** If it's your turn and all lights are **OFF**, you lose because you have no valid moves.

### Special Considerations

- **No Skipping:** You must perform an action on your turn if possible.
- **Action Limits:** You cannot turn OFF more than two lights in a single turn.
- **Light Selection:** You cannot turn OFF non-adjacent lights when choosing to toggle two lights.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome:** The game is won by achieving the objective; there is no point scoring.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the structure of turns and the finite number of lights.
