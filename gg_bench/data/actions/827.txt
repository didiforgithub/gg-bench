The action space consists of 18 discrete actions indexed from 0 to 17. Indices 0 to 8 correspond to selecting a number from 1 to 9 without attempting an equation, while indices 9 to 17 correspond to selecting a number from 1 to 9 and attempting an equation. Specifically, index `2n` represents selecting the number `n+1` without an equation attempt, and index `2n+1` represents selecting the number `n+1` with an equation attempt, where `n` is from 0 to 8, mapping to numbers 1 through 9.
