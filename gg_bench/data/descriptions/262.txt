# Multiplication Showdown

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly 100** by strategically multiplying the current number using integers between 2 and 9. Avoid exceeding the target number to secure victory.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with the current number set to **1**.
2. **Players**: Two players participate, deciding randomly or by agreement who takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that changes each turn based on player actions. Initially set to **1**.
- **Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive. These are the numbers players will use to multiply the current number.
- **Target Number**: The number **100**. Players aim to reach this number exactly.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Player Action**:
  - On their turn, a player selects a multiplier (an integer between 2 and 9).
  - The player multiplies the **current number** by the chosen multiplier.
  - The **product** becomes the new current number.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing a Multiplier**:
   - Players must select a multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - The chosen multiplier is applied to the current number to produce a new current number.

2. **Updating the Current Number**:
   - Multiply the current number by the selected multiplier.
   - Example: If the current number is 5 and the player chooses 3, the new current number is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \).

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player's action results in the current number being **exactly 100**, that player **wins** the game immediately.

4. **Exceeding 100**:
   - If a player's action causes the current number to exceed 100, that player **loses** the game immediately.
   - Players must carefully choose multipliers to avoid surpassing the target number.

5. **Forced Loss**:
   - If it is a player's turn and all possible multipliers would cause the current number to exceed 100, the player **loses** the game.
   - Players must strategize to avoid being left without valid moves.

6. **Valid Moves Requirement**:
   - Players must select a multiplier that results in a new current number greater than the current number but not exceeding 100.
   - Skipping a turn or selecting invalid multipliers is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Reaching exactly 100 on your turn.
- **Losing**: Causing the current number to exceed 100 or having no valid moves on your turn.

_No points are accumulated; the game results in a win or loss based on the above conditions._

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1**
  - Current Number: 1
  - Chooses Multiplier: **5**
  - Calculation: \( 1 \times 5 = 5 \)
  - New Current Number: **5**

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 2**
  - Current Number: 5
  - Chooses Multiplier: **9**
  - Calculation: \( 5 \times 9 = 45 \)
  - New Current Number: **45**

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1**
  - Current Number: 45
  - Chooses Multiplier: **2**
  - Calculation: \( 45 \times 2 = 90 \)
  - New Current Number: **90**

**Turn 4**:
- **Player 2**
  - Current Number: 90
  - Must choose a multiplier between 2 and 9 such that the product does not exceed 100.
  - Possible Multipliers: None (all multipliers will exceed 100)
  - **Player 2 loses** due to no valid moves.

**Winner**: **Player 1**

### Example Game 2

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1**
  - Current Number: 1
  - Chooses Multiplier: **2**
  - Calculation: \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \)
  - New Current Number: **2**

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 2**
  - Current Number: 2
  - Chooses Multiplier: **5**
  - Calculation: \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - New Current Number: **10**

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1**
  - Current Number: 10
  - Chooses Multiplier: **9**
  - Calculation: \( 10 \times 9 = 90 \)
  - New Current Number: **90**

**Turn 4**:
- **Player 2**
  - Current Number: 90
  - Chooses Multiplier: **\* (No valid multiplier as all options exceed 100)**
  - **Player 2 loses** due to no valid moves.

**Winner**: **Player 1**

---

### Example Game 3

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1**
  - Current Number: 1
  - Chooses Multiplier: **4**
  - Calculation: \( 1 \times 4 = 4 \)
  - New Current Number: **4**

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 2**
  - Current Number: 4
  - Chooses Multiplier: **5**
  - Calculation: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
  - New Current Number: **20**

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1**
  - Current Number: 20
  - Chooses Multiplier: **5**
  - Calculation: \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \)
  - New Current Number: **100**

- **Player 1 wins** by reaching exactly 100.

**Winner**: **Player 1**

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of multipliers several moves in advance to avoid being trapped.
- **Control the Pace**: Early in the game, consider smaller multipliers to maintain control over the current number.
- **Force Opponent's Hand**: Try to position the current number so that your opponent has no valid moves.
