In the Sum31 game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 possible actions, corresponding to indices 0 through 8. Each index in the action space maps directly to selecting a number from the pool of available numbers, specifically the numbers 1 to 9. The mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index: an action index of 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, an action index of 1 corresponds to number 2, and so on, up to an action index of 8, which corresponds to number 9. This mapping ensures that each action index uniquely corresponds to one of the numbers available in the pool.
