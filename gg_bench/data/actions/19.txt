In the given gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to `N_initial` (inclusive). Each index represents a potential factor that can be chosen as a move in the game. However, only indices corresponding to valid factors of the current number `N` can be used as moves. A valid move is an action index that is a factor of `N`, has not been used already, and is neither 1 nor `N` itself. The mapping implies that a player needs to choose an index that directly corresponds to a valid factor of `N` for a move to be legal.
