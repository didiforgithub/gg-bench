The action space indices from 0 to 17 correspond to the possible moves a player can make during the game. Each action index represents a combination of an operator (either '+' or '-') and a number from 1 to 9. Specifically, indices 0 to 8 map to using the '+' operator with numbers 1 through 9, respectively. Indices 9 to 17 map to using the '-' operator with numbers 1 through 9, respectively.
