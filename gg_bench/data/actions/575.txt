The action space indices (0 to 124) in the game map to the possible guesses of three-digit codes, using digits 1 to 5 for each position. This is achieved by indexing into a precomputed list of all permutations of three-digit combinations made from numbers 1 to 5. The ith index corresponds to the ith combination in this list, whereby each number's position in the code is derived from a cartesian product of the possible digits, resulting in a total of 5^3 = 125 combinations. Each action taken represents selecting a specific combination from this list as the guess for the guessing phase.
