The action space indices (0-19) directly map to the number selections (1-20) in the game. Each index corresponds to the number that is selected by subtracting 1: index 0 is number 1, index 1 is number 2, ..., index 19 is number 20. When a player takes an action, it refers to the index of the number being selected from the list.
