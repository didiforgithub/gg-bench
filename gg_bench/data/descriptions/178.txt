# Divide and Conquer: A Strategic Two-Player Game

## Objective

**"Divide and Conquer"** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move. Players take turns dividing piles of stones into two unequal smaller piles. The player who makes the last valid split wins the game, thereby conquering the board.

## Setup

1. **Initial Pile**: The game starts with a single pile containing a prime number of stones. By default, this number is **13**, but players can agree on any prime number to begin with (e.g., 7, 11, 17).

2. **Player Assignment**: Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Command-Line Interface**: Ensure that the game is set up in a command-line environment where players can input commands and view the game's status.

## Game Components

- **Stones**: Represented numerically as counts within piles. There are no physical stones; counts are tracked within the program.
  
- **Piles**: A list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The initial setup has one pile with the starting number of stones (e.g., `[13]`).

- **Players**: Two participants taking turns in the game, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns. The player designated to go first begins the game.

- **Player Actions During a Turn**:
  1. **Select a Pile**: Choose one of the existing piles that has at least **3** stones.
  2. **Divide the Pile**: Split the selected pile into two **unequal** smaller integer piles (e.g., splitting a pile of 7 into piles of 5 and 2).

- **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their move, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Splits**:
   - **Minimum Pile Size for Splitting**: Only piles with **3 or more** stones can be split.
   - **Unequal Piles**: When splitting, the two new piles must contain a different number of stones. Splitting a pile of 6 into 3 and 3 is **not allowed**.
   - **Integer Stones**: Stones are indivisible; splits must result in whole numbers.

2. **Piles of Size 1 or 2**:
   - Piles containing **1 or 2** stones cannot be split further and remain on the board until the game's end.

3. **No Skipping**:
   - Players must make a valid move on their turn if possible. Skipping a turn is not allowed.

4. **Game End Condition**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move because there are no piles of size 3 or greater to split.
   - The **last player** who made a valid move **wins** the game.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: Victory is achieved by being the player to make the last valid split.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking; the outcome is a win or loss.
- **Match Play**: Players can decide to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.
