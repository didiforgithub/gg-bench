The action space indices represent the flattening of the 5x5 grid into a single array of length 25. Each index corresponds to a cell in the grid, starting from 0 (top-left corner, 1,1) to 24 (bottom-right corner, 5,5). Specifically, the action index `i` corresponds to the grid position `(row, column)` where `row = i // 5` and `column = i % 5`. This mapping allows players to select grid cells by choosing a discrete action index between 0 and 24.
