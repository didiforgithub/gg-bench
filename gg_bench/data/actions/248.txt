In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 7) are mapped to the available multipliers (2 to 9) used in the game as follows: each action index directly corresponds to a multiplier by adding 2 to the index. Therefore, action index 0 maps to multiplier 2, index 1 maps to multiplier 3, and so on, up to index 7 which maps to multiplier 9.
