# Factor Frenzy

Welcome to **Factor Frenzy**, a strategic two-player turn-based game of numbers and foresight. Engage in a battle of wits as you and your opponent select numbers, eliminating options and aiming to outmaneuver each other. Simple to learn yet rich in strategy, **Factor Frenzy** promises quick gameplay with depth for those who seek it.

## Objective

The primary goal of **Factor Frenzy** is to be the last player able to select a valid number from the available list. On each turn, players pick a number, which then affects the choices available in subsequent turns. A player loses if they cannot select a valid number on their turn.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool**: Create a list of integers from **2 to 50**, inclusive.
2. **Available Numbers**: Initially, all numbers in the list are available for selection.
3. **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin or have the younger player start).

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: The numbers **2 through 50** act as the central elements of the game.
- **Selection List**: A dynamic list that updates as numbers are chosen and eliminated.
- **Player Indicators**: Each player may be represented by their name or an identifier (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2).

The game is played in a command-line interface where the current state of the **Available Numbers** list is displayed after each turn.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the designated first player.
- **Player Actions**:
  - **Select a Number**: On your turn, choose any number from the **Available Numbers** list.
  - **Update List**: After selection, eliminate certain numbers from the list based on the rules.
- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until a player cannot make a valid selection on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Selecting a Number

- **Valid Selection**: You may select **any number** from the **Available Numbers** list.
- **Unique Selection**: A number can only be selected **once** during the game.

### 2. Eliminating Numbers

After a number is selected:

- **Remove the Selected Number**: The chosen number is removed from the **Available Numbers** list.
- **Remove Proper Divisors**:
  - Eliminate all proper divisors of the selected number from the list.
  - *Proper Divisors* are numbers less than the selected number that divide it exactly (without leaving a remainder).
- **Remove Proper Multiples**:
  - Eliminate all proper multiples of the selected number from the list.
  - *Proper Multiples* are numbers greater than the selected number that the selected number divides into exactly.

**Note**: The number **1** is excluded from the game and is not considered a proper divisor for the purposes of elimination.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: If your opponent cannot select a valid number on their turn because there are no valid options remaining, you win the game.
- **Forfeit**: If a player erroneously selects an invalid number (e.g., a number not in the Available Numbers list), they forfeit the game.

## Scoring

**Factor Frenzy** is typically played in single rounds with the winner being the player who successfully forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves.

For extended play:

- **Match Play**: Players can compete in a series of games (e.g., best of three or five).
- **Point System**:
  - **Win**: 1 point.
  - **Loss**: 0 points.
- The player with the most points at the end of the series wins the match.

## Strategic Tips

- **Prioritize Prime Numbers**: Selecting prime numbers can be advantageous since they have no proper divisors (other than 1, which is excluded).
- **Block Opponent Options**: Choose numbers whose multiples are still available to eliminate more options for your opponent.
- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of remaining numbers and anticipate possible moves to avoid being trapped without options.
- **Avoid Early Selection of Highly Composite Numbers**: Numbers with many divisors and multiples (like 12, 18, 24) can reduce your own future options along with your opponent's.

## Conclusion

**Factor Frenzy** is a captivating game that combines simple arithmetic with strategic planning. Its straightforward rules make it easy to learn, while the depth of strategy provides a challenge for players seeking a competitive experience. Enjoy sharpening your numerical and tactical skills in this exciting numerical showdown!
