# **Portal Runner**

## **Objective**

Be the first player to reach your opponent's starting position *after* passing through the central portal. Strategically navigate the grid and place blocks to hinder your opponent while ensuring a clear path for yourself.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Game Board:** A 5x5 grid with coordinates ranging from (1,1) at the top-left corner to (5,5) at the bottom-right corner.

2. **Starting Positions:**
   - **Player 1:** Starts at the top-left corner (1,1).
   - **Player 2:** Starts at the bottom-right corner (5,5).

3. **Portal:**
   - Located at the center of the grid at position (3,3).
   - The portal is a special cell that players must pass through before heading to the opponent's starting position.

4. **Blocks:**
   - Each player has an unlimited supply of blocks to place on the grid during their turn.

5. **Initial Grid State:**
   - All cells are empty except for the players' starting positions and the central portal.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Grid:**
  - A 5x5 matrix representing the game board.
  - Cells can be empty, occupied by a player, contain the portal, or have a block.

- **Player Markers:**
  - Each player has a unique marker to represent their position on the grid (e.g., 'P1' and 'P2').

- **Blocks:**
  - Represented by 'X' on the grid.
  - Used to obstruct the opponent's movement.

- **Portal Cell:**
  - Represented by 'O' on the grid.
  - A mandatory passage point for victory.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns.
   - Determine who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.

2. **Actions Per Turn:**
   - On your turn, you must perform **one** of the following actions:
     - **Move**: Move your marker to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).
     - **Place a Block**: Place a block on any empty cell of the grid.

3. **Movement Rules:**
   - You may move to any adjacent cell that is:
     - Not blocked.
     - Not occupied by the opponent.
   - You cannot move diagonally.

4. **Block Placement Rules:**
   - Blocks can be placed on any empty cell except:
     - The portal cell (3,3).
     - A cell occupied by either player's marker.
   - Blocks remain on the grid for the rest of the game.
   - You **cannot** place a block on a cell adjacent to your opponent's current position.

5. **Turn Progression:**
   - After performing your action, your turn ends.
   - The opponent then takes their turn.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Passing Through the Portal:**
   - Before heading to your opponent's starting position, you **must** land on the portal cell (3,3).
   - You can only pass through the portal **once** per game.
   - After passing through the portal, proceed towards the opponent's starting position.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to reach their opponent's starting position **after** passing through the portal wins the game.

3. **Blocking Strategies:**
   - Use blocks to hinder your opponent's path.
   - Ensure that you do not completely surround the opponent, making it impossible for them to move.
     - **Rule of Fair Play:** At least one possible path must remain open for the opponent at all times.

4. **Stalemate Condition:**
   - If a player has no legal moves (i.e., they are completely blocked and cannot move), they **lose** the game.
   - Players cannot pass their turn.

5. **Illegal Moves:**
   - Attempting to move through a blocked cell or off the grid is illegal.
   - Placing a block on the portal or adjacent to the opponent's current position is illegal.
   - Illegal moves result in forfeiture of that turn.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game:**
  - Victory is achieved by reaching the opponent's starting position after passing through the portal.
  - There are no points or scores; the game is won by accomplishing the objective.

---

## **Game Strategies**

- **Block Placement:**
  - Use blocks to redirect your opponent or slow their progress.
  - Avoid completely trapping the opponent, as it's against the rules.

- **Path Planning:**
  - Plan your route to the portal and beyond.
  - Anticipate your opponent's moves and adjust accordingly.

- **Balancing Actions:**
  - Decide when to advance and when to place blocks.
  - Overcommitting to blocking may slow down your own progress.

## **Additional Notes**

- **Adaptability:**
  - The game can be scaled to larger grids (e.g., 7x7) for increased complexity.

- **Variations:**
  - Introduce special cells with unique properties (e.g., teleportation points, one-time block removals).

- **Fair Play:**
  - Players should maintain a fair playing environment, avoiding unsportsmanlike conduct such as intentionally breaking rules.
