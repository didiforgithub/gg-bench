In the provided gym environment for the Divide and Conquer game, each action index in the action space corresponds to a possible divisor in the game. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.MAX_D - 1)`, which means it contains integer values starting from 0 to `self.MAX_D - 2`. Each action index `a` is mapped to a divisor `d` using the formula `d = a + 2`. This mapping starts at divisor 2 for action 0 because divisors must be greater than 1. Thus, action 0 corresponds to divisor 2, action 1 corresponds to divisor 3, and so on, up to the maximum divisor determined by the square root of the current number.
