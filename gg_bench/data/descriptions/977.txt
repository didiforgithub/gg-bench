# Command Clash: Rule Book

## Objective

**Command Clash** is a two-player turn-based strategy game where players engage in a battle of wits and resource management. The primary goal is to **reduce your opponent's Command Points (CP) to zero or below** by strategically choosing actions each turn. Players must manage their CP wisely, anticipate their opponent's moves, and decide the best moments to attack, defend, or recharge.

## Setup

- **Starting Command Points**: Both players begin the game with **5 Command Points (CP)**.
- **Maximum Command Points**: A player cannot have more than **5 CP** at any time.
- **Game Start**: Determine who will enter their action first if necessary (though actions are resolved simultaneously).

## Game Components

- **Command Points (CP)**: Represents a player's resources required to perform actions.
  - **Appearance**: Numerical value ranging from **0 to 5**.
  - **Functionality**: CP are spent to perform actions like Attack, Special Attack, and Shield, and can be replenished by using the Charge action.
- **Actions**: 
  - **Charge**
    - **Cost**: 0 CP
    - **Effect**: Gain **+1 CP** (cannot exceed 5 CP)
  - **Attack**
    - **Cost**: 1 CP
    - **Effect**: Deal **1 damage** to the opponent unless they have used Shield
  - **Special Attack**
    - **Cost**: 3 CP
    - **Effect**: Deal **3 damage** to the opponent unless they have used Shield
  - **Shield**
    - **Cost**: 1 CP
    - **Effect**: Blocks all damage from the opponent's Attack or Special Attack for that turn

## Turns

- **Simultaneous Action Selection**: Both players secretly choose one action each turn.
- **Action Submission**: Players input their chosen action without knowledge of the opponent's choice.
- **Resolution**: Actions are revealed and resolved simultaneously according to the game mechanics.
- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players selecting and resolving actions each turn until a win condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Action Details

1. **Charge**
   - **Usage**: Replenish CP when low or to prepare for costly actions.
   - **Limit**: CP cannot exceed 5.
   - **Strategic Note**: Essential for maintaining the ability to perform powerful actions.

2. **Attack**
   - **Usage**: A standard offensive move to chip away at the opponent's CP.
   - **Blocked By**: Shield.
   - **Strategic Note**: Useful for consistent pressure; efficient when the opponent is less likely to Shield.

3. **Special Attack**
   - **Usage**: A heavy offensive move to significantly damage the opponent.
   - **Blocked By**: Shield.
   - **Requirement**: Requires at least 3 CP to perform.
   - **Strategic Note**: High risk and reward; best used when the opponent is unlikely to Shield.

4. **Shield**
   - **Usage**: Defensive maneuver to protect against incoming damage.
   - **Effectiveness**: Blocks all damage from Attack and Special Attack for the turn.
   - **Strategic Note**: Costly if the opponent does not attack; anticipate opponent's moves to use effectively.

### Action Resolution

- **Simultaneous Actions**: Both players' actions are resolved at the same time.
- **CP Adjustments**: Apply the CP cost of actions before resolving their effects.
- **Damage Application**: After CP adjustments, apply any damage to the opponent's CP.
- **Overdraw**: If a player's CP is reduced below zero, it remains at zero for the purpose of determining the game end.

### Victory Conditions

- **Winning the Game**: A player wins when the opponent's CP is reduced to **zero or below** at the end of any turn.
- **Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; it continues until one player's CP reaches zero.

## Scoring

- **Command Points (CP)**: The primary metric tracked throughout the game.
  - **Starting Value**: 5 CP for each player.
  - **Tracking**: Players must keep an accurate record of their own and the opponent's CP after each turn.
- **Damage**: Represents CP lost due to opponent's actions.
  - **Attack Damage**: 1 CP.
  - **Special Attack Damage**: 3 CP.

## Strategic Tips

- **Balance Offense and Defense**: Attacking depletes your CP, so time your attacks wisely.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Anticipate when your opponent might Shield or Charge to optimize your action choice.
- **Manage CP Carefully**: Keep track of both players' CP to plan when to Charge or go for a Special Attack.
- **Avoid Wasting Actions**: Using a Special Attack when the opponent Shields is costly; consider the risk.

## Conclusion

Command Clash is a game of prediction, resource management, and strategy. Players must make calculated decisions each turn, considering both their CP and the opponent's likely actions. With simple rules and deep strategic possibilities, Command Clash offers an engaging and quick gameplay experience in a command-line interface.
