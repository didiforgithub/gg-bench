**Game Name:** Reverse Avoidance

---

**Objective:**

The primary goal of Reverse Avoidance is to force your opponent into creating a number divisible by 7 or leave them with no valid moves. Players take turns manipulating a shared sequence of digits, aiming to avoid sequences that are divisible by 7. The player who causes the sequence to be divisible by 7 on their turn loses the game.

---

**Setup:**

- **Initial Sequence:** The game begins with a shared sequence containing the single digit `'1'`.
- **Starting Player:** Decide which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

---

**Game Components:**

- **Shared Sequence:**
  - A sequence of digits that both players manipulate during their turns.
  - Initially starts as `'1'`.
- **Digits (1-9):**
  - Players can append any single digit from `'1'` to `'9'` to the sequence.
- **Actions:**
  - **Append Digit:** Adding a digit to the end of the current sequence.
  - **Reverse Sequence:** Reversing the order of the digits in the current sequence.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
2. **Player Actions:**
   - On your turn, you must perform **one** of the following actions:
     - **Append a Digit:**
       - Choose any digit from `'1'` to `'9'`.
       - Append this digit to the **end** of the current sequence.
     - **Reverse the Sequence:**
       - Reverse the order of the digits in the current sequence (e.g., `'123'` becomes `'321'`).
3. **Valid Moves:**
   - After your action, the resulting sequence must represent a positive integer **not divisible by 7**.
   - If the sequence is divisible by 7 after your move, you lose.
   - If you have no valid moves that result in a sequence not divisible by 7, you lose.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

- **Sequence Integrity:**
  - The sequence always represents a positive integer without leading zeros.
  - Leading zeros are not allowed (e.g., sequences like `'01'` are invalid).
- **Actions Explained:**
  - **Appending a Digit:**
    - Example: Current sequence is `'123'`.
    - You choose to append `'4'`.
    - New sequence becomes `'1234'`.
  - **Reversing the Sequence:**
    - Example: Current sequence is `'123'`.
    - You choose to reverse it.
    - New sequence becomes `'321'`.
- **Divisibility Check:**
  - At the end of each turn, check if the new sequence is divisible by 7.
    - Use standard division.
    - If divisible, the player who made the move loses.
- **No Skip or Pass:**
  - Players cannot skip their turn; they must perform one of the two actions if possible.
- **Winning the Game:**
  - You win if:
    - Your opponent creates a sequence divisible by 7 on their turn.
    - Your opponent has no valid moves that avoid creating a sequence divisible by 7.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Winning:**
  - The winner is the player who avoids creating a sequence divisible by 7 while forcing their opponent into an impossible position.
- **No Points System:**
  - There is no cumulative scoring; each game is won by achieving the objective.

**Examples:**

*Below are sample turns illustrating how the game is played in a command-line interface.*

---

**Example Game:**

- **Initial Sequence:** `'1'`

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current Sequence:** `'1'`
- **Action:** Append Digit `'2'`
- **Sequence After Move:** `'12'`
- **Divisibility Check:** `12 รท 7 = 1 remainder 5` (Not divisible)
- **Game Continues**

**Command-line Interaction:**

```
Current sequence: 1
Player 1, choose action:
1. Append a digit
2. Reverse the sequence
Enter choice: 1
Enter digit to append (1-9): 2
New sequence: 12
Sequence is not divisible by 7. Next player's turn.
```

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current Sequence:** `'12'`
- **Action:** Reverse the Sequence
- **Sequence After Move:** `'21'`
- **Divisibility Check:** `21 รท 7 = 3` (Divisible)
- **Player 2 Loses**

**Command-line Interaction:**

```
Current sequence: 12
Player 2, choose action:
1. Append a digit
2. Reverse the sequence
Enter choice: 2
New sequence: 21
Sequence is divisible by 7. Player 2 loses!
```

---

**Game Over:**

- **Winner:** Player 1

---

**Extended Example with Strategic Play:**

**Initial Sequence:** `'1'`

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Action:** Append Digit `'4'`
- **Sequence After Move:** `'14'`
- **Divisibility Check:** `14 รท 7 = 2` (Divisible)
- **Player 1 Loses**

**Command-line Interaction:**

```
Current sequence: 1
Player 1, choose action:
1. Append a digit
2. Reverse the sequence
Enter choice: 1
Enter digit to append (1-9): 4
New sequence: 14
Sequence is divisible by 7. Player 1 loses!
```

- **Winner:** Player 2

---

**Strategic Considerations:**

- **Avoid Creating Multiples of 7:**
  - Be cautious when appending digits that may lead to a multiple of 7.
- **Use Reversals Wisely:**
  - Reversing the sequence can drastically change the number; use it to avoid traps or set up the opponent.
- **Predict Opponent's Options:**
  - Anticipate the results of possible moves to force the opponent into a losing position.
  
---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Validity of Moves:**
  - Players must ensure their moves result in valid sequences (no leading zeros, positive integers).
- **Example of Invalid Move:**
  - If the current sequence is `'1'` and a player attempts to reverse it, the sequence remains `'1'`.
  - If `'1'` is not divisible by 7, the move is valid but may not be strategic.
- **No Repetition Restrictions:**
  - Players can use the same action multiple times in the game (e.g., append digits consecutively).

---

**Command-Line Interaction Overview:**

- **Prompting the Player:**
  - Each player is prompted for their action and inputs.
- **Displaying Information:**
  - Current sequence is displayed at the start of each turn.
  - After each move, the new sequence and divisibility result are shown.
- **Handling Invalid Inputs:**
  - The game should handle invalid inputs gracefully, prompting the player to try again.
