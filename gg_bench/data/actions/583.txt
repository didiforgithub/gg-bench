In the game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with three possible actions. Each index in this action space corresponds to a specific move in the game:

- **Index 0**: Represents the action "Strike", which reduces the opponent's Shadow Counter by 1 point unless they have a shield active.
- **Index 1**: Represents the action "Shield", which protects the player's Shadow Counter from being reduced on the opponent's next turn.
- **Index 2**: Represents the action "Drain", which decreases the player's own Shadow Counter by 1 point and the opponent's Shadow Counter by 2 points, provided the player's Shadow Counter is 2 or higher and Drain was not used on the previous turn.
