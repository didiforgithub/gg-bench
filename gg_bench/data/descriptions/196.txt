# Secret Path

## Objective

Be the first player to reach your opponent's base by moving your token along a number line while avoiding hidden traps set by your opponent. Victory is achieved by landing **exactly** on the opponent's starting position without triggering a trap.

---

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A number line with positions numbered from **1** to **15**.
2. **Player Bases**:
   - **Player 1's base** is at position **1**.
   - **Player 2's base** is at position **15**.
3. **Tokens**:
   - Each player has a token that starts on their respective base (Player 1 on position **1**, Player 2 on position **15**).
4. **Traps**:
   - Each player secretly selects **three** different positions between **2** and **14** (inclusive) to place traps. These positions are recorded privately and are not revealed to the opponent.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Line**: Positions numbered from **1** to **15**, representing the path between the two bases.
- **Player Tokens**: Represent the players' positions on the number line.
- **Traps**: Hidden traps set by each player on specific positions of the number line. Traps are only revealed when an opponent lands on them.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players take turns alternately.
   - Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).
2. **Movement**:
   - On your turn, you may move your token **forward** or **backward** along the number line.
   - You may move **1** or **2** positions per turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Movement Range**:
  - Tokens must stay within positions **1** to **15**.
  - You cannot move beyond the number line boundaries.
- **Continuous Movement**:
  - You cannot skip over positions; movement must be to adjacent positions based on your move (1 or 2 steps).

### Encountering Traps

- **Triggering a Trap**:
  - If you land on a position that your opponent has trapped, the trap is sprung.
  - When a trap is sprung:
    - Your token is returned to your **base** (starting position).
    - The position of the trap is now **revealed** and becomes safe for future moves.
- **Passing Over Traps**:
  - If you pass over a trapped position without landing on it, the trap is **not** triggered.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to land **exactly** on the opponent's **base** wins the game.
  - You must plan your moves to land precisely on the opponent's base position (**1** for Player 2, **15** for Player 1).
- **Boundary Rule**:
  - You cannot move beyond the opponent's base; any move that would take you past it is invalid.

### Additional Rules

- **Trap Confidentiality**:
  - Players cannot reveal or change the positions of their traps after they have been set at the beginning of the game.
- **Token Interaction**:
  - If both players' tokens occupy the same position (other than the starting positions), they coexist without any effect on each other.

---

## Scoring

- The game does not use a point-based scoring system.
- **Victory** is achieved by successfully reaching the opponent's base without being sent back by traps.
- There is always a clear winner; no draws are possible.

## Strategy Tips

- **Trap Placement**:
  - Place traps on positions that are likely to be landed upon based on common movement patterns.
  - Consider trapping positions that are exactly 1 or 2 steps away from your opponent's base, as they may make a final move to these positions.

- **Movement Decisions**:
  - Vary your movement to avoid predictable patterns.
  - Occasionally move backward to avoid traps and confuse your opponent.

- **Memory and Observation**:
  - Keep track of revealed traps to plan safe routes.
  - Pay attention to your opponent's movements for clues about trap placements.

- **Risk Management**:
  - Weigh the risk of moving forward rapidly against the possibility of triggering a trap.
  - Sometimes a cautious approach yields better results.
