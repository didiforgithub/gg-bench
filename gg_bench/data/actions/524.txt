The action space indices in the game map to subtraction moves by corresponding to the divisors that can be subtracted from the current score. Specifically, the action index `n` represents subtracting the divisor `n + 2`. This means that action index 0 corresponds to subtracting the divisor 2, index 1 corresponds to subtracting the divisor 3, and so on, up to index 48, which corresponds to subtracting the divisor 50. This mapping allows players to choose a divisor to subtract by selecting its corresponding action index from the action space.
