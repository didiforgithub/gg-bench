The action space is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to MAX_N. Each action represents subtracting a proper divisor from the current value of N. The mapping between action indices and game moves is achieved by interpreting the index as the divisor minus one. Thus, an action index of `i` corresponds to the player choosing to subtract the proper divisor `i + 1` from N. This mapping ensures that actions can be easily translated to the corresponding proper divisors, and it allows for direct computation of valid actions within the defined action space.
