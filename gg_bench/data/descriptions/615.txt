**Command-Line Interaction Sample:**

Here's how a turn might look in a command-line interface:

```
Player 1's Turn
----------------
HP: 9
Blocking Status: Inactive
Choose a spell to cast:
1 - Magic Missile
2 - Fireball
3 - Shield
4 - Heal
5 - Lightning Strike
Enter the number of the spell: 5

Player 1 casts Lightning Strike!
Player 2 is not blocking.
Player 2 takes 4 damage.

Player 2's HP is now 4.
----------------
Press Enter to continue...

Player 2's Turn
----------------
HP: 4
Blocking Status: Inactive
Choose a spell to cast:
1 - Magic Missile
2 - Fireball
3 - Shield
4 - Heal
5 - Lightning Strike
Enter the number of the spell: 4

Player 2 casts Heal!
Player 2 restores 2 HP.

Player 2's HP is now 6.
----------------
Press Enter to continue...
```

Players would continue this interaction until one player's HP reaches zero.

---

**Strategic Depth and Complexity:**

- **Anticipation:** Players must anticipate opponents' moves. For example, using **Shield** before an expected **Lightning Strike**.
- **Resource Management:** Deciding when to heal or attack based on current HP.
- **Bluffing:** A player might avoid blocking to tempt the opponent into using a blockable spell.
- **Risk vs. Reward:** **Spell 5 (Lightning Strike)** deals high damage but can fail if the opponent is blocking.

---

**Conclusion:**

"Dueling Wizards" is a game of strategy, prediction, and timely decision-making. The simple mechanics allow for quick gameplay, while the strategic choices provide depth, ensuring that skilled players can consistently outperform unskilled ones. The absence of a draw mechanism and the straightforward rules make it suitable for a command-line interface and easy to code.
