The action space indices map to moves in the game as follows:

1. **Attack Actions (0-30):** Each action index from 0 to 30 represents a non-empty subset of the cards in the player's hand that can be played to launch an attack. The indices are determined using binary masks to generate all possible subsets.

2. **Defend Actions (31-35):** Indices represent defending by discarding a single card from the player's hand. The action index 31 corresponds to the first card, 32 to the second, and so on, up to 35.

3. **Swap Actions (36-40):** Indices represent swapping a single card from the player's hand with a random card from the opponent's hand. The action index 36 corresponds to swapping the first card, 37 the second, and so forth, up to 40.
