In the given gym environment, the action space indices map to the player's movement options as follows:

- Action `0` corresponds to moving forward by `1` position.
- Action `1` corresponds to moving forward by `2` positions.
- Action `2` corresponds to moving forward by `3` positions.

This mapping directly translates the discrete actions into the allowed movement distances in the game.
