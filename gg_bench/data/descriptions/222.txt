# Game Name: Number Harmony

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
In *Number Harmony*, two players take turns adding single-digit numbers (from 1 to 9) to a shared sequence. The objective is to **avoid creating a sequence where any three consecutive digits sum to 15**. The player who **adds a digit that causes any three consecutive digits to sum to 15 loses** the game. There are no draws in this game; play continues until one player loses according to the rules.

## Setup

- **Starting Condition:**  
  - The game begins with an **empty sequence**.
- **Players:**  
  - Two players, **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
  - Player 1 makes the **first move**.

---

## Game Components

- **Digits (1-9):**  
  - These are the numbers players can choose from on their turn.
  - Each digit can be used **multiple times** throughout the game.
- **Shared Sequence:**  
  - A sequence that both players contribute to by adding digits.
  - The sequence grows as players take turns.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**

  1. **Select a Digit:**  
     - On their turn, a player selects any **single-digit number between 1 and 9** (inclusive).
  2. **Add to Sequence:**  
     - The chosen digit is appended to the **end of the shared sequence**.
  3. **Check for Sum to 15:**  
     - After the digit is added, check if **any three consecutive digits** in the sequence sum to **15**.
     - **Important:** This check includes **all sets of three consecutive digits**, not just the last three added.
  4. **Determine Outcome:**  
     - If the addition of the digit results in any three consecutive digits summing to 15, the **player who made the move loses**.
     - If not, the turn passes to the **other player**.

- **Turn Progression:**
  - Players **alternate turns** until the game ends according to the rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules:

1. **Digit Selection:**
   - Players may choose **any digit from 1 to 9** on their turn.
   - There are **no restrictions** on how many times a digit can be used in the sequence.

2. **Building the Sequence:**
   - Digits are **appended** to the existing sequence.
   - The sequence is a continuous list of digits, growing with each turn.

3. **Sum to 15 Rule:**
   - After each move, check the entire sequence for **any instance where three consecutive digits sum to 15**.
   - If such an instance is found, the player who just played **loses the game**.

4. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players **cannot skip** their turn.
   - A valid digit **must** be played if possible.

5. **Game End:**
   - The game ends immediately when a player loses according to the **Sum to 15 Rule**.
   - There is **no draw** condition.

### Special Notes:

- **Strategic Play:**
  - Players must think ahead to avoid setting up the sequence in a way that forces them to lose on subsequent turns.
  - Observing the existing sequence and calculating possible sums is crucial.

- **Examples of Three Consecutive Digits Summing to 15:**
  - **[4][5][6]**: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
  - **[7][8][0]**: 7 + 8 + 0 = 15 (note that 0 cannot be played, but for the sake of example)
  - **[9][4][2]**: 9 + 4 + 2 = 15

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The game is won by the player who **avoids creating** a sequence where any three consecutive digits sum to 15.
  
- **Losing the Game:**
  - A player **loses** by adding a digit that results in any three consecutive digits in the sequence summing to 15.

- **No Points System:**
  - *Number Harmony* does not utilize a points system; victory is determined solely by the game's objective.

## Examples

### Example Game

Let's illustrate how *Number Harmony* is played through a sample game between Player 1 and Player 2.

#### Initial State:
- Sequence: (empty)

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action:** Selects and adds **5** to the sequence.
- **Sequence after move:** [5]
- **Check for Sum to 15:** Not applicable (less than three digits).
- **Outcome:** Game continues.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action:** Selects and adds **7** to the sequence.
- **Sequence after move:** [5][7]
- **Check for Sum to 15:** Not applicable (less than three digits).
- **Outcome:** Game continues.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action:** Selects and adds **2** to the sequence.
- **Sequence after move:** [5][7][2]
- **Check for Sum to 15:**
  - Sum of last three digits: 5 + 7 + 2 = 14
- **Outcome:** Game continues.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action:** Selects and adds **6** to the sequence.
- **Sequence after move:** [5][7][2][6]
- **Check for Sum to 15:**
  - Sum of digits 7 + 2 + 6 = 15
- **Result:** Player 2 **loses** the game.
  - The three consecutive digits [7][2][6] sum to 15.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a simulated command-line interaction between the two players.

#### Start of Game:

```
Welcome to Number Harmony!

Player 1, it's your turn.
Current sequence: 
Please select a digit (1-9): 5
```

#### After Player 1's Move:

```
Player 1 added 5 to the sequence.
Current sequence: [5]
No three consecutive digits to check.
Player 2, it's your turn.
Please select a digit (1-9): 7
```

#### After Player 2's Move:

```
Player 2 added 7 to the sequence.
Current sequence: [5][7]
No three consecutive digits to check.
Player 1, it's your turn.
Please select a digit (1-9): 2
```

#### After Player 1's Move:

```
Player 1 added 2 to the sequence.
Current sequence: [5][7][2]
Checking sums of three consecutive digits...
Sum of [5][7][2] = 14
No sum equals 15. Game continues.
Player 2, it's your turn.
Please select a digit (1-9): 6
```

#### After Player 2's Move:

```
Player 2 added 6 to the sequence.
Current sequence: [5][7][2][6]
Checking sums of three consecutive digits...
Sum of [5][7][2] = 14
Sum of [7][2][6] = 15
Player 2 has created a sum of 15 with digits [7][2][6].
Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:**  
  Consider how your chosen digit will affect not only the current state but potential future sums.

- **Avoid Setting Traps for Yourself:**  
  Be cautious of sequences that could force you into a losing position on your next turn.

- **Monitor the Sequence:**  
  Keep track of the last two digits in the sequence before your turn to avoid completing a sum of 15.

- **Force Your Opponent's Hand:**  
  If possible, play in a way that limits your opponent's safe options.
