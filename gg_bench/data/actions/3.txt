In the Gridlock game, the action space indices in the `CustomEnv` environment correspond to cells on the 5x5 grid in a flattened manner. The grid is represented as a single array with indices ranging from 0 to 24. The mapping between an action index and a grid cell is as follows:

- Action indices 0 to 4 correspond to grid cells A1 to A5.
- Action indices 5 to 9 correspond to grid cells B1 to B5.
- Action indices 10 to 14 correspond to grid cells C1 to C5.
- Action indices 15 to 19 correspond to grid cells D1 to D5.
- Action indices 20 to 24 correspond to grid cells E1 to E5.

The index can be converted to grid coordinates by calculating `row = index // 5` and `column = index % 5`, with rows labeled A to E (0 to 4) and columns numbered 1 to 5 (1 to 5).
