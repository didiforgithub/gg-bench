In the game environment, the action space consists of indices from 0 to 99, each corresponding to the numbers 1 to 100 in the game. An action index \( i \) maps to the move of selecting the number \( i+1 \). This mapping enables actions to directly represent the selection of any valid number within the 1-100 range in the game.
