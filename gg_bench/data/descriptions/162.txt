**Number Chain Duel**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to complete your number chain when the opponent cannot make a valid move. Utilize strategic selection of numbers to extend your chain while limiting your opponent's options. The game ends when a player cannot add a valid number to their chain, resulting in their loss.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9**.
2. **Chains**: Each player starts with an **empty chain**.
3. **Player Order**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a simple random method like flipping a coin.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**:
  - A set of numbers: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**.
  - Numbers are **removed** from the pool once selected and cannot be used again by either player.
- **Player Chains**:
  - Each player maintains their own sequence of numbers known as a **chain**.
  - Chains begin **empty** and grow as players add numbers during their turns.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose a valid number from the **Number Pool**.
  2. **Add to Chain**: Append the selected number to the **end** of your chain.
  3. **Update Number Pool**: Remove the selected number from the **Number Pool**.
- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players taking turns until a player cannot make a valid move.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Number Selection**:
   - If your chain is **empty**, you may select **any** number from the Number Pool.
2. **Adding Numbers to Chain**:
   - The number you select must be a **factor** or a **multiple** of the **last number** in your chain.
     - **Factor**: A number that divides evenly into the last number.
     - **Multiple**: A number that the last number divides evenly into.
3. **Valid Moves**:
   - You **must** select a number that meets the factor or multiple rule.
   - If there is no valid number available, you **lose** the game.
4. **Number Usage**:
   - Once a number is selected by either player, it is **removed** from the Number Pool and cannot be selected again.
5. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player **wins** when their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.

### **Scoring**

- **Win Condition**: The game is a **win-or-lose** scenario with no points or draws.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of **wins** to determine an overall winner after a set number of games.
