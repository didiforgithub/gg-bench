In the action space, indices 0 to 8 correspond to the addition operations, where each index maps to adding a number from 1 to 9, respectively. For example, index 0 maps to adding 1, index 1 maps to adding 2, and so on, up to index 8 which maps to adding 9.

Indices 9 to 12 correspond to the multiplication operations, where each index maps to multiplying the current number by an integer from 2 to 5. Specifically, index 9 maps to multiplying by 2, index 10 maps to multiplying by 3, index 11 maps to multiplying by 4, and index 12 maps to multiplying by 5.
