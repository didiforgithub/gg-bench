# Number Split Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Be the player who forces your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move by strategically splitting numbers.** The primary goal is to make the opponent unable to split the given number according to the game rules on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number (N):**
   - Agree upon a positive integer **N** to start the game. For a quick and engaging game, choose a number between **15 and 25**.
   - Example: `N = 16`

2. **Player Order:**
   - Decide who will take the first turn. This can be done randomly or by mutual agreement.
   - Players will be referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

3. **Command-Line Interface:**
   - The game is played in a command-line environment.
   - Keep track of the current number **N** and display it at the start of each turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number (N):**
  - A positive integer that players manipulate during the game.
  - No physical components are required; everything is tracked via the command line.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  - Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
  - On each turn, the active player performs the following steps:
    1. **View the Current Number (N):**
       - The game displays the current value of **N**.
    2. **Determine Possible Splits:**
       - List all possible ways to split **N** into two unequal positive integers greater than zero that sum to **N**.
    3. **Choose a Split:**
       - Select one valid split from the list.
    4. **Select the New N:**
       - Choose one of the two numbers from the split to become the new **N** for the next player.
    5. **Display Move:**
       - Announce the chosen split and the new **N**.

- **Progression of Turns:**
  - After completing the steps, the turn passes to the other player.
  - The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Splitting:**

   - **On Your Turn:**
     - You must split the current number **N** into **two unequal positive integers greater than zero** that sum up to **N**.
     - **Equal splits are not allowed.** For example, splitting 8 into 4 and 4 is invalid.
     - **All resulting numbers must be positive integers.** Zero or negative numbers are not permitted.

   - **Example Valid Splits:**
     - If `N = 9`, valid splits include `(8,1)`, `(7,2)`, `(6,3)`, `(5,4)`.

2. **Choosing the New N:**

   - After splitting, you must select **one** of the two numbers from your split to be the new **N** for your opponent's next turn.

   - **Strategic Selection:**
     - Choose the new **N** carefully to limit your opponent's options.

3. **Winning the Game:**

   - **Unable to Split:**
     - If a player cannot make a valid split on their turn because no unequal positive integers sum up to the current **N**, they lose the game.
     - The last player to make a valid move wins.

4. **Mandatory Moves:**

   - **No Passing:**
     - Players must make a valid move if one is available.
     - Skipping a turn or passing is not allowed.

5. **Integrity of the Game:**

   - **Honesty in Calculation:**
     - Players should accurately determine all possible splits.
     - Misrepresenting available moves is against the rules.

## Scoring

- **Victory Conditions:**
  - The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot perform a valid split wins the game.

- **No Draws:**
  - The game cannot end in a tie; play continues until one player wins according to the rules.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting N:** `16`

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** `16`
- **Possible Splits:** `(15,1)`, `(14,2)`, `(13,3)`, `(12,4)`, `(11,5)`, `(10,6)`, `(9,7)`, `(8,8)` (Note: `(8,8)` is invalid because the numbers are equal.)
- **Player 1 Chooses Split:** `10` and `6`
- **Selects New N:** `6` for Player 2
- **Announces Move:**
  ```
  Player 1 splits 16 into 10 and 6.
  Player 1 selects N = 6 for Player 2.
  ```

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current N:** `6`
- **Possible Splits:** `(5,1)`, `(4,2)` (Note: `(3,3)` is invalid as the numbers are equal.)
- **Player 2 Chooses Split:** `5` and `1`
- **Selects New N:** `5` for Player 1
- **Announces Move:**
  ```
  Player 2 splits 6 into 5 and 1.
  Player 2 selects N = 5 for Player 1.
  ```

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** `5`
- **Possible Splits:** `(4,1)` (Only valid split.)
- **Player 1 Chooses Split:** `4` and `1`
- **Selects New N:** `4` for Player 2
- **Announces Move:**
  ```
  Player 1 splits 5 into 4 and 1.
  Player 1 selects N = 4 for Player 2.
  ```

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current N:** `4`
- **Possible Splits:** `(3,1)` (Only valid split.)
- **Player 2 Chooses Split:** `3` and `1`
- **Selects New N:** `1` for Player 1
- **Announces Move:**
  ```
  Player 2 splits 4 into 3 and 1.
  Player 2 selects N = 1 for Player 1.
  ```

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** `1`
- **Possible Splits:** None (Cannot split 1 into two unequal positive integers.)
- **Player 1 Cannot Make a Valid Move**

  ```
  Player 1 cannot make a valid move.
  Player 2 wins the game!
  ```

- Possible Splits: (4,1)
- Choose a split: 4 and 1
- Select new N for Player 2: 4
- Output: "Player 1 splits 5 into 4 and 1. New N for Player 2 is 4."

Player 2's Turn:
- Current N: 4
- Possible Splits: (3,1)
- Choose a split: 3 and 1
- Select new N for Player 1: 1
- Output: "Player 2 splits 4 into 3 and 1. New N for Player 1 is 1."

Player 1's Turn:

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Before making a move, consider the possible splits your opponent will have.
  - Aim to leave your opponent with numbers that have limited or no valid splits.

- **Control the Game:**
  - Try to steer the game toward smaller numbers where your strategic advantage increases.
  - Be cautious when splitting larger numbers; giving the opponent a small N may backfire if they can manipulate it against you.

- **Avoid Equal Opportunities:**
  - Do not leave an N that provides your opponent with the same strategic options you just had.
  - For example, avoid selecting N that is just slightly smaller than previous N unless it limits their moves.

- **Force Unwinnable Positions:**
  - If possible, create a sequence where no matter what the opponent does, they will eventually run out of valid moves.
