# Prime Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach a cumulative total score of exactly **50**. Utilize strategic decisions to manage your score, capitalize on prime number bonuses, and outmaneuver your opponent to achieve victory.

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players are needed to play Prime Duel.
2. **Starting Scores**: Both players start with a score of **0**.
3. **Deck Preparation**:
   - A virtual deck is created consisting of cards numbered **1** to **10**.
   - There are **four copies** of each card number, resulting in a total of **40 cards**.
   - The deck is **shuffled** thoroughly at the start of the game.

## Game Components

### Virtual Deck

- **Cards**: Numbered from **1** to **10**.
- **Quantity**: Four of each number (e.g., four `1`s, four `2`s, ..., four `10`s).
- **Total Cards**: **40**.
- **Representation**: In a command-line interface, cards are represented by their numerical value when drawn (e.g., `Card drawn: 7`).

### Scores

- **Player Scores**: Each player has an individual cumulative score starting at **0**.
- **Target Score**: The goal is to reach exactly **50**.

### Prime Numbers

- **Prime Numbers up to 50**: `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47`.
- **Prime Bonus**: Landing on a prime cumulative score grants an extra turn.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Draw a Card**: The player draws the **top card** from the deck.
2. **Decision Phase**:
   - **Keep**: Add the card's value to your cumulative score.
   - **Discard**: Reject the first card and draw a second card, which **must be kept**.
3. **Score Update**: Update your cumulative score based on the card kept.
4. **Prime Check**:
   - If the new cumulative score is a **prime number**, the player receives an **extra turn**.
   - If not, the turn passes to the opponent.
5. **Win Condition Check**: If a player reaches a cumulative score of exactly **50**, they win the game.

### Turn Progression

- **Normal Play**: Players alternate turns unless an extra turn is earned.
- **Extra Turns**: A player may have multiple consecutive turns if they land on prime cumulative scores each time.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Card Drawing and Decisions

- **First Draw**: On each turn, draw the top card from the deck.
- **Keep or Discard**:
  - **Keep**: Choose to add the card's value to your score.
  - **Discard**: Opt to discard the first card and **automatically** keep the second draw.
- **Mandatory Second Keep**: If you discard the first card, you **must** keep the second card, regardless of its value.

### Score Management

- **Not Exceeding 50**:
  - If keeping a card would cause your cumulative score to exceed **50**, you **cannot keep** that card.
  - In this case, you must discard it and draw a second card, which you must keep.
  - If the second card also causes the score to exceed 50, it is discarded, and your turn ends without increasing your score.

### Prime Bonus

- **Extra Turn Conditions**:
  - After adding a card's value, check if your new cumulative score is a **prime number**.
  - If it is, you earn an **extra turn** immediately.
- **Consecutive Primes**:
  - It's possible to earn multiple extra turns by consecutively landing on prime numbers.

### Deck Depletion

- **Reshuffling**:
  - If the deck runs out of cards before a player reaches 50, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Scoring

- **Cumulative Score Tracking**: Each player keeps a running total of their scores after each turn.
- **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach a cumulative score of exactly **50** wins.
- **Prohibited Scores**: Players cannot exceed a cumulative score of **50**.
