In the game environment, the action space is discrete with three indices representing possible moves. The mappings are as follows: action index `0` corresponds to moving `1` step forward, action index `1` corresponds to moving `2` steps forward, and action index `2` corresponds to moving `3` steps forward. Each action index allows the player to advance a specified number of cells on the grid.
