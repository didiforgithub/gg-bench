**Number Tower**

---

### **Objective**

Become the first player to successfully build a three-level Number Tower by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool. Each level of your tower must contain a number smaller than the one below it, adhering to the descending order rule. The first player to complete their tower following these rules wins the game.

### **Setup**

1. **Player Preparation**: Two players are required. Decide who will be Player 1 and Player 2.
2. **Tower Structure**: Each player has an empty tower with three levels:
   - **Level 1 (Bottom)**
   - **Level 2 (Middle)**
   - **Level 3 (Top)**
3. **Number Pool**:
   - A shared pool of numbers ranging from **1 to 9**.
   - Each number from **1 to 9** is available in **unlimited quantity** for simplicity.
4. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Both players' towers are empty at the start of the game.
   - The number pool contains numbers **1** through **9** available for selection.

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**: A collection of numbers from **1** to **9**.
- **Player Towers**: Each player has a personal tower with three levels to fill.
- **Levels**:
  - **Level 1 (Bottom)**: The foundation of the tower.
  - **Level 2 (Middle)**: Placed above Level 1.
  - **Level 3 (Top)**: The final level at the top.

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  - **Select a Number**: Choose any number from **1** to **9** from the number pool.
  - **Place the Number**: Place the selected number on the **lowest available level** of your tower.
- **Turn Progression**: After placing a number, the turn passes to the other player.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can choose any number between **1** and **9**, regardless of previous selections.
   - Numbers are **not removed** from the pool upon selection; they remain available for both players.
2. **Placement Rules**:
   - **Level 1 (Bottom)**:
     - Can be any number from **1** to **9**.
   - **Level 2 (Middle)**:
     - Must be **less than** the number on Level 1.
   - **Level 3 (Top)**:
     - Must be **less than** the number on Level 2.
3. **Descending Order Requirement**:
   - The tower must have numbers in **strict descending order** from bottom to top (e.g., 7 > 5 > 2).
4. **Valid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot place a number due to the descending order rule, they **forfeit their turn**.
5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to **successfully complete all three levels** of their tower following the placement rules wins.
6. **Forfeiting**:
   - If a player makes an **invalid move** (e.g., places a number not less than the one below), they **must undo** the move and **forfeit their turn**.

### **Scoring**

- **Winning Condition**:
  - Successfully build a three-level tower with numbers in strict descending order.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use points; victory is achieved by meeting the objective first.

### **Examples**

#### **Sample Gameplay**

**Initial State**:

- Both towers are empty.
- Number Pool: Numbers **1** through **9** are available.

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Selects **number 7**.
  - Places **7** on **Level 1** (Bottom) of their tower.
- **Player 1's Tower**:
  - Level 1: **7**
  - Level 2: Empty
  - Level 3: Empty

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Selects **number 8**.
  - Places **8** on **Level 1** (Bottom) of their tower.
- **Player 2's Tower**:
  - Level 1: **8**
  - Level 2: Empty
  - Level 3: Empty

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Selects **number 5**.
  - Since **5** is less than **7** (Level 1), places **5** on **Level 2** (Middle).
- **Player 1's Tower**:
  - Level 1: **7**
  - Level 2: **5**
  - Level 3: Empty

**Turn 4**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Selects **number 9**.
  - Attempts to place **9** on **Level 2** (Middle).
  - **Invalid Move**: **9** is not less than **8** (Level 1).
  - **Action**: Cannot place **9**, forfeits turn.

**Turn 5**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Selects **number 3**.
  - Since **3** is less than **5** (Level 2), places **3** on **Level 3** (Top).
- **Player 1's Tower**:
  - Level 1: **7**
  - Level 2: **5**
  - Level 3: **3**

**Result**:

- **Player 1** has successfully built a tower in strict descending order (**7 > 5 > 3**).
- **Player 1 wins** the game.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Think about the numbers you will need for upper levels before choosing your base number.
- **Avoid High Base Numbers**: Choosing a very high number for Level 1 may limit your options for Levels 2 and 3.
- **Watch Your Opponent**: Pay attention to your opponent's choices to anticipate their potential moves.
- **Flexible Choices**: Opt for middle-range numbers on lower levels to keep more options open for higher levels.
- **Avoid Invalid Moves**: Double-check that your selected number is less than the one below to prevent forfeiting your turn.
