In the gym environment for the Bit Flip Showdown game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(8)`, which means there are 8 possible actions numbered from 0 to 7. Each action corresponds directly to flipping a bit at a specific position in the sequence of 8 bits, where action 0 flips bit 1, action 1 flips bit 2, and so on up to action 7, which flips bit 8. This mapping ensures that each action uniquely corresponds to changing the state of one specific bit in the game.
