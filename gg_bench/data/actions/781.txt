In the action space of the `CustomEnv`, each index corresponds to a specific move in the game:

- **Indices 0 to N-1**: These indices represent flipping a single bit at the respective position. For example, index 0 corresponds to flipping the first bit, index 1 corresponds to flipping the second bit, and so on up to the (N-1)-th index.

- **Indices N to (2N-2)**: These indices represent flipping two adjacent bits starting at the respective position. For instance, index N means flipping the first and second bits, index N+1 means flipping the second and third bits, continuing up to index (2N-2), which corresponds to flipping the (N-1)-th and N-th bits.

This mapping allows players to choose their actions based on indices in the discrete action space according to the game rules.
