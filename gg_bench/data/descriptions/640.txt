- **Loss:** Your opponent reaches the sum of **30** before you do.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization:**
   - Create a shared pool containing numbers from **1** to **20**.
   - All numbers are available at the start of the game.

2. **Player Preparation:**
   - Each player has an empty collection at the beginning.
   - Decide who will take the first turn (can be random or by agreement).

3. **Starting Conditions:**
   - Both players begin with a total sum of **0** in their collections.
   - The target sum to reach is **30**.

## Game Components

1. **Shared Number Pool:**
   - **Numbers:** Integers from **1** to **20**.
   - **Availability:** Once a number is selected by a player, it is removed from the pool.

2. **Player Collections:**
   - Each player has their own collection where they accumulate selected numbers.
   - The collection keeps track of the numbers chosen and the current total sum.

3. **Sum Tracker:**
   - **Function:** Keeps track of the total sum of numbers in each player's collection.
   - **Visibility:** Both players can view each other's total sums, but not the individual numbers if secrecy is preferred.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - On each turn, a player must perform the following actions:
     - **Action Phase:** Select one available number from the shared pool.
     - **Collection Update:** Add the selected number to their collection.
     - **Pool Update:** Remove the selected number from the shared pool.

2. **Turn Progression:**
   - After a player completes their turn, the next player proceeds with their turn.
   - The game continues in this alternating fashion until a win condition is met.

3. **Turn Actions:**
   - **Selection Constraints:**
     - A player cannot select a number if adding it to their total sum would exceed **30**.
     - If no valid numbers are available to select, the player must pass their turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection:**
   - **Valid Choices:** Players can choose any number from the shared pool that does not cause their total sum to exceed **30**.
   - **Invalid Choices:** If adding all available numbers would exceed **30**, the player must pass.

2. **Total Sum Calculation:**
   - After each selection, the new total sum of the player's collection is calculated.
   - The total sum is the accumulation of all numbers the player has selected.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Exact Match Required:** A player must reach exactly **30** to win.
   - **Overshooting Prohibited:** If a player's total sum exceeds **30**, they lose immediately.
   - **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite number of combinations to reach **30** within the constraints.

4. **Blocking Mechanic:**
   - Players can strategically select numbers that they anticipate the opponent may need.
   - This adds a layer of strategy, allowing skilled players to control the flow of the game.

5. **Passing a Turn:**
   - If a player cannot make a valid move without exceeding **30**, they must pass.
   - The opponent continues to play until they can reach **30** or also have to pass.

6. **End of Game Conditions:**
   - **Victory:** First player to reach a total sum of **30** wins.
   - **Defeat by Overshooting:** If a player's total sum exceeds **30**, they lose immediately.
   - **Forced Passing:** If both players must pass consecutively without reaching **30**, the player with the total sum closest to **30** wins.

## Scoring

- **Winning Player:** Achieves a total sum of exactly **30** in their collection.
- **Losing Player:** Fails to reach **30** before the opponent or exceeds **30**.
- **No Points System:** The game is won by meeting the objective, not by accumulating points.
- **Tracking Progress:** Players keep track of their total sums throughout the game to strategize their next moves.
