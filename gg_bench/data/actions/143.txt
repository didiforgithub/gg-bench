In the provided gym environment, the action space is represented by discrete indices ranging from 0 to the initial value of \( N \) (inclusive). However, valid game moves correspond only to the proper divisors of the current value of \( N \). Each index in the action space hypothetically represents a divisor, but only those indices that match the actual proper divisors of \( N \) correspond to valid game moves. When a player selects an action index, it represents their choice to subtract the associated divisor from \( N \) if it is a valid move. The environment enforces valid moves by checking if the chosen action index corresponds to a proper divisor of the current \( N \).
