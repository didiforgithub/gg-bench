In the gym environment for Quantum Clash, the action space indices map to game moves as follows:

- **Index 0**: Pass the turn without any action.
- **Indices 1-9**: Influence nodes in the 3x3 grid. Specifically, each index corresponds to a grid node:
  - Index 1 corresponds to node A1,
  - Index 2 to node A2,
  - ..., 
  - upto Index 9 corresponds to node C3.
- **Indices 10-18**: Collapse nodes in the 3x3 grid. Specifically, each index corresponds to a grid node:
  - Index 10 corresponds to node A1,
  - Index 11 to node A2,
  - ..., 
  - upto Index 18 corresponds to node C3. 

Each player action involves influencing or collapsing a specific node, or choosing to pass.
