# Safecracker Duel Rule Book

## Objective

The objective of **Safecracker Duel** is to be the first player to set the shared safe's combination to match your own secret three-digit code. Players take turns changing one digit of the safe's current combination. The first player to align the safe's combination with their secret code wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Secret Code Selection**:
   - Each player privately selects a secret three-digit code.
   - Each digit must be an integer from **1** to **5**, inclusive.
   - Example of a valid code: `3-5-2`.

2. **Initial Safe Combination**:
   - The game begins with the safe's combination set to `1-1-1`.

3. **Determine Player Order**:
   - Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or agreement).

---

## Game Components

- **Secret Codes**:
  - Three-digit codes chosen by each player, kept hidden from the opponent.
  - Digits range from **1** to **5**.

- **Safe Combination**:
  - A shared three-digit combination that is visible to both players.
  - Starts at `1-1-1` and changes as players take their turns.

- **Turns**:
  - Players alternate turns, making moves according to the game rules.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - On a player's turn, they must:
    1. **Select a Digit Position**: Choose one of the three positions in the safe's combination (first, second, or third digit).
    2. **Change the Digit**: Replace the selected digit with any number from **1** to **5** (inclusive).

- **Rules During a Turn**:
  - **Only One Digit**: Players can change **exactly one digit** per turn.
  - **Digit Values**: The new digit can be any valid number, regardless of its current value.
  - **No Passing**: Players cannot skip their turn; a move must be made.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Changing the Safe Combination**:
   - Players modify the safe's combination by changing one digit at a time on their turn.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins immediately when the safe's combination **exactly matches** their secret code (all digits in the correct positions).
   - The match must occur **after** the player has completed their turn.

3. **First Turn Limitation**:
   - A player cannot set the safe's combination to their secret code on their **first turn** of the game.
   - This ensures both players have at least one opportunity to play.

4. **Secret Code Confidentiality**:
   - Players must keep their secret codes hidden from their opponent until the game ends.
   - Revealing your code prematurely is not allowed.

5. **Honesty Policy**:
   - If the safe's combination matches a player's secret code at the end of any turn, that player must declare victory immediately.

6. **Game Continuation**:
   - If neither player has won, the game continues with the next player's turn.
