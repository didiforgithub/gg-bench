# Last Digit Duel

## Objective

**Be the player to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.** In *Last Digit Duel*, players take turns selecting numbers based on specific rules. The primary goal is to strategically choose numbers that limit your opponent's options, ultimately preventing them from making a move on their turn, which constitutes a win for you.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization**: Create a shared list of integers from **1** to **100**. This list represents the available numbers that players can choose from during the game.
2. **Determine First Player**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done through mutual agreement or by a simple random method such as flipping a coin.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list of numbers ranging from **1** to **100**. These numbers are the central elements of the game.
- **Player Turns**: Two players engage in alternating turns, selecting numbers from the number pool based on the game's rules.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played in a command-line environment where players input their chosen numbers, and the game displays necessary information for each turn.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Current Player's Move**:
   - The player selects an available number from the number pool that satisfies the selection criteria outlined in the rules.
   - The chosen number is then removed from the number pool.
2. **Display Updates**:
   - The game updates and displays the last number played.
   - The game shows the remaining numbers in the number pool (optional for added difficulty).
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The turn passes to the next player, who now becomes the current player.

### Order of Actions

- **First Turn**:
  - The first player can select any number from **1** to **100** as there is no previous number.
- **Subsequent Turns**:
  - Each player must select a number whose first digit matches the last digit of the number previously chosen by their opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On their turn, a player must select an available number from the number pool.
   - The first digit of the chosen number must match the last digit of the number selected in the previous turn by the opponent.
2. **Validity of Moves**:
   - If a player cannot find a valid number to choose (i.e., no numbers in the pool satisfy the selection criteria), they lose the game.
   - If a player makes an invalid move (selects a number that doesn't meet the criteria or is no longer in the pool), they forfeit their turn (optional rule) or lose the game (strict rule).
3. **Number Usage**:
   - Numbers, once selected, are removed from the number pool and cannot be used again by either player.

### Special Conditions

- **Leading Zeros**:
  - Numbers do not have leading zeros. For example, the number **07** is considered **7**.
- **Single-Digit Numbers**:
  - For single-digit numbers, the first and last digit are the same.

### Interaction Between Components

- The game relies on the sequence of numbers chosen. Each move directly influences the opponent's options.
- Players must pay attention to both the available numbers and the potential numbers that their opponent could play in response.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **No Point System**:
  - The game does not track points. Victory is achieved by strategic number selection leading to the opponent's inability to play.

- **Control the Ending Digit**: Selecting numbers that end with less common starting digits (like 0) can limit your opponent's options.
- **Number Awareness**: Keep track of which numbers have been played to avoid selecting numbers that give your opponent an advantage.
- **Force Moves**: Whenever possible, choose numbers that will force your opponent to select from a limited set of numbers.
