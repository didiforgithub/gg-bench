# Number Line Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to **capture your opponent's token** by landing on it, or **reach your opponent's base position** without being captured. Success requires strategic movement and anticipation of your opponent's actions.

## Setup

1. **Number Line Creation**: Draw a number line with positions labeled from **0** to **10**.
2. **Player Assignment**:
   - **Player 1**: Starts at **position 0** (left end of the line), which is their base.
   - **Player 2**: Starts at **position 10** (right end of the line), which is their base.
3. **Token Placement**: Each player places their token on their respective base positions.

## Game Components

- **Number Line**: A linear arrangement of numbered positions from **0** to **10**.
- **Tokens**: Two distinct tokens representing each player (e.g., `A` for Player 1 and `B` for Player 2).
  - **Appearance**: Simple text characters or symbols in the command-line interface.
  - **Functionality**: Move along the number line according to the rules.
- **Positions**: Numerical markers indicating each spot on the line.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  1. Decide on the **direction** of movement:
     - **Forward**: Towards the opponent's base.
     - **Backward**: Towards your own base.
  2. Choose to move your token **1 or 2 positions** in the chosen direction.
- **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their move, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - Players may move **either forward or backward** on their turn.
   - Movement must be **1 or 2 positions**; you cannot skip your turn or move zero positions.
   - **Example Moves**:
     - From position `3`, you can move to positions `1`, `2`, `4`, or `5`.
   - Tokens **cannot move beyond** the number line (positions less than `0` or greater than `10` are invalid).
2. **Capturing the Opponent's Token**:
   - If you land on the **same position** as your opponent's token, you **capture** it and **win immediately**.
   - **Example**: If Player 1 moves to position `5` where Player 2 is located, Player 1 captures Player 2's token.
3. **Winning by Reaching the Opponent's Base**:
   - If you reach the opponent's **base position** (Player 1 reaching position `10` or Player 2 reaching position `0`) without being captured, you **win the game**.
4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Anticipate your opponent's moves to avoid being captured.
   - Balance between advancing towards the opponent's base and protecting your own token.
5. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Capture Victory**: Capturing the opponent's token.
   - **Base Victory**: Reaching the opponent's base position without being captured.

## Scoring

- The game does not involve point tracking.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who first **captures the opponent's token** or **reaches the opponent's base** position **wins**.
- There are **no draws**; the game continues until one player wins.

## Strategic Tips

- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Try to anticipate where your opponent might move to avoid being captured.
- **Control the Center**: Occupying central positions can give you more flexibility in movement.
- **Balancing Act**: Decide when to advance towards the opponent's base and when to retreat to avoid capture.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into a position where they have limited safe moves.

## Conclusion

Number Line Duel is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent. With clear rules and straightforward mechanics, it is easy to play in a command-line interface and provides depth for skilled players to consistently triumph over unskilled ones.

Enjoy the duel, and may the best strategist win!
