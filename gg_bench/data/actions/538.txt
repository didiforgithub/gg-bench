In the provided gym environment for the game "Number Chain," the action space is represented as a discrete space with 9 actions, corresponding to the integers 1 through 9. The action index `a` in this discrete space is mapped to the move `n` as `n = a + 1`. This means that action index 0 corresponds to the move 1, action index 1 corresponds to the move 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which corresponds to the move 9. This mapping allows players to select moves based on indices within the action space, which directly correlate to the numbers 1 to 9 used in the game.
