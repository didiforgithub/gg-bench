# Blockade - Game Rule Book

## Objective

**Blockade** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a linear board. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move. Players achieve victory by strategically claiming positions and blocking their opponent's options, ultimately forcing the opponent into a position where they have no available moves, thus constituting a win for the last player who made a move.

---

## Setup

- **Game Board**: The game is played on a linear board consisting of **13 consecutive positions** numbered from **1 to 13**.
- **Starting Condition**: All positions are initially **unclaimed** and **unblocked**.
- **Player Markers**: Each player uses a unique marker to represent claimed positions:
  - **Player 1**: `X`
  - **Player 2**: `O`
- **Blocked Positions**: Blocked positions are represented with a dash `-`.

---

## Game Components

- **Positions**: Numbers **1** through **13** represent the positions on the board.
- **Markers**:
  - **`X`**: Indicates a position claimed by **Player 1**.
  - **`O`**: Indicates a position claimed by **Player 2**.
  - **`-`**: Indicates a position that has been **blocked** and is unavailable to both players.
- **Board Visualization**: The board is displayed as a sequence of numbers and markers to represent the current state.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: 
  - **Player 1** takes the first turn.
  - Players alternate turns thereafter.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Available Positions**: At the start of each turn, the game displays all available (unclaimed and unblocked) positions.
  2. **Player Action**: The current player selects one available position to claim.
  3. **Update Board**:
     - The selected position is marked with the player's marker (`X` or `O`).
     - Adjacent positions are blocked (marked with `-`).
  4. **Check for Available Moves**: If the opponent has no available moves, the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Claiming Positions**:
   - On your turn, you **must** claim **one** available position by entering its corresponding number.
   - The position must be **unclaimed** and **unblocked**.

2. **Blocking Mechanics**:
   - After claiming a position, the game automatically **blocks the adjacent positions**:
     - If you claim position `n`, positions `n-1` and `n+1` (if they exist) become blocked.
     - Blocked positions are marked with a dash `-` and cannot be claimed by either player for the remainder of the game.

3. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends when **no available positions** remain for the next player to make a move.
   - The player who last claimed a position **wins** the game.
   - There are **no draws**; a win is always achieved.

4. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if it involves claiming an available position as per the rules above.
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn, they lose.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: Victory is determined by being the last player to make a valid move.
- **No Point System**: There is no point or scoring system; the outcome is a win or loss.
- **Tracking Progress**: Players can track progress through the visual representation of the board after each turn.

## Strategy Tips

- **Central Control**: Claiming central positions (like 7) can block more options for your opponent due to the immediate blocking of adjacent positions.
- **Anticipate Moves**: Try to predict which positions your opponent may aim for and block their strategic options.
- **Forced Moves**: Guide the game in a way that forces your opponent into areas with fewer available positions.
- **Endgame Planning**: Keep track of the remaining positions to ensure you are not left without a move on your turn.

---

## Conclusion

Blockade is a simple yet strategically deep game that requires foresight and planning. By understanding the mechanics of blocking and claiming positions, players can develop strategies to outmaneuver their opponent and secure victory.
