# Game Title: **Divisor Duel**

## Objective

Become the last player able to make a valid move by strategically selecting divisors of the current number. The player who reduces the number to 1 (where no further valid moves are possible) wins the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer, referred to as **N**. The default starting number is **100**, but players can agree on any positive integer to start.
- **Players**: Two players participate in the game, identified as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Game Components

- **Current Number (N)**: A shared positive integer that changes throughout the game based on player actions.
- **Divisors List**: A record of all valid divisors of the current number **N** at each turn.
- **Used Divisors List**: A list tracking all divisors that have been previously selected during the game.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Display Current Number**: At the beginning of a turn, the current value of **N** is displayed.
  2. **List Valid Divisors**: The game lists all positive integer divisors of **N** that have not been used yet.
  3. **Player Selects Divisor**: The player chooses one of the available divisors.
  4. **Update N**: The current number **N** is divided by the chosen divisor to get a new **N**.
  5. **Record Divisor**: The selected divisor is added to the **Used Divisors List**.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Divisors**:
   - A **valid divisor** is any positive integer greater than 1 that divides **N** evenly (no remainder) and has not been previously selected.
   - The divisor **1** is **not** considered a valid move and cannot be selected.

2. **Selecting a Divisor**:
   - On their turn, a player must select a valid divisor from the list.
   - If a player cannot select a valid divisor (i.e., there are none available), they lose the game.

3. **Updating N**:
   - After a valid divisor **d** is selected, update the current number: **N = N / d**.
   - The new **N** becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

4. **Used Divisors**:
   - Once a divisor has been selected, it cannot be used again for the remainder of the game.
   - The **Used Divisors List** is shared between players and updated each turn.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if they reduce **N** to **1** on their turn.
   - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winner is the player who successfully reduces **N** to **1** or forces the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.
- **No Points System**: The game does not track points; it is a win/loss outcome per match.
- **Match Play (Optional)**: Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Example Gameplay

### Sample Game

#### Starting the Game

- **Starting Number (N)**: 100
- **Used Divisors List**: Empty

#### Turn 1: Player 1

1. **Current N**: 100
2. **Valid Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
3. **Player 1 Selects**: 10
4. **Update N**: N = 100 / 10 = 10
5. **Used Divisors List**: [10]

#### Turn 2: Player 2

1. **Current N**: 10
2. **Valid Divisors**: 2, 5, 10
3. **Player 2 Selects**: 5
4. **Update N**: N = 10 / 5 = 2
5. **Used Divisors List**: [10, 5]

#### Turn 3: Player 1

1. **Current N**: 2
2. **Valid Divisors**: 2
3. **Player 1 Selects**: 2
4. **Update N**: N = 2 / 2 = 1
5. **Used Divisors List**: [10, 5, 2]
6. **Player 1 Wins**: N has been reduced to 1.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is how the game might look in a command-line interface.

#### Game Start

```
Welcome to Divisor Duel!
Starting Number (N): 100
Player 1 begins.

-----------------------------
Player 1's Turn
Current Number (N): 100
Available Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
Enter a divisor: 10

You chose divisor 10.
Updated Number (N): 10
-----------------------------
```

#### Next Turn

```
-----------------------------
Player 2's Turn
Current Number (N): 10
Available Divisors: 2, 5, 10
Enter a divisor: 5

You chose divisor 5.
Updated Number (N): 2
-----------------------------
```

#### Final Turn

```
-----------------------------
Player 1's Turn
Current Number (N): 2
Available Divisors: 2
Enter a divisor: 2

You chose divisor 2.
Updated Number (N): 1
-----------------------------

Player 1 has reduced N to 1 and wins the game!
Congratulations Player 1!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the consequences of your moves on future turns. Try to force your opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **Divisor Selection**: Choosing smaller divisors prolongs the game but may provide strategic advantages.
- **Used Divisors Awareness**: Keep track of the divisors that have been used to anticipate which options will be available on your next turn.

## Variations

- **Different Starting Numbers**: To increase complexity, start with larger numbers.
- **Restricted Divisors**: Limit the set of valid divisors to prime numbers or another subset.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Play best-of-three or more to determine the overall winner.
