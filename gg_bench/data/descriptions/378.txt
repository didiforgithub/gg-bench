# GridLock: A Two-Player Strategic Blockade Game

## Objective

**GridLock** is a strategic two-player game where the primary goal is to trap your opponent by blocking off their possible moves on a grid. Players take turns moving their markers and placing blocks to limit the opponent's options. The first player unable to make a valid move loses the game.

## Setup

- **Game Grid**: A 7x7 grid represented by coordinates `(row, column)` where `0 ≤ row, column ≤ 6`.
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1** starts with their marker at the left-center edge of the grid at position `(3, 0)`.
  - **Player 2** starts with their marker at the right-center edge of the grid at position `(3, 6)`.
- **Initial Conditions**: All other cells on the grid are empty and unblocked at the start of the game.

## Game Components

- **Grid Cells**:
  - **Empty Cells**: Cells that are neither occupied by a marker nor blocked. Players can move their markers onto these cells.
  - **Blocked Cells**: Cells that have been blocked by players during the game. Neither player can move onto these cells.
- **Player Markers**:
  - Each player has a unique marker (`P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2) that occupies a single cell on the grid.
- **Blocks**:
  - Represented in the game interface as `X`. Blocks occupy a single cell and prevent movement onto that cell.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Move**: The player moves their marker to an adjacent empty cell.
     - Movement can be in any of the four cardinal directions: up, down, left, or right.
     - Diagonal movement is not allowed.
     - The destination cell must be within the bounds of the grid and unblocked.
  2. **Block Placement**: After moving, the player must place a block on any empty and unblocked cell that is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to their marker's new position.
     - If no such cells are available for block placement, the player skips this step.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Movement Rules**:
  - A player cannot move onto a blocked cell or a cell occupied by the opponent's marker.
  - A player cannot move off the grid.
- **Block Placement Rules**:
  - Blocks remain on the grid for the remainder of the game once placed.
  - A block can only be placed on an empty, unblocked cell adjacent to the player's current marker position.
  - Blocking the opponent's immediate path is a key strategy.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - If a player has no valid moves on their turn (i.e., all adjacent cells are either blocked or off the grid), they lose the game.
  - The opponent is declared the winner.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: The game is won by the player who successfully traps their opponent, leaving them with no legal moves on their turn.

## Examples

### Sample Turn Sequence

Assuming the grid coordinates are formatted as `(row, column)`:

1. **Initial Positions**:
   - Player 1 marker at `(3, 0)`
   - Player 2 marker at `(3, 6)`

2. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Move**: Player 1 moves from `(3, 0)` to `(3, 1)`.
   - **Block Placement**: Player 1 places a block at `(2, 1)`.

3. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Move**: Player 2 moves from `(3, 6)` to `(3, 5)`.
   - **Block Placement**: Player 2 places a block at `(4, 5)`.

4. **Player 1's Next Turn**:
   - **Move**: Player 1 moves from `(3, 1)` to `(2, 1)` (since `(2, 1)` is now blocked, this move is invalid).
   - **Valid Move**: Player 1 moves to `(3, 2)` instead.
   - **Block Placement**: Player 1 places a block at `(3, 1)`.

### Command-Line Interaction

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  ```
  Player 1, enter your move (up/down/left/right):
  > right
  You moved to (3, 1).
  Enter block position to place a block adjacent to your current position:
  > (2, 1)
  Block placed at (2, 1).
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  ```
  Player 2, enter your move (up/down/left/right):
  > left
  You moved to (3, 5).
  Enter block position to place a block adjacent to your current position:
  > (4, 5)
  Block placed at (4, 5).
  ```

## Additional Notes

- **Strategic Depth**:
  - Players must balance between advancing their position and limiting the opponent's options.
  - Anticipating the opponent's possible moves enhances the chance of victory.
- **Game End**:
  - The game typically ends quickly as the grid fills with blocks.
  - Skilled players can leverage block placement to control the flow of the game.

## Conclusion

**GridLock** is a simple yet strategic game that tests players' foresight and planning. Its straightforward rules make it easy to code for a command-line interface, and the lack of a draw condition ensures each game concludes with a definitive winner. Enjoy outmaneuvering your opponent in this battle of wits!
