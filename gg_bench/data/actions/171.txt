The action space in the gym environment is represented by a discrete space with 29 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 28. Each action index corresponds to selecting a factor of the current N during the game. The mapping of actions to factors is done by adding 2 to the action index, so action 0 corresponds to the factor 2, action 1 corresponds to the factor 3, up to action 28 corresponding to the factor 30. This mapping aligns the selected action with a factor the player can choose to divide the current N by, provided it is a valid factor according to the game's rules.
