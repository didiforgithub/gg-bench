The action space of the Color Clash gym environment consists of 36 discrete actions, each representing a specific move a player can make by selecting a disk and moving it to a target position on the track. Each action index corresponds to a tuple (disk, target_position) where the indices 0-17 represent the moves for the Red player's disks (R1, R2, R3, R4) and indices 18-35 represent the moves for the Blue player's disks (B1, B2, B3, B4). For each disk, possible target positions are all unoccupied positions that are numerically higher than the disk's current position and do not exceed position 9. The environment maintains a pre-defined mapping of these action indices to the respective (disk, target_position) combinations, which is used to interpret each action during gameplay.
