# Dominion Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Dominion Duel** is a two-player strategic game where players vie for control over a series of territories. The primary goal is to claim more territories than your opponent. The player who controls the majority of territories at the end of the game wins. With a total of nine territories, ties are impossible, ensuring a decisive victory for one player.

## Setup

1. **Game Board Initialization**: The game consists of a linear map of nine territories. These territories are represented by numbers from 1 to 9 arranged in sequential order:

   ```
   [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
   ```

2. **Starting Conditions**: At the beginning of the game, all territories are unclaimed and unlocked. There are no player tokens on the board yet.

3. **Player Assignments**:

   - **Player 1**: Uses the symbol `X` to mark claimed territories.
   - **Player 2**: Uses the symbol `O` to mark claimed territories.

4. **Initial Display**: The command-line interface will display the territories with their numbers:

   ```
   [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
   ```

## Game Components

1. **Territories**:

   - **Representation**: Each territory is represented by a numbered slot in the command-line interface.
   - **States**:

     - **Unclaimed**: Displayed with its territory number (e.g., `[5]`).
     - **Claimed**: Marked with the player's symbol (`[X]` or `[O]`).
     - **Locked**: Indicated with a lock symbol (e.g., `[ðŸ”’]`).

2. **Player Symbols**:

   - **Player 1**: `X`
   - **Player 2**: `O`

3. **Command-Line Interface**: The game operates entirely through text input and output, displaying the current state of the board after each turn.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:

   - The game begins with Player 1.
   - Players alternate turns thereafter.

2. **Turn Structure**:

   - **Claiming a Territory**:

     - On their turn, a player chooses an unclaimed and unlocked territory to claim by entering its number.
     - The chosen territory is marked with the player's symbol.

   - **Locking Adjacent Territories**:

     - After claiming a territory, any directly adjacent unclaimed territories become locked.
     - Locked territories cannot be claimed by either player for the remainder of the game.

3. **Turn Progression**:

   - After a player completes their turn, the game displays the updated board.
   - The next player then takes their turn following the same rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Claiming Territories**:

   - Players can only claim one territory per turn.
   - Only unclaimed and unlocked territories can be claimed.

2. **Locking Mechanism**:

   - When a territory is claimed, it causes immediate locking of adjacent unclaimed territories.
   - Adjacent territories are those directly next to the claimed territory (one number lower and one number higher).
   - Locked territories remain inaccessible for the rest of the game.

3. **End of the Game**:

   - The game ends when there are no unclaimed and unlocked territories remaining.
   - The player who has claimed the majority of territories wins.

4. **Invalid Moves**:

   - If a player attempts to claim a locked or already claimed territory, they are prompted to choose again.
   - The turn is only completed when a valid territory is claimed.

## Scoring

1. **Tracking Claims**:

   - Each player's claimed territories are tracked throughout the game.
   - The command-line interface displays claimed territories with the respective player's symbol.

2. **Determining the Winner**:

   - At game end, the number of territories claimed by each player is counted.
   - The player with the higher count of claimed territories is declared the winner.

3. **Tie Scenario**:

   - With a total of nine territories, it is impossible to have a tie.
   - The final score will always be 5-4, ensuring a decisive victory.
