**Blockade: Rule Book**

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player able to make a valid move. The game ends when a player cannot place a block on the board during their turn, resulting in a win for the other player. Strategic placement of blocks to limit your opponent's options while maximizing your own is key to victory.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Game Board**: A 6x6 grid representing the playing field.
2. **Initial State**: All cells on the grid are empty at the start of the game.
3. **Player Assignment**:
   - Player 1: Uses symbol 'X'.
   - Player 2: Uses symbol 'O'.

Players decide who will take the first turn (e.g., coin toss, mutual agreement).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Grid Cells**:
  - **Empty Cell**: Represented by a dot `.`.
  - **Player Block**: Represented by 'X' (Player 1) or 'O' (Player 2).
  - **Blocked Cell**: Represented by `#`, indicating the cell is unavailable for future moves.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player chosen during setup.
2. **Actions per Turn**:
   - **Place a Block**: Select an empty cell to place your block.
   - **Block Adjacent Cells**: After placing your block, all orthogonally adjacent empty cells (up, down, left, right) become blocked and are marked with `#`.
3. **Turn Progression**: Once a player completes their action, the turn passes to the opponent.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Placing Blocks**:
   - A block can only be placed on an empty cell (`.`).
   - You cannot place a block on a cell that is already occupied (`X` or `O`) or blocked (`#`).
2. **Blocking Cells**:
   - Only orthogonally adjacent empty cells are blocked (diagonals are not affected).
   - Blocked cells (`#`) are unavailable for the remainder of the game.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn (no empty cells to place a block), they lose the game.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.
4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts to make an invalid move, they must choose a different move.
   - If no valid moves are available, the player loses.

### **Scoring**

This game does not use a scoring system. Victory is determined solely by being the last player able to make a valid move.

### **Example Gameplay**

Below is a sample game illustrating the rules and command-line interactions.

**Initial Board State:**

```
. . . . . .

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Places 'X' at position (4, 2).
- **Blocks**: Cells at positions (3,2), (5,2), (4,1), (4,3).

**Note**: Cell (3,2) is already blocked; it remains blocked.

**Board State:**

```
O # . . . .
# . . . . .
. # X # . .
. . # . . .
. . # X # .
. . . # . .
```

**Gameplay Continues...**

Players continue to alternate turns, placing their blocks and blocking adjacent cells.

**Endgame Scenario:**

Suppose the board reaches a state where Player 2 has no valid moves.

**Final Board State:**

```
O # O # X #
# # # # # #
# # X # # #
# # # # # #
# # # X # #
# # # # # #
```

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

Below is how the game might proceed in a command-line interface.

**Turn 1: Player 1**

```
Player 1 (X), enter your move (row and column): 2 2
You placed an 'X' at (2,2).
Blocked cells at: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3).
```

**Turn 2: Player 2**

```
Player 2 (O), enter your move (row and column): 0 0
You placed an 'O' at (0,0).
Blocked cells at: (0,1), (1,0).
```

**...**

**Turn N: Player 2**

```
Player 2 (O), no valid moves remaining.
Player 1 (X) wins the game!
```

### **Strategies for Players**

- **Control the Center**: Placing blocks towards the center can limit your opponent's options more effectively.
- **Anticipate Moves**: Think ahead to block paths your opponent might use in future turns.
- **Avoid Corners Early**: Early moves in corners may limit your own options.
