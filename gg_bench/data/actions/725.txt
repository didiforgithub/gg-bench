In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for Divisor Duel, the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to `N_max`. Each index in the action space corresponds to a potential move, which is the divisor a player can subtract from the current number, `N`. However, only indices that represent proper divisors of `N` (greater than 1 and less than `N`) result in valid moves. Invalid indices (either corresponding to non-divisors of `N` or numbers outside the proper divisor range) result in an immediate game loss for the player attempting the move.
