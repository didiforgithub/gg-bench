In the game, the action space indices represent the selection of numbers from the available pool. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.M)`, meaning the indices range from 0 to M-1. Each index corresponds to selecting the number that is 1-based indexed from this pool, effectively mapping an index `action` to the number `action + 1` in the range from 1 to M.
