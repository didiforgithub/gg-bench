# Multiplier: A Two-Player Turn-Based Strategy Game

## Objective

**Multiplier** is a strategic two-player game where opponents take turns multiplying a shared cumulative number by integers between 2 and 9. The primary goal is to avoid being the player who causes the cumulative number to **reach or exceed a target value** (default is 1,000). Victory is achieved by forcing your opponent into a position where any legal move results in the cumulative number meeting or surpassing the target value, thus causing them to lose.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Cumulative Number**: The game begins with a shared cumulative number set to **1**.
2. **Target Value**: Players agree on a target value that the cumulative number should not reach or exceed. The default target value is **1,000**.
3. **Determine First Player**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., flip a coin, mutual agreement).
4. **Game Interface**: The game is played in a command-line interface where inputs and outputs are text-based.

## Game Components

- **Shared Cumulative Number**: A number visible to both players, starting at **1** and updated after each turn.
- **Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive. These are the allowable numbers players can use to multiply the cumulative number on their turn.
- **Target Value**: The agreed-upon number (default **1,000**) that players strive to avoid reaching or exceeding.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Text-based input/output for players to enter their moves and receive game updates.

## Turns

1. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player must:
   - Choose a multiplier between **2** and **9**.
   - Multiply the shared cumulative number by the chosen multiplier.
2. **Turn Progression**:
   - The game alternates between Player 1 and Player 2.
   - Each turn consists of:
     - Displaying the current cumulative number.
     - Prompting the current player for their multiplier choice.
     - Updating and displaying the new cumulative number.
3. **No Skipping**: Players cannot skip their turn or choose invalid multipliers.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Valid Multipliers**:
   - Only integers between **2** and **9** inclusive are allowed.
   - Multipliers can be reused any number of times by either player.
2. **Updating the Cumulative Number**:
   - Multiply the current cumulative number by the chosen multiplier.
   - The result becomes the new cumulative number.
3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If after a player's turn the cumulative number **equals or exceeds the target value**, that player **loses**.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - If your opponent causes the cumulative number to equal or exceed the target value on their turn, you **win**.
5. **Mandatory Moves**:
   - Players must make a move on their turn; passing is not permitted.

### Strategic Considerations

- Players should plan ahead to avoid reaching a position where any legal move results in a loss.
- Anticipate the results of potential multipliers to force your opponent into a losing position.
- The game requires foresight and calculation to manage the growth of the cumulative number.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game concludes with one player winning and the other losing based on the core rules.
- **No Point System**: There is no accumulation of points beyond determining the winner and the loser.
- **Match Play**: Players may agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

**Game Start**

- **Target Value**: 1,000
- **Starting Cumulative Number**: 1

**Turn Sequence**

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current Number: **1**
   - Player 1 chooses multiplier **5**.
   - Calculation: 1 × 5 = **5**
   - Updated Number: **5**

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Number: **5**
   - Player 2 chooses multiplier **7**.
   - Calculation: 5 × 7 = **35**
   - Updated Number: **35**

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current Number: **35**
   - Player 1 chooses multiplier **3**.
   - Calculation: 35 × 3 = **105**
   - Updated Number: **105**

4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Number: **105**
   - Player 2 chooses multiplier **9**.
   - Calculation: 105 × 9 = **945**
   - Updated Number: **945**

5. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current Number: **945**
   - Player 1 must choose a multiplier between 2 and 9.
   - Any choice will cause the cumulative number to reach or exceed 1,000.
   - Player 1 chooses multiplier **2**.
   - Calculation: 945 × 2 = **1,890**
   - Updated Number: **1,890**
   - **Player 1 loses**, as the cumulative number exceeds 1,000.
   - **Player 2 wins** the game.

### Command-Line Interaction

```
=== Multiplier Game Start ===
Target Value: 1000
Starting Cumulative Number: 1

--- Player 1's Turn ---
Current Cumulative Number: 1
Choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 5
You chose: 5
Updated Cumulative Number: 5

--- Player 2's Turn ---
Current Cumulative Number: 5
Choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 7
You chose: 7
Updated Cumulative Number: 35

--- Player 1's Turn ---
Current Cumulative Number: 35
Choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 3
You chose: 3
Updated Cumulative Number: 105

--- Player 2's Turn ---
Current Cumulative Number: 105
Choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 9
You chose: 9
Updated Cumulative Number: 945

--- Player 1's Turn ---
Current Cumulative Number: 945
Choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 2
You chose: 2
Updated Cumulative Number: 1890

The cumulative number has reached or exceeded the target value of 1000.
Player 1 loses!
Player 2 wins the game!

## Strategic Depth

**Multiplier** offers significant strategic depth despite its simple rules:

- **Mathematical Planning**: Players must perform calculations to predict future cumulative numbers based on possible multipliers.
- **Forced Moves**: Skilled players can force their opponents into positions where all options result in a loss.
- **Decision Making**: Choosing when to use higher or lower multipliers can change the game's outcome.
- **Adaptability**: Players must adapt their strategies based on their opponent's moves.

---

## Game Variations

To add variety and complexity, players can agree on different target values or restrict available multipliers. Examples include:

- **Lower Target Value**: Setting the target value to 500 for a quicker game.
- **Restricted Multipliers**: Limiting multipliers to a smaller range, such as 2 to 5.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Playing best-of-three or best-of-five matches to determine the overall winner.
