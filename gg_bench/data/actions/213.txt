In the game environment, the action space is defined as `Discrete(18)`, representing possible actions based on selecting a number and an operation. Each number from 1 to 9 can either be added or subtracted from the current player's score, resulting in 18 unique actions. The mapping is as follows:

- Actions 0 and 1 correspond to number 1, with 0 meaning add, and 1 meaning subtract.
- Actions 2 and 3 correspond to number 2, with 2 meaning add, and 3 meaning subtract.
- Actions 4 and 5 correspond to number 3, with 4 meaning add, and 5 meaning subtract.
- Actions 6 and 7 correspond to number 4, with 6 meaning add, and 7 meaning subtract.
- Actions 8 and 9 correspond to number 5, with 8 meaning add, and 9 meaning subtract.
- Actions 10 and 11 correspond to number 6, with 10 meaning add, and 11 meaning subtract.
- Actions 12 and 13 correspond to number 7, with 12 meaning add, and 13 meaning subtract.
- Actions 14 and 15 correspond to number 8, with 14 meaning add, and 15 meaning subtract.
- Actions 16 and 17 correspond to number 9, with 16 meaning add, and 17 meaning subtract.
