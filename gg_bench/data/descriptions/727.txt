# Number Capture

## Objective

Be the **first player to capture the last remaining number** from a shared list by following the capture rules, thereby winning the game.

## Setup

- **Shared Number List**: Create a shared list of numbers from **1 to 9**.
- **Players**: Two players are required. Decide randomly who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Initial Captures**: Both players start with an empty list of captured numbers.

## Game Components

### Shared Number List

- **Description**: A list containing the integers from **1** to **9** inclusive.
- **Appearance**: Displayed in numerical order, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
- **Functionality**: Represents the pool of numbers available for capture by the players.

### Captured Numbers

- **Description**: Each player has their own collection of numbers they have captured during the game.
- **Functionality**: Keeps track of the numbers each player has captured.
- **Initial State**: Empty at the start of the game for both players.

## Turns

### Turn Order

- Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.

### Turn Structure

1. **Selection Phase**:
   - The player selects a number from the **Shared Number List** following the **Capture Rule**.
2. **Capture Phase**:
   - The selected number is **removed** from the Shared Number List.
   - The number is added to the player's list of **Captured Numbers**.
3. **End of Turn**:
   - The turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Capture Rule

- **First Turn Exception**:
  - On the very first turn of the game, Player 1 may capture **any number** from the Shared Number List.
- **Subsequent Turns**:
  - A player **cannot** capture a number that is **numerically adjacent** to the **last number captured** by **either player**.
- **Numerically Adjacent Numbers**:
  - Numbers that differ by exactly 1.
  - For number `N`, the adjacent numbers are `N - 1` and `N + 1`.
- **Example**:
  - If the last captured number is **5**, the numbers **4** and **6** are considered adjacent and cannot be captured on the next turn.

### Valid Moves

- A move is valid if:
  - The selected number is in the Shared Number List.
  - The selected number is **not numerically adjacent** to the last captured number by either player.

### Winning the Game

- The game continues with players **alternating turns** and capturing numbers according to the Capture Rule.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - The player who captures the **last remaining number** from the Shared Number List **wins the game**.

### Skipping Turns

- If a player has **no valid numbers** to capture on their turn (all remaining numbers are adjacent to the last captured number), they **skip their turn**.
- The game continues with the other player.

- **Note**: Due to the finite set of numbers and capture rules, the game cannot result in an infinite loop and will always conclude with a winner.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Game Start

- **Shared Number List**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- **Player 1's Captured Numbers**: `[]`
- **Player 2's Captured Numbers**: `[]`

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Capture**: Player 1 captures **5** (any number is allowed on the first turn).
- **Shared Number List**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- **Player 1's Captured Numbers**: `[5]`
- **Last Captured Number**: `5`

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Unavailable Numbers**: Cannot capture numbers adjacent to `5`, so **4** and **6** are not allowed.
- **Available Numbers**: `[1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]`
- **Capture**: Player 2 captures **9**.
- **Shared Number List**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]`
- **Player 2's Captured Numbers**: `[9]`
- **Last Captured Number**: `9`

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Unavailable Numbers**: Cannot capture numbers adjacent to `9`, so **8** is not allowed.
- **Available Numbers**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]`
- **Capture**: Player 1 captures **6**.
- **Shared Number List**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]`
- **Player 1's Captured Numbers**: `[5, 6]`
- **Last Captured Number**: `6`

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Unavailable Numbers**: Cannot capture numbers adjacent to `6`, so **7** is not allowed.
- **Available Numbers**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 8]`
- **Capture**: Player 2 captures **2**.
- **Shared Number List**: `[1, 3, 4, 7, 8]`
- **Player 2's Captured Numbers**: `[9, 2]`
- **Last Captured Number**: `2`

#### Continuing the Game

- Players continue to alternate turns, following the capture rules, until all numbers have been captured.
- The player who captures the **last number** wins the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Shared List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Player 1's Captures: []
Player 2's Captures: []

Player 1, select a number to capture: 5

Shared List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Player 1's Captures: [5]
Player 2's Captures: []

Player 2, select a number to capture.
Unavailable numbers (adjacent to 5): [4, 6]
Available numbers: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]
Your selection: 9

Shared List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
Player 1's Captures: [5]
Player 2's Captures: [9]

Player 1, select a number to capture.
Unavailable numbers (adjacent to 9): [8]
Available numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]
Your selection: 6

Shared List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]
Player 1's Captures: [5, 6]
Player 2's Captures: [9]

...

Game Over.
Player 1 captured the last number and wins the game!
```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Anticipate which numbers will be unavailable on your next turn based on the current captures.
- **Blocking Moves**: Capture numbers that limit your opponent's options, potentially forcing them to skip a turn.
- **Endgame Strategy**: Pay attention to the remaining numbers and plan to be the one to capture the last number.

## Ensuring a Skilled Player's Advantage

- The game requires players to think ahead and strategize to control the flow of available numbers.
- A skilled player can consistently anticipate the effects of their captures on future turns, giving them an advantage over less experienced players.
