# Divisor Duel

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where players take turns selecting numbers from a shared grid. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move according to the game's rules. A player wins by selecting a number that leaves no valid options for the opponent on their next turn, thus causing the opponent to lose.

## Setup

1. **Game Grid Initialization**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid containing the numbers 1 through 9 arranged as follows:

   ```
   1 2 3
   4 5 6
   7 8 9
   ```

2. **Starting Conditions**:
   - All numbers on the grid are initially unclaimed and available for selection.
   - Players decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Game Grid**:
  - A 3x3 grid displaying numbers 1 to 9.
  - Each number represents a selectable position on the grid.
  - Numbers are unmarked at the start and become marked when selected.

- **Markers**:
  - Virtual markers are used to indicate numbers that have been selected.
  - In a command-line interface, this could be shown by listing selected numbers or marking them as unavailable.

- **Players**:
  - Two players: Player 1 and Player 2.
  - No physical tokens are required; players keep track of selections through the interface.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns, with the starting player making the first move.
  
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Selection Phase**:
     - The current player selects an unclaimed number from the grid that adheres to the selection rules (see Rules and Mechanics).
  2. **Validation Phase**:
     - The game checks if the selected number is valid.
     - If the move is invalid, the player is prompted to choose again.
  3. **Update Phase**:
     - The selected number is marked as claimed and is no longer available.
  4. **End Turn**:
     - The turn ends, and control passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **First Move**:
   - On the first turn of the game, the starting player may select any unclaimed number from the grid.

2. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - On their turn, a player must select an unclaimed number that is either a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the **number selected by the opponent on their previous turn**.
   - Only numbers that satisfy this condition and are unclaimed can be selected.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - A valid move is one where the selected number fulfills the divisor or multiple condition relative to the opponent's last selected number.
   - If no valid moves are available, the player loses the game.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - A player wins if they successfully select a number that leaves the opponent with no valid moves on their subsequent turn.
- **Losing the Game**:
  - A player loses if, on their turn, they have no valid numbers to select according to the game rules.

## Scoring

- **Game Outcome**:
  - The game is won by the player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves.
  - There is no point scoring system; the outcome is a win or loss based on gameplay.
