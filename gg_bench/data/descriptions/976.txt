# Maze Runner Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
Be the first player to navigate through a shared grid maze and reach the center position. Utilize strategic movement and anticipate your opponent's secret obstacles to achieve victory.

**Victory Condition:**  
- The first player to reach the center position **(3,3)** wins the game.
- A player loses if they are unable to make a valid move on their turn and their opponent reaches the center before them.

## Setup

1. **Game Board Initialization:**
   - The game is played on a **5x5 grid** with positions labeled from **(1,1)** to **(5,5)**.
   - The grid represents the maze through which players will navigate.

2. **Player Starting Positions:**
   - **Player 1** starts at the **top-left corner** of the grid at position **(1,1)**.
   - **Player 2** starts at the **bottom-right corner** of the grid at position **(5,5)**.

3. **Obstacle Placement:**
   - Before the game begins, each player secretly places **three obstacles** on the grid.
   - Obstacles cannot be placed on:
     - The starting positions **(1,1)** and **(5,5)**.
     - The center position **(3,3)**.
   - Obstacles block movement through their positions.
   - Players should record their obstacle positions privately without revealing them to the opponent.

## Game Components

- **5x5 Grid Maze:**
  - Represents the game board where players move.
  - Positions are denoted by coordinates **(row, column)**.

- **Player Tokens:**
  - Each player has a token that represents their current position on the grid.
  - Tokens cannot occupy the same position.

- **Obstacles:**
  - Each player has three obstacles.
  - Obstacles are hidden from the opponent until encountered.
  - Obstacles block movement through the grid positions where they are placed.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Move Action:**
     - A player moves their token to an adjacent grid position.
     - Allowed movements are **up, down, left, or right** (no diagonal moves).
     - The player specifies the direction of movement.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - After moving, if the player lands on an obstacle (known only after attempting the move), they must follow the obstacle rules.
   - The turn then passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Valid Moves:**
  - A move must stay within the bounds of the grid (positions **(1,1)** to **(5,5)**).
  - A player cannot move onto the position occupied by the opponent's token.
  - Players can only move to adjacent positions (no jumping over positions).

- **Encountering Obstacles:**
  - If a player attempts to move into a position that contains an obstacle:
    - The obstacle is revealed to the moving player.
    - The player **remains in their current position**; the move is unsuccessful.
    - The player **loses their next turn** as they recover from the failed move.
  - The obstacle remains on the grid and will continue to affect future movements.

### Obstacle Mechanics

- **Secret Placement:**
  - Obstacles are placed secretly at the start and are only revealed when a player attempts to move onto them.

- **Obstacle Restrictions:**
  - Obstacles cannot be placed on:
    - Starting positions **(1,1)** or **(5,5)**.
    - The center position **(3,3)**.

### Winning the Game

- **Reaching the Center:**
  - The first player to successfully move their token to the center position **(3,3)** wins.

- **Opponent's Inability to Move:**
  - If a player is unable to make any valid moves due to obstacles and the opponent reaches the center position before them, they lose the game.

### Special Conditions

- **Blocked Paths:**
  - If both players become blocked by obstacles and neither can reach the center, the player closest to the center at the time becomes the winner.
  - Distance is calculated based on the number of moves required to reach the center position from the current position, avoiding known obstacles.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

#### Initial Setup

- **Player 1 Starting Position:** (1,1)
- **Player 2 Starting Position:** (5,5)
- **Player 1's Obstacles:** (2,3), (3,2), (4,3) *(secretly placed)*
- **Player 2's Obstacles:** (2,2), (3,4), (4,2) *(secretly placed)*

#### Turn Sequence

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Moves from **(1,1)** to **(1,2)** (right).
   - Move is successful.

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Moves from **(5,5)** to **(5,4)** (left).
   - Move is successful.

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Moves from **(1,2)** to **(2,2)** (down).
   - **Encountered Obstacle!**
     - Position **(2,2)** contains an obstacle placed by Player 2.
     - Player 1 remains at **(1,2)** and loses their next turn.

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Moves from **(5,4)** to **(4,4)** (up).
   - Move is successful.

5. **Player 2's Turn (since Player 1 lost a turn):**
   - Moves from **(4,4)** to **(3,4)** (up).
   - **Encountered Obstacle!**
     - Position **(3,4)** contains an obstacle placed by Player 2.
     - Player 2 remains at **(4,4)** and loses their next turn.

6. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - (Player 1's turn resumes after losing a turn)
   - Chooses to move from **(1,2)** to **(1,3)** (right).
   - Move is successful.

7. **Player 1's Turn (since Player 2 lost a turn):**
   - Moves from **(1,3)** to **(2,3)** (down).
   - **Encountered Obstacle!**
     - Position **(2,3)** contains an obstacle placed by Player 1 (self-placed obstacles do not affect the player).
     - Since players are not affected by their own obstacles, Player 1 moves successfully.

8. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - (Player 2's turn resumes after losing a turn)
   - Moves from **(4,4)** to **(3,4)** (up).
   - **Encountered Obstacle!**
     - Position **(3,4)** already known to be an obstacle.
     - Player 2 remains at **(4,4)** and loses their next turn.

9. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Moves from **(2,3)** to **(3,3)** (down).
   - **Reaches Center Position!**
   - **Player 1 Wins the Game!**

## Strategic Tips

- **Obstacle Placement:**
  - Place obstacles to block likely paths your opponent might take.
  - Consider the symmetry of the board and opponent's starting position.

- **Movement Planning:**
  - Anticipate possible obstacles based on your own placements.
  - Choose paths with multiple route options to avoid being trapped by obstacles.

- **Observation:**
  - Keep track of where your opponent hesitates or loses turns, as it may reveal obstacle positions.

- **Risk Management:**
  - Sometimes taking a longer path with fewer risks can be better than a direct path that may be obstructed.

## Conclusion

"Maze Runner Duel" is a game of strategic movement and anticipation. By carefully planning your moves and predicting your opponent's obstacles, you can navigate the maze efficiently and reach the center before your opponent. Enjoy the challenge and may the best pathfinder win!
