# Sequence Duel

## Objective

Sequence Duel is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where players compete to be the first to create a numerical sequence following specific arithmetic rules. The primary goal is to be the first player to obtain three numbers that satisfy the condition: one number is the sum or difference of the other two. Players must strategically select numbers to build their sequence while blocking their opponent's attempts to do the same.

Victory is achieved by being the first to form a valid sequence of three numbers **a**, **b**, and **c**, in any order, such that:

- **a + b = c**, or
- **a - b = c** (including negative results).

## Setup

1. **Number Pool**: The game uses a shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9**.
2. **Player Hands**: Each player starts with an empty hand.
3. **First Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number List**: A list of numbers from **1** to **9** available for selection. Each number can be selected only once.
  
  ```
  Available Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  ```

- **Player Hands**: Records of numbers each player has selected.
  - **Player 1 Hand**: Numbers selected by Player 1.
  - **Player 2 Hand**: Numbers selected by Player 2.

- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via text input and output.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with the first player.
- **On a Player's Turn**:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose one number from the available numbers in the shared number list.
  2. **Update Hands**:
     - Add the selected number to the player's hand.
     - Remove the selected number from the shared number list.
  3. **Check for Victory**:
     - After each turn, check if the player has a sequence satisfying the victory condition.
     - If victory is achieved, the game ends.
  4. **Pass Turn**: The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On each turn, a player must select **one** available number from the shared number list.
   - Numbers are selected by specifying the desired number.

2. **Sequence Formation**:
   - Players aim to collect three numbers that can form an equation of the form:
     - **a + b = c** or **a - b = c**, where **a**, **b**, and **c** are any three numbers from the player's hand.
   - The numbers can be used in any order.
   - Equations must use **exactly three numbers** from the player's hand.
   - All numbers in the equation must be from the player's hand; numbers from the opponent's hand or unselected numbers cannot be used.

3. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Win**: A player wins immediately upon forming a valid sequence satisfying the victory condition.
   - **Loss**: A player loses if the opponent forms a valid sequence first.
   - **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw since a finite number of numbers ensures that eventually, one player will achieve the victory condition.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts to select a number that is not available, they must choose another number.
   - Failure to select a valid number on a turn (e.g., due to inputting an invalid choice) results in losing that turn but does not incur additional penalties.

5. **Strategy**:
   - Players must balance between advancing their sequences and blocking the opponent.
   - Observing the opponent's selections is crucial for anticipating and preventing their victory.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who first forms a valid sequence according to the victory condition is declared the winner.
- **Tracking Scores**:
  - Although individual games result in a win or loss, players may keep a tally of wins over multiple games to determine overall performance.
  - **Optional**: Assign points for wins to create a match (e.g., first to 3 wins).
