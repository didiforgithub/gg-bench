The action space in the gym environment is a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to 5, each uniquely corresponding to one of the six allowable prime numbers for subtraction in the game. The mapping between action space indices and the prime numbers is as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the prime number 2.
- Index 1 corresponds to the prime number 3.
- Index 2 corresponds to the prime number 5.
- Index 3 corresponds to the prime number 7.
- Index 4 corresponds to the prime number 11.
- Index 5 corresponds to the prime number 13.

Players select an action by choosing an index, which then maps to the respective prime number to be subtracted from the current total.
