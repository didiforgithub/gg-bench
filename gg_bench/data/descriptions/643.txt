# Trap Runner

## Rule Book

### Objective

The goal of **Trap Runner** is to be the first player to reach the goal square (square 10) by advancing along a linear track while avoiding traps set by your opponent. Victory is achieved when a player lands exactly on square 10 during their turn.

### Setup

- **Track**: A linear sequence of squares numbered from 0 (start) to 10 (goal).
- **Starting Positions**: Both players begin at square 0.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token representing their current position on the track.
- **Traps**: Invisible markers that players can place on squares to hinder their opponent.

### Game Components

- **Track**
  - A straight line of squares numbered from 0 to 10.
  - Square 0 is the starting point for both players.
  - Square 10 is the goal; landing here wins the game.

- **Player Tokens**
  - Represent each player's current position.
  - Move forward along the track based on player choices.

- **Traps**
  - Invisible to the opponent.
  - Set on squares the player leaves during movement.
  - Triggered when the opponent lands on a trapped square.

### Turns

- Players alternate turns.
- Each turn consists of two phases:
  1. **Movement Phase**
     - Choose to move forward 1, 2, or 3 squares.
  2. **Trap Setting Phase**
     - Optionally set a trap on the square just left (except square 0).

### Rules and Mechanics

#### Movement Rules

1. **Advance Forward**
   - On your turn, move your token forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** squares.
   - Example: If you're on square 4, you can move to square 5, 6, or 7.

2. **No Backward Movement**
   - You cannot move backward or stay on the same square.

3. **Exact Landing**
   - You must land exactly on square 10 to win.
   - If moving the full amount would take you past square 10, you must adjust your move to land on square 10.
   - Example: If you're on square 8, you can only move **2** to land on square 10.

#### Trap Setting Rules

1. **Setting a Trap**
   - After moving, you may set a trap on the square you just left.
   - Traps cannot be set on square 0.

2. **One Trap per Square**
   - Each square can hold only one trap.
   - If a square already has a trap (even your own), you cannot place another.

3. **Invisible Traps**
   - Traps are invisible to your opponent but known to you.

#### Encountering Traps

1. **Triggering a Trap**
   - If you land on a square with an opponent's trap, you are **sent back to square 0**.
   - This takes effect immediately at the **start of your next turn**.

2. **Own Traps**
   - Landing on your own trap has no effect.

3. **Trap Persistence**
   - Traps remain on the squares where they were set for the rest of the game.

#### Winning the Game

- **Reach Square 10 First**
  - The first player to land exactly on square 10 wins.
  - There are no draws or ties.

### Scoring

- No points are tracked.
- Victory is achieved by reaching square 10 before your opponent.
