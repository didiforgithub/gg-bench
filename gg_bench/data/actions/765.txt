In the game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with two possible actions, represented by the indices 0 and 1. These indices map to the player's move options as follows: 

- Action index 0 corresponds to moving the token 1 step closer to the opponent's base.
- Action index 1 corresponds to moving the token 2 steps closer to the opponent's base.
