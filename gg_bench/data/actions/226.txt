The action space indices in the game range from 0 to 9, each corresponding to adding an integer from 1 to 10 to the shared number. Specifically, the action index 0 maps to adding 1, index 1 maps to adding 2, and so on, up to index 9, which maps to adding 10. This mapping ensures each possible move (adding an integer from 1 to 10) is represented as a discrete action index for the environment.
