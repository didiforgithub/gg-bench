In the provided gym environment for Factor Duel, the action space indices directly map to potential moves by representing the possible divisors a player can select during their turn. Each index in the action space (ranging from 0 to 60) corresponds to an integer that a player might consider as a factor to divide the shared number. However, only indices corresponding to actual proper factors of the current shared number (excluding 0, 1, and the number itself) are valid moves. The environment checks the validity of an action by ensuring that it aligns with these proper factors, allowing the player to legally reduce the shared number and continue the game.
