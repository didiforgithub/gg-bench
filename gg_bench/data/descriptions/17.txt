**Divisor Duel**

---

**Objective:**

Divisor Duel is a two-player turn-based strategy game. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to **1** on your turn. Players take turns dividing the shared number by its proper divisors (excluding **1** and the number itself). Strategic selection of divisors and anticipation of your opponent's moves are key to victory.

**Setup:**

1. **Shared Number Initialization:**
   - The game starts with a positive integer known as the **Shared Number**. Players agree on this starting number before the game begins.
   - Recommended starting numbers are composite numbers greater than **1** (e.g., **30**, **48**, **60**) to allow for a more engaging game.

2. **Player Positions:**
   - Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

**Game Components:**

1. **Shared Number:**
   - A single positive integer that both players manipulate during the game.
   - It changes as players apply divisions on their turns.

2. **Proper Divisors:**
   - These are divisors of the Shared Number excluding **1** and the number itself.
   - Only proper divisors are used for division during the game.

**Turns:**

- **Turn Structure:**
  - Players alternate turns starting with the first player.
  - On a player's turn, they must perform the following action:
    1. **Select a Proper Divisor:** Choose a proper divisor of the current Shared Number.
    2. **Divide the Shared Number:** Divide the Shared Number by the chosen proper divisor.
    3. **Update the Shared Number:** The result of the division becomes the new Shared Number.

- **Order of Actions:**
  1. **Determine Proper Divisors:** List all proper divisors of the current Shared Number.
  2. **Choose Divisor:** Select one proper divisor to divide the Shared Number.
  3. **Apply Division:** Perform the division operation.
  4. **Announce New Shared Number:** Inform the opponent of the new Shared Number.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Division Rules:**
   - **Proper Divisors Only:** Players can only divide the Shared Number by its proper divisors, which exclude **1** and the number itself.
   - **Integer Division:** The division must result in an integer; no fractions or decimals are allowed.
   - **Valid Moves:** If a player cannot perform a valid division because there are no proper divisors (i.e., when the Shared Number is **prime** or **1**), they lose the game.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player who successfully reduces the Shared Number to **1** on their turn **wins** the game.
   - If a player cannot make a move on their turn due to the Shared Number being **prime** or **1**, they **lose** the game.

3. **Proper Divisor Determination:**
   - A proper divisor of a number **N** is any positive integer other than **1** or **N** that divides **N** without leaving a remainder.
   - During their turn, players must accurately identify all proper divisors to determine their options.

4. **Strategy Considerations:**
   - Players should plan ahead to avoid leaving a prime number or **1** for their opponent, which could result in a loss.
   - Anticipating the sequence of possible Shared Numbers can provide a strategic advantage.

**Scoring:**

- **Victory:**
  - The game does not utilize a point-based scoring system.
  - The player who reduces the Shared Number to **1** on their turn is declared the **winner**.
  
- **Loss:**
  - If a player cannot make a valid move according to the rules, they **lose** the game.

**Examples:**

***Example Game Play:***

*Starting Shared Number: 30*

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current Shared Number:** 30
   - **Proper Divisors of 30:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
   - **Player 1 Chooses:** 5
   - **Calculation:** 30 รท 5 = 6
   - **New Shared Number:** 6
   - *Player 1 announces, "I divide 30 by 5 resulting in 6."*

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current Shared Number:** 6
   - **Proper Divisors of 6:** 2, 3
   - **Player 2 Chooses:** 2
   - **Calculation:** 6 รท 2 = 3
   - **New Shared Number:** 3
   - *Player 2 announces, "I divide 6 by 2 resulting in 3."*

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current Shared Number:** 3
   - **Proper Divisors of 3:** None (since 3 is prime)
   - **Player 1 cannot make a move and loses the game.**
   - *Player 1 says, "I cannot make a move. Congratulations, you win!"*

***Command-Line Interaction Sample:***

```
Game Start! Shared Number is 30.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper Divisors of 30: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter your chosen divisor: 5
You divided 30 by 5. New Shared Number is 6.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper Divisors of 6: 2, 3
Enter your chosen divisor: 2
You divided 6 by 2. New Shared Number is 3.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper Divisors of 3: None
No valid moves available. Player 2 wins!
```

**Additional Notes:**

- **Validation:** Players must ensure that their chosen divisor is indeed a proper divisor of the current Shared Number.
- **Disputes:** In case of disputes over proper divisors, players should verify divisibility together before proceeding.
- **Starting Number Selection:**
  - Choosing a larger composite number increases game length and complexity.
  - Players may agree on any starting number to adjust the game's difficulty.
