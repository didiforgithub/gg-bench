The action space indices (0 to 8) directly map to the numbers 1 to 9, respectively, which players can select as moves in the game. Each index corresponds to a specific number that can be chosen to add to the player's tower height. For example, index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9.
