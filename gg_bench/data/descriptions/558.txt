# Divisor Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move by selecting numbers from a shared pool. On each turn, a player must pick a number that is either a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the number selected by the previous player. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization**: The game begins with a shared pool of integers ranging from **2 to 50** inclusive.
2. **Determine First Player**: Decide randomly or by mutual agreement which player will take the first turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list of integers from **2 to 50** that are available for selection.
- **Selected Numbers**: Numbers that have been chosen by the players are removed from the pool and cannot be selected again.
- **Current Number**: The number selected by the most recent player, which dictates the valid choices for the next player.

---

## Turns

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Select **any number** from the number pool.
   - Remove the selected number from the pool.
2. **Player 2's Turn and Subsequent Turns**:
   - Choose a number from the pool that is either a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the **current number** (the number chosen by the previous player).
   - Remove the selected number from the pool.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Players alternate turns following the above rules.
   - The **current number** is updated after each valid selection.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the selected number is **unselected** (still in the pool) and is a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the current number.
   - **Divisors**: Numbers that divide the current number without leaving a remainder.
   - **Multiples**: Numbers that the current number divides into without leaving a remainder.
2. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Selecting a number that is not a divisor or multiple of the current number.
   - Choosing a number that has already been selected.
3. **Unable to Move**:
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn, they **lose** the game.
4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Scoring

- The game uses a **win/loss** scoring system.
  - **Winner**: The last player able to make a valid move.
  - **Loser**: The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Number Pool**: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 50]

#### Turn 1:
- **Player 1** selects **12**.
- **Current Number** is now **12**.
- **Number Pool** is now missing **12**.

#### Turn 2:
- **Player 2** must choose a divisor or multiple of **12**.
- **Possible Choices**: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 (already selected), 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 48.
- **Player 2** selects **6**.
- **Current Number** is now **6**.
- **Number Pool** is now missing **6**.

#### Turn 3:
- **Player 1** must choose a divisor or multiple of **6**.
- **Possible Choices**: 2, 3, 4, 6 (already selected), 12 (already selected), 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48.
- **Player 1** selects **18**.
- **Current Number** is now **18**.
- **Number Pool** is now missing **18**.

#### Turn 4:
- **Player 2** must choose a divisor or multiple of **18**.
- **Possible Choices**: 2, 3, 4, 6 (already selected), 9, 12 (already selected), 18 (already selected), 36, 45, 54.
- **Player 2** selects **9**.
- **Current Number** is now **9**.
- **Number Pool** is now missing **9**.

#### Turn 5:
- **Player 1** must choose a divisor or multiple of **9**.
- **Possible Choices**: 3, 6 (already selected), 9 (already selected), 12 (already selected), 18 (already selected), 27, 36, 45.
- **Player 1** selects **3**.
- **Current Number** is now **3**.
- **Number Pool** is now missing **3**.

#### Turn 6:
- **Player 2** must choose a divisor or multiple of **3**.
- **Possible Choices**: 6 (already selected), 9 (already selected), 12 (already selected), 15, 18 (already selected), 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
- **Player 2** selects **15**.
- **Current Number** is now **15**.
- **Number Pool** is now missing **15**.

#### Turns Continue...

- The game continues in this manner until a player cannot make a valid move.
- **Strategy Tip**: Try to force your opponent into numbers with fewer divisors and multiples left in the pool.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming the game is implemented in a command-line interface, here is how a sample turn might look:

```
[Turn 1] Player 1, select a number from the pool:

Available Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 50
Player 1 selects: 12

[Turn 2] Player 2, select a divisor or multiple of 12:

Available Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 50 (excluding 12)
Player 2 selects: 6

[Turn 3] Player 1, select a divisor or multiple of 6:

Available Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, ..., 50 (excluding 6, 12)
Player 1 selects: 18

...

[Final Turn] Player 2, no valid moves available. You lose!
```

## Notes on Strategy

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the remaining numbers in the pool and anticipate your opponent's possible moves.
- **Control the Game**: Try to select numbers that limit your opponent's options on their next turn.
- **Number Properties**: Familiarity with divisibility and multiples can provide a strategic advantage.
