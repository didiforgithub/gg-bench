# Grid Conquest

## Objective

Be the player who controls the majority of cells on the grid at the end of the game. Victory is achieved by strategically claiming and challenging cells to control more regions than your opponent.

## Setup

- **Players**: 2
- **Grid**: A 3x3 grid with cells numbered from 1 to 9 for easy reference.
- **Markers**:
  - Player 1: `'X'`
  - Player 2: `'O'`
- **Challenge Numbers**: Each player has a set of numbers from 1 to 5, available for use during challenges.

## Game Components

### 3x3 Grid

```
1 | 2 | 3
--+---+--
4 | 5 | 6
--+---+--
7 | 8 | 9
```

### Player Markers

- **Player 1**: `'X'`
- **Player 2**: `'O'`

### Challenge Numbers

- **Available Numbers**: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` (per player)
- **Usage**: Numbers are used during challenges and cannot be reused once spent.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.
- On your turn, you **must** perform one of the following actions:
  1. **Claim an Empty Cell**
  2. **Challenge an Opponent's Cell**

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Claiming an Empty Cell

- **Action**: Place your marker (`'X'` or `'O'`) in any unclaimed cell.
- **Restriction**: The cell must be unoccupied.

### 2. Challenging an Opponent's Cell

- **Action**: Attempt to take over a cell occupied by your opponent.
- **Procedure**:
  - **Step 1**: Declare the cell number you wish to challenge.
  - **Step 2**: Both players secretly select a challenge number from their available numbers.
  - **Step 3**: Reveal the selected numbers simultaneously.
  - **Outcome**:
    - The player with the **higher** number wins the challenge and gains control of the cell.
    - In case of a **tie**, the **defender** (current owner) retains control.
  - **Spent Numbers**: Both numbers used in the challenge are **discarded** and cannot be used again.

### Challenge Number Restrictions

- You cannot use a number that has already been spent.
- If you have no remaining numbers, you cannot initiate a challenge but can still be challenged.

### 3. Game End

- The game ends when **all cells are claimed**.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - The player who controls the **most cells** wins.
  - If both players control an equal number of cells, apply the **Tie-Breaker Rule**.

### Tie-Breaker Rule

- If there's a tie in the number of cells controlled:
  - The player with the **highest sum of unused challenge numbers** wins.
- If still tied:
  - The game proceeds to **Sudden Death**:
    - Players take turns challenging opponent's cells until the tie is broken.

## Scoring

- **Cell Control**: Each cell you control at the end of the game counts as one point.
- **Unused Challenge Numbers**: Total value of your unused numbers, used only in tie-breaker situations.

### End of Game Scenario

  - Player 1 controls cells: `1`, `4`, `5`, `8` (4 cells).
  - Player 2 controls cells: `2`, `3`, `6`, `7`, `9` (5 cells).
- **Winner**: Player 2

### Tie-Breaker Scenario

- **Cells Controlled**: Both players control `4` cells.
- **Unused Challenge Numbers**:

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

### Claiming an Empty Cell

- **Player 1's Turn**:

  ```
  It's your turn, Player 1.
  Available actions: [claim] an empty cell, [challenge] an opponent's cell.
  Enter your action: claim
  Enter the cell number you wish to claim (available cells: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9): 5
  You have claimed cell 5.
  ```

### Challenging an Opponent's Cell

- **Player 2's Turn**:

  ```
  It's your turn, Player 2.
  Available actions: [claim] an empty cell, [challenge] an opponent's cell.
  Enter your action: challenge
  Enter the cell number you wish to challenge (opponent's cells: 5): 5
  Select a challenge number from your available numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: 5
  Waiting for Player 1 to select their challenge number...
  Challenge results:
  - Your number: 5
  - Opponent's number: 4
  You win the challenge and now control cell 5.
  ```

### Attempting to Use a Spent Number

- **Player 1's Turn**:

  ```
  It's your turn, Player 1.
  Available actions: [claim] an empty cell, [challenge] an opponent's cell.
  Enter your action: challenge
  Enter the cell number you wish to challenge (opponent's cells: 5): 5
  Select a challenge number from your available numbers [1, 2, 3, 5]: 4
  Error: Number 4 has already been used. Please select a valid number.
  ```

## Strategy Tips

- **Manage Your Challenge Numbers**: Use higher numbers strategically, as they cannot be reused.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Keep track of numbers your opponent has used.
- **Cell Priority**: Focus on controlling key positions that may give you an advantage.
- **Plan for Tie-Breakers**: Retain higher unused numbers if you anticipate a tie.

## Conclusion

"Grid Conquest" is a strategic game that combines territory control with resource management. By carefully choosing when to claim cells and when to challenge, and by judiciously using your limited challenge numbers, you can outmaneuver your opponent and dominate the grid.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
