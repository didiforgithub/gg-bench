## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **1. Actions**

#### **Attack**

- **Effect:**
  - Deals **3 damage** to the opponent.
- **Defending Effect:**
  - If the opponent chooses to **Defend** on their next turn, the damage from your Attack is **reduced by 2** (from 3 damage to 1 damage).
  - The damage reduction applies **after** the opponent's Defend action.
  - **Example:**
    - You Attack (deal 3 damage).
    - Opponent chooses to Defend on their next turn.
    - Opponent reduces damage from your Attack by 2.
    - Opponent's HP is adjusted accordingly.

#### **Defend**

- **Effect:**
  - Reduces damage taken from the opponent's **previous Attack** by **2**.
- **Attacker's Action:**
  - If the opponent did **not Attack** on their previous turn, Defend has **no effect**.
- **Consecutive Defends:**
  - If both players Defend consecutively, there is **no additional effect**.

### **2. Restrictions on Actions**

- **Consecutive Actions:**
  - A player **cannot choose the same action more than twice in a row**.

    - On Turn 5, you cannot Attack a third time in a row; you must Defend.

### **3. Calculating Damage**

- **Timing:**
  - Damage is applied **immediately** after a player declares an Attack.
- **Defending Adjustment:**
  - If the opponent Defends on their next turn, the damage from the previous Attack is **adjusted**.
  - **Example:**
    - You Attack (opponent's HP reduces by 3).
    - Opponent Defends (reduces damage by 2).
    - Opponent's HP increases by 2 (adjusted damage is 1).
