## Strategy Tips

- **Predict Opponent's Moves:**  
  Anticipate whether your opponent will attack, defend, or charge to choose the most effective action.

- **Use Charge Wisely:**  
  Charging can turn the tide but leaves you vulnerable. Consider your opponent's likely actions.

- **Defend at the Right Time:**  
  Defending can negate damage but doesn't help you reduce your opponent's HP. Use it when you expect a powerful attack.

- **Keep Track of Previous Actions:**  
  Remembering what actions your opponent has taken can inform your strategy for future turns.
