The action space indices in the game map to specific moves as follows:

- **0**: Remove 1 number from the left end.
- **1**: Remove 2 numbers from the left end.
- **2**: Remove 3 numbers from the left end.
- **3**: Remove 1 number from the right end.
- **4**: Remove 2 numbers from the right end.
- **5**: Remove 3 numbers from the right end.

Each action index corresponds to a side (left or right) and a quantity of consecutive numbers to remove from that chosen side.
