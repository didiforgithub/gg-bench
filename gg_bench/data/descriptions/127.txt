# Digit Deletion Duel

## Objective

Be the last player to make a valid move by strategically deleting digits from a shared number to create new numbers divisible by a specified divisor. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses the game.

## Setup

- **Initial Number**: The game begins with a large positive integer, agreed upon by both players before the game starts. For example, `N = 123456789`.
- **Divisor**: A positive integer divisor `D` is selected. The default divisor is `3` unless players agree on a different number.
- **Players**: Two players participate, taking turns.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (`N`)**: The current number from which digits will be deleted.
- **Divisor (`D`)**: The number that the resulting numbers must be divisible by after each turn.
- **Digits**: Individual numerals (`0-9`) that compose the shared number.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their moves by specifying the position of the digit to delete.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Player Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must:
    1. **Select One Digit**: Choose a single digit from the current number `N` to delete.
    2. **Delete Digit**: Remove the selected digit, ensuring the remaining digits stay in their original order.
    3. **Check Divisibility**: Verify that the new number is divisible by the divisor `D`.

- **Progression**:
  - The new number becomes the current number `N` for the next player's turn.
  - The game continues with players alternating turns and following the same rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Deletion**:
   - Only one digit can be deleted per turn.
   - The digits' order must not be changed. The remaining digits shift to fill the gap left by the deleted digit.
   - Example: Deleting the second digit in `12345` results in `1345`.

2. **Divisibility Requirement**:
   - After deleting a digit, the new number must be divisible by the divisor `D`.
   - If the new number is not divisible by `D`, the move is invalid, and the player must choose a different digit.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if:
     - Exactly one digit is deleted.
     - The resulting number is divisible by `D`.
   - If no valid moves are available on a player's turn, they lose the game.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts an invalid move, they must try again.
   - Repeated invalid attempts indicate that no valid moves are available, resulting in a loss.

5. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The last player to make a valid move wins.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: Victory is achieved by being the last player to make a valid move.
- **No Points System**: There is no point tracking; the focus is on strategic play to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

## Examples

### Example 1: Gameplay Illustration

**Initial Setup**:

- Starting Number `N`: `123456`
- Divisor `D`: `3`

**Turn Sequence**:

1. **Player 1**:
   - **Current Number**: `123456`
   - **Possible Moves**:
     - Deleting any digit that results in a number divisible by `3`.
   - **Action**: Deletes the digit at position 1 (`1`).
   - **New Number**: `23456` (which sums to `2+3+4+5+6=20`, not divisible by `3`). Invalid move.
   - **Retry**: Deletes the digit at position 2 (`2`).
   - **New Number**: `13456` (sum is `1+3+4+5+6=19`). Invalid.
   - **Retry**: Deletes the digit at position 3 (`3`).
   - **New Number**: `12456` (sum is `1+2+4+5+6=18`, which is divisible by `3`).
   - **Result**: Valid move.

2. **Player 2**:
   - **Current Number**: `12456`
   - **Action**: Deletes the digit at position 5 (`6`).
   - **New Number**: `1245` (sum is `1+2+4+5=12`, divisible by `3`).
   - **Result**: Valid move.

3. **Player 1**:
   - **Current Number**: `1245`
   - **Action**: Deletes the digit at position 2 (`2`).
   - **New Number**: `145` (sum is `1+4+5=10`). Invalid.
   - **Retry**: Deletes the digit at position 3 (`4`).
   - **New Number**: `125` (sum is `1+2+5=8`). Invalid.
   - **Retry**: Deletes the digit at position 4 (`5`).
   - **New Number**: `124` (sum is `1+2+4=7`). Invalid.
   - **No Valid Moves**: Player 1 cannot make a valid move.
   - **Result**: Player 2 wins.

### Example 2: Command-Line Interaction

**Starting Number**: `98765`
**Divisor**: `5`

**Gameplay**:

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Number: 98765
  Your Move: Delete digit at position 5
  New Number: 9876
  Is 9876 divisible by 5? No
  Invalid move. Try again.
  Your Move: Delete digit at position 4
  New Number: 9875
  Is 9875 divisible by 5? Yes
  Valid move.
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Number: 9875
  Your Move: Delete digit at position 1
  New Number: 875
  Is 875 divisible by 5? Yes
  Valid move.
  ```

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Number: 875
  Your Move: Delete digit at position 2
  New Number: 85
  Is 85 divisible by 5? Yes
  Valid move.
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Number: 85
  Your Move: Delete digit at position 1
  New Number: 5
  Is 5 divisible by 5? Yes
  Valid move.
  ```

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  ```
  Current Number: 5
  No digits left to delete.
  You cannot make a valid move.
  Player 2 wins!
  ```

## Strategy Tips

- **Planning Ahead**: Consider the impact of your move on future possibilities. Deleting certain digits may limit valid moves for you or your opponent in subsequent turns.
- **Divisibility Rules**: Familiarize yourself with quick tests for divisibility to make efficient decisions.
- **Forcing Moves**: Aim to leave numbers that are challenging for your opponent to work with.

## Summary

Digit Deletion Duel is a strategic two-player game that tests numerical skills and foresight. By carefully selecting which digits to delete, players can control the flow of the game and outmaneuver their opponent. Simple to learn yet rich in tactics, this game offers an engaging experience that ends decisively without draws.

Enjoy the duel, and may the best strategist win!
