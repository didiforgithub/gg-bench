In the game environment, each action is represented by an index in the action space. This index corresponds to a specific move where a composite number is split into two integers. The mapping is precomputed based on all possible valid splits for composite numbers within the range defined by the environment. The `all_actions` list holds tuples of the form `(n, a, b)`, where `n` is a composite number, and `a` and `b` are the integers it can be split into. The action space index directly corresponds to an entry in this `all_actions` list, facilitating easy lookup of the move parameters (composite number and its split) during game play.
