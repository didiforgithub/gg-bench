In the game, the action space indices (0 to 24) correspond directly to the positions on the 5x5 grid, read in row-major order. This means:

- Index 0 represents the cell at row 0, column 0 (top-left).
- Index 1 represents the cell at row 0, column 1.
- ...
- Index 4 represents the cell at row 0, column 4 (end of the first row).
- Index 5 represents the cell at row 1, column 0 (start of the second row).
- ...
- Index 24 represents the cell at row 4, column 4 (bottom-right).

Each index identifies a unique cell in the grid that a player can select as their move.
