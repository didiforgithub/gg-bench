In the Factor Chain game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 99, representing possible numbers from 1 to 100 in the game. Each index `i` in the action space corresponds to the move of adding the number `i + 1` to the sequence. This mapping allows players to select an action by its index, which directly corresponds to the game number they wish to play. The environment processes these actions by converting the index back to the game number using the formula `number = action_index + 1`.
