In the gym environment for the Number Collapse game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(N_max)`, which represents the possible moves a player can make by indexing the range from 0 to `N_max - 1`. Each index corresponds to subtracting the divisor indicated by its value from the current number `N`, as long as this value is a proper divisor of `N` (except for 0 and 1, which are invalid since they do not qualify as proper divisors). Valid actions are those indices that correspond to proper divisors of the current number `N`, allowing the subtraction to precisely reduce `N` by a divisor that leaves no remainder.
