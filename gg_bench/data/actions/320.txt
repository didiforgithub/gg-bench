In the game, the action space is defined with two discrete actions, represented by indices: `0` corresponds to the 'Charge' move (increasing the player's Attack Power by 1), and `1` corresponds to the 'Attack' move (dealing damage equal to the player's current Attack Power to the opponent and resetting the Attack Power to 1).
