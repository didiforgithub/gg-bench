In the CustomEnv gym environment for the "Last Digit Zero" game, each action space index (0 to 7) corresponds to a multiplier in the range of 2 to 9. The mapping is as follows: action index 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2, action index 1 to a multiplier of 3, and so on up to action index 7, which corresponds to a multiplier of 9. This means that the available moves (multipliers) are directly linked to the action indices by adding 2 to the index value.
