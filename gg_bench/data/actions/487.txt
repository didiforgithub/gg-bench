The action space in the game maps indices from 0 to 98 to the possible moves by associating each index `a` with the divisor `a + 2`. Since the valid divisors for the Shared Number range from 2 to 100, the action index 0 corresponds to dividing by 2, index 1 corresponds to dividing by 3, and so on, up to index 98 which corresponds to dividing by 100. This mapping ensures that every action index represents a division by a proper divisor, considering only the even divisors greater than 1 and less than or equal to the initial Shared Number of 100.
