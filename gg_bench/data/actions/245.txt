The action space indices in the game map to moves as follows: 

- Actions 0-8 represent moving 1 space forward combined with placing a blockade on positions 1-9.
- Actions 9-17 represent moving 2 spaces forward combined with placing a blockade on positions 1-9.

Thus, each action index corresponds to a specific combination of a move distance (either 1 or 2 spaces) and a blockade placement position (from positions 1 to 9).
