In the game, the board is represented as a 5x5 grid, where each cell can be indexed by a unique action space index ranging from 0 to 24. The action space indices are mapped to the moves on the board by division and modulus operations:

- The index \( i \) from the action space corresponds to placing a symbol in the cell located at (row, column) on the board.
- The row is calculated as \( \text{row} = i \div 5 \), and the column is calculated as \( \text{col} = i \mod 5 \).

For example:
- An action index of 0 corresponds to the top-left cell (0, 0).
- An action index of 24 corresponds to the bottom-right cell (4, 4).
