In the game's action space, each action index directly corresponds to a move forward by a specific number of positions:

- **Action 0:** Move 1 position forward.
- **Action 1:** Move 2 positions forward.
- **Action 2:** Move 3 positions forward.

These actions allow the player to choose between moving 1, 2, or 3 steps on the track during their turn.
