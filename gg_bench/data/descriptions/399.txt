# **Game Title: Quantum Flip**

---

## **Objective**

The primary goal of **Quantum Flip** is to be the first player to accumulate exactly **21 points**. Players earn points by strategically flipping quantum tiles to reveal hidden values. A player wins by reaching a total score of 21 points before their opponent does. Overshooting 21 points results in a loss, adding a strategic element to decision-making.

## **Setup**

1. **Game Board**: The game uses a virtual 5x5 grid of tiles, numbered from **A1** to **E5**.
2. **Tile Values**: Each tile has a hidden value ranging from **1 to 5**.
3. **Initialization**:
   - All tiles start in a hidden state with their values concealed.
   - Players begin with a score of **0 points**.
   - Determine the first player (Player 1) randomly or by mutual agreement.

## **Game Components**

- **Tiles**:
  - **Appearance**: Represented by their grid coordinates (e.g., A1, B3) in the command-line interface.
  - **Functionality**: Flipping a tile reveals its hidden value, which is added to the player's score.
  - **Unique Attributes**: Once a tile is flipped, it cannot be flipped again.

- **Scoreboard**:
  - Displays the current scores of both players after each turn.

- **Grid Coordinates**:
  - Rows labeled **A** to **E**.
  - Columns numbered **1** to **5**.

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Step 1**: Select a tile to flip by specifying its grid coordinate (e.g., C4).
   - **Step 2**: The hidden value of the selected tile is revealed.
   - **Step 3**: The tile's value is added to the player's score.
   - **Step 4**: The tile is marked as flipped and cannot be selected again.
   - **Step 5**: The game checks for a winning condition.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After completing the steps above, the turn passes to the opponent.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Tile Selection**:
   - Players can choose any unflipped tile on the grid during their turn.

2. **Scoring Limits**:
   - **Exact Win Condition**: A player must reach **exactly 21 points** to win.
   - **Overshooting**:
     - If a player's score exceeds 21 after a flip, they **lose the game immediately**.
     - The opponent is declared the winner.

3. **Strategic Elements**:
   - **Memory**: Remembering the values of previously revealed tiles adds a layer of strategy.
   - **Probability**: Estimating the likelihood of flipping a certain value based on remaining tiles.

4. **Special Mechanics**:
   - **Quantum Flip**:
     - Once per game, a player can perform a 'Quantum Flip' instead of a regular flip.
     - **Functionality**:
       - Flip **two adjacent tiles** simultaneously.
       - Choose which one of the two revealed values to add to their score.
       - The unchosen tile remains unflipped and reverts to a hidden state.
     - **Usage**:
       - Can only be used once per player per game.
