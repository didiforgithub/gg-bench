# Cat and Mouse: A Strategic Chase on the Grid

## Objective

**Cat and Mouse** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a 5x5 grid. One player controls the **Cat**, and the other controls the **Mouse**. The primary goal varies depending on the role:

- **Mouse Player**: Navigate the Mouse from its starting position to reach the **Cheese** located at the bottom-right corner of the grid (position 5,5).
- **Cat Player**: Catch the Mouse before it reaches the Cheese by moving onto the same grid square as the Mouse.

Victory is achieved by:

- **Mouse Player**: Successfully moving the Mouse to the Cheese at position (5,5).
- **Cat Player**: Moving the Cat onto the Mouse's current position, thereby catching it.

There are no draws in this game; one player will always win by fulfilling their objective.

## Setup

1. **Game Grid**: A 5x5 grid with coordinates ranging from (1,1) at the top-left corner to (5,5) at the bottom-right corner.
2. **Starting Positions**:
   - **Mouse**: Begins at the top-left corner at position (1,1).
   - **Cat**: Begins at the bottom-left corner at position (1,5).
3. **Cheese**: Placed at the bottom-right corner at position (5,5). This is the Mouse's destination.

## Game Components

1. **Grid**: A virtual 5x5 grid represented in the command-line interface. Each cell is identified by its (x,y) coordinates.
2. **Mouse** (`M`): Represents the Mouse's current position on the grid.
3. **Cat** (`C`): Represents the Cat's current position on the grid.
4. **Cheese** (`X`): The goal position for the Mouse, located at (5,5).
5. **Empty Cells**: Represented by `.` (dot), indicating unoccupied positions on the grid.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with the **Mouse Player**.
- During each turn, the active player moves their character according to the movement rules.
- The game continues until one player achieves their objective.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

#### Mouse Movement:

- The Mouse can move to any **adjacent cell** (including diagonals), meaning it can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The Mouse moves **one cell per turn**.
- The Mouse cannot move off the grid.

#### Cat Movement:

- The Cat can move to any **adjacent cell**, but only horizontally and vertically (no diagonal movement).
- The Cat moves **one or two cells per turn**. If moving two cells, the Cat cannot change direction between the two moves; it must move in a straight line.
- The Cat cannot move off the grid.

### Additional Rules

- **Collision**: If the Cat moves onto the Mouse's current position, the Cat catches the Mouse, and the Cat Player wins.
- **Objective Completion**:
   - If the Mouse moves onto the Cheese at position (5,5), the Mouse Player wins.
- **Blocked Paths**: There are no obstacles on the grid. All cells are accessible unless occupied by the Cat or Mouse.
- **Occupied Cells**: Players cannot move onto a cell occupied by their own character but can move onto a cell occupied by the opponent as per the collision rule.

## Scoring

There is no point-based scoring system in **Cat and Mouse**. The game is won by fulfilling the victory conditions outlined in the Objective section. Winning contributes to the player's overall skill ranking if tracking multiple game sessions.
