The action space indices map to the grid cells using a row-major order, where indices 0 to 8 correspond to grid positions:

- Index 0: Move to position (0, 0)
- Index 1: Move to position (0, 1)
- Index 2: Move to position (0, 2)
- Index 3: Move to position (1, 0)
- Index 4: Move to position (1, 1)
- Index 5: Move to position (1, 2)
- Index 6: Move to position (2, 0)
- Index 7: Move to position (2, 1)
- Index 8: Move to position (2, 2)

This directly corresponds to moving the player's marker to the specified grid cell.
