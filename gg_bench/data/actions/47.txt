In the action space, indices 0 to 3 correspond to moving your token in one of four directions:

- 0: Move up
- 1: Move down
- 2: Move left
- 3: Move right

Indices 4 to 28 correspond to placing a wall on the grid:

- Each index from 4 to 28 represents a position on the 5x5 grid, calculated as `index - 4`, where this result is the linear index of the 2D grid. For instance, index 4 corresponds to the grid position (0, 0), index 5 to (0, 1), and so on up to index 28, which corresponds to the position (4, 4).
