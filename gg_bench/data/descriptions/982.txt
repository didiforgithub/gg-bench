**Arithmetic Sequence Game**

---

### **Objective**

The goal of the Arithmetic Sequence Game is for a player to be the first to collect any three numbers that can form an arithmetic sequence. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where the difference between consecutive numbers is constant. Players take turns selecting numbers from a shared pool, aiming to create such a sequence with their chosen numbers. If all numbers are chosen and neither player forms an arithmetic sequence, the last player to pick a number loses.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers ranging from **1** to **9**, inclusive. These numbers are available for selection by both players.
2. **Player Designation**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by any random method such as flipping a coin.
3. **Starting Player**: **Player 1** will take the first turn.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**: The numbers **1** through **9** form the core components of the game. Each number is unique and can only be selected once.
- **Player Holdings**: Each player has a personal collection of numbers they've selected from the pool. These numbers are visible to both players throughout the game.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- **Action on Turn**:
  - **Select a Number**: On their turn, a player selects one available number from the shared pool.
  - **Update Holdings**: The selected number is added to the player's personal collection and removed from the pool.
- **Turn Progression**: After a player selects a number and updates their holdings, it becomes the other player's turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can only select numbers that are currently available in the shared pool.
   - Each number from **1** to **9** can only be selected once during the game.

2. **Forming an Arithmetic Sequence**:
   - An **arithmetic sequence** consists of three numbers where the difference between consecutive numbers is the same. For example, **[2, 4, 6]** or **[5, 5, 5]**.
   - **Order doesn't matter**: The three numbers forming the sequence can be in any order in a player's holdings.
   - **Example Sequences**:
     - **Increasing**: 3, 5, 7 (common difference of 2)
     - **Decreasing**: 9, 6, 3 (common difference of -3)
     - **Constant**: 4, 4, 4 (common difference of 0)

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to collect any three numbers that form an arithmetic sequence wins immediately.
   - The sequence must consist of numbers from the player's own holdings only.

4. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Win Condition**: A player forms an arithmetic sequence with three of their selected numbers.
   - **Loss Condition**: If all numbers have been selected and neither player has formed an arithmetic sequence, the **last player to pick a number loses**.

5. **Visibility**:
   - Players' holdings are **public knowledge**. After each turn, both players should be aware of the numbers selected by each player.

6. **No Repetition**:
   - Once a number is selected by a player, it cannot be selected again by either player.

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**: Winning the game by forming an arithmetic sequence counts as a single win.
- **Match Play**: Players may agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

### **Example Gameplay**

#### **Example 1: Winning by Forming an Arithmetic Sequence**

1. **Starting Pool**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
2. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **5**
   - **Player 1's Holdings**: [5]
3. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Selects **3**
   - **Player 2's Holdings**: [3]
4. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **7**
   - **Player 1's Holdings**: [5, 7]
5. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Selects **1**
   - **Player 2's Holdings**: [3, 1]
6. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **9**
   - **Player 1's Holdings**: [5, 7, 9]
   - **Player 1** checks for an arithmetic sequence:
     - **Sequence**: 5, 7, 9 (common difference of 2)
     - **Player 1 Wins!**

#### **Example 2: Winning by Opponent's Last Pick**

1. **Starting Pool**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
2. **Players take turns selecting numbers but neither forms an arithmetic sequence**.
3. **Final Holdings**:
   - **Player 1**: [2, 5, 8, 9]
   - **Player 2**: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
4. **All numbers have been selected**.
5. **Since neither player has an arithmetic sequence**, the player who picked the last number loses.
   - **Player 2** picked the last number (**7**).
   - **Player 2 Loses**, **Player 1 Wins**.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Block Your Opponent**: Keep track of the numbers your opponent selects and anticipate potential sequences they might be forming. If possible, select numbers that prevent them from completing their sequence.
- **Plan Ahead**: Aim to select numbers that can form multiple sequences. For example, picking numbers like 5 allows for sequences with common differences of both 2 and -2.
- **Prioritize Middle Numbers**: Middle-range numbers (like 4, 5, 6) are more flexible for forming sequences with different common differences.
- **Force a Win**: If you can't form a sequence, try to force your opponent into a position where they can't either, ensuring you don't pick the last number.
