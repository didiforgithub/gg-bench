In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices representing the list of allowed prime multipliers `[2, 3, 5, 7]`. Specifically, action index `0` corresponds to the prime multiplier `2`, index `1` corresponds to `3`, index `2` maps to `5`, and index `3` maps to `7`. Each index in the action space directly correlates to selecting and applying the respective prime multiplier to the shared total during a player's turn.
