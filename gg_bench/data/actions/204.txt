The action space indices in the game map directly to the digits 0 through 9. Each index from 0 to 9 corresponds to selecting the digit of the same value for appending to the shared number. For example, choosing action index 0 appends digit '0' to the shared number, index 1 appends '1', and so on up to index 9 appending '9'.
