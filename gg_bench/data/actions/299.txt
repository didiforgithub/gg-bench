In the game, the action space indices (0-8) correspond to the digits 1-9. Each index represents subtracting the digit (index + 1) from the shared number. For example, choosing action 0 subtracts the digit 1, action 1 subtracts the digit 2, and so on, up to action 8, which subtracts the digit 9. This mapping allows players to select digits (1-9) for subtraction based on the current shared number's available digits.
