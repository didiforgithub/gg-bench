# Number Maze

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the target node (number 20) by strategically navigating through a numerical maze. Players move by selecting connected nodes based on specific mathematical relationships, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent and reach the end before them.

## Setup

1. **Maze Initialization**: The maze consists of nodes numbered from 1 to 20.
2. **Starting Position**: Both players begin at node **1**.
3. **Player Assignment**: Decide which player will take the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin).

## Game Components

- **Nodes**: Each node represents a number from 1 to 20.
- **Players**: Two players, each tracking their current node position.
- **Connections**: Nodes are considered connected if they satisfy the movement rules (factor or multiple relationship).

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player chosen to go first.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - Determine possible moves from the current node.
   - Select a node to move to based on the movement rules.
3. **Updating Position**: Move your player token to the new node.
4. **Turn Completion**: End your turn, allowing the next player to proceed.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Connected Nodes**: From your current node, you may move to any node that is either:
  - A **factor** of the current node (excluding the current node itself).
  - A **multiple** of the current node (up to 20).

- **Valid Moves**:
  - **Factors**: Numbers that divide evenly into the current node.
  - **Multiples**: Numbers that are evenly divisible by the current node.

- **Example**:
  - If you're on node **4**:
    - **Factors**: Move to nodes **1** or **2** (since 1 and 2 are factors of 4).
    - **Multiples**: Move to nodes **8**, **12**, **16**, or **20** (since these are multiples of 4 up to 20).

### Movement Restrictions

- **No Backtracking**: You may not move to a node you occupied on your previous turn.
- **Occupied Nodes**: Both players can occupy the same node; positions are independent.
- **Boundary**: Nodes are limited to numbers 1 through 20.

### Winning the Game

- The first player to reach **node 20** wins the game.
- **Exact Landing**: You must land exactly on node 20 by following the movement rules.
- **No Valid Moves**: If a player has no valid moves on their turn, they skip the turn.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who reaches node 20 first is declared the winner.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the movement rules and finite node options.

## Examples

### Example Turn Sequence

#### Setup

- Both players start on node **1**.

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Node**: 1
- **Possible Moves**: Since 1 is a factor and multiple of every number, Player 1 can move to any node between 2 and 20.
- **Move Chosen**: Player 1 moves to node **5**.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Current Node**: 1
- **Possible Moves**: Can move to any node between 2 and 20.
- **Move Chosen**: Player 2 moves to node **2**.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Node**: 5
- **Possible Moves**:
  - **Factors**: 1
  - **Multiples**: 10, 15, 20
- **Move Chosen**: Moves to node **10**.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Current Node**: 2
- **Possible Moves**:
  - **Factors**: 1
  - **Multiples**: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
- **Move Chosen**: Moves to node **4**.

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Current Node**: 10
- **Possible Moves**:
  - **Factors**: 1, 2, 5
  - **Multiples**: 20
- **Cannot Move to**: Node 5 (occupied last turn)
- **Move Chosen**: Moves to node **20** and wins the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Player 1 Turn:
Current Node: 1
Available Moves: 2-20
Enter your next node: 5

Player 2 Turn:
Current Node: 1
Available Moves: 2-20
Enter your next node: 2

Player 1 Turn:
Current Node: 5
Available Moves: 1, 10, 15, 20
Enter your next node: 10

Player 2 Turn:
Current Node: 2
Available Moves: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
Enter your next node: 4

Player 1 Turn:
Current Node: 10
Available Moves: 1, 2, 5, 20
Enter your next node: 20

Player 1 has reached node 20 and wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your future moves by considering the factors and multiples of potential nodes.
- **Block Paths**: Move to nodes that limit your opponent's options in subsequent turns.
- **Avoid Backtracking**: Remember you cannot return to your previous node on the next turn.

## Summary

**Number Maze** is a strategic two-player game that combines mathematical relationships with tactical movement. Players must navigate from node 1 to node 20 by moving to connected nodes defined by factor and multiple relationships. The game encourages forward-thinking and numerical understanding, providing a quick and decisive gameplay experience without the possibility of a draw.

**Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!**
