In the Arithmetic Sequence Game's gym environment, the action space is defined as `Discrete(9)`, representing indices 0 through 8. These indices map directly to the numbers 1 through 9 in the game. Thus, an action of index `i` corresponds to selecting the number `i + 1` from the shared pool of numbers 1 to 9.
