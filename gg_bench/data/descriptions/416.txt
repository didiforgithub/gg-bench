**Number Blossoms**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to complete your blossom by adding four petals connected to a central number according to specific rules. A blossom consists of a central number and up to four petal numbers. Players aim to strategically choose numbers to build their blossom before their opponent does.

---

### **Setup**

- **Players:** Two players.
- **Number Pool:** A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9** inclusive.
- **Blossoms:** Each player has their own blossom, initially empty.

**Initial Steps:**

1. **Determine Turn Order:** Decide who will be Player 1 and Player 2 (can be random or agreed upon).
2. **Choose Central Numbers:**
   - Starting with Player 1, each player selects a central number for their blossom from the number pool.
   - The central number is unique to each player.
   - Once chosen, remove the central numbers from the number pool.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Blossom Diagram (Conceptual):** Each player's blossom consists of:
  - **Central Number:** The core of the blossom.
  - **Petals:** Up to four numbers connected to the central number.
- **Number Pool:** The shared set of numbers **1-9**, minus any numbers already selected as central numbers or petals.

---

### **Turns**

- The game is played in turns, alternating between Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Choose a Petal Number:**
     - Select a number from the current number pool.
     - The chosen number must satisfy the petal placement rules.
  2. **Update Blossom and Pool:**
     - Add the selected number to your blossom as a petal.
     - Remove the number from the number pool.
  3. **Passing a Turn:**
     - If no valid moves are available, the player passes their turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Central Number Selection:**
   - Must be chosen from the number pool on the player's first turn.
   - Represents the core of the player's blossom.
   - Cannot be changed once selected.

2. **Adding Petals:**
   - On each turn after selecting the central number, a player attempts to add one petal to their blossom.
   - **Petal Placement Rules:**
     - The petal number must share a common factor greater than **1** with the central number (i.e., their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) > 1).
     - The petal number must not have been previously used in the player's own blossom.
     - The petal number must be available in the number pool.
   - **Example of Valid Petals:**
     - Central number **6** can have petals **2**, **3**, **4**, **6**, **9** (since GCDs are 2, 3, 2, 6, 3 respectively).

3. **Shared Number Pool:**
   - Both players draw from the same number pool.
   - Numbers removed from the pool cannot be used by either player.

4. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If a player cannot add a valid petal on their turn, they must pass.
   - Play continues to the next player.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to successfully add **four petals** to their blossom wins.
   - If both players complete their blossoms in the same round, the player who took the **first turn** wins.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition:** Complete your blossom with four valid petals before your opponent.
- **No Points System:** The game does not track points; the focus is on strategic completion.

### **Ensure Strategic Depth**

- **Choosing the Central Number Wisely:**
  - Opt for numbers with multiple factors (e.g., 6 has factors 1, 2, 3, 6) to maximize petal options.
  - Avoid prime numbers as central numbers since they have limited or no valid petals.
  
- **Managing the Number Pool:**
  - Keep track of numbers your opponent may need and consider selecting them proactively.
  - Be mindful of the numbers remaining in the pool to plan your future moves.

- **Anticipating Opponent's Moves:**
  - Observe your opponent's blossom to predict their next possible moves.
  - Use this information to strategize your own number selections.
