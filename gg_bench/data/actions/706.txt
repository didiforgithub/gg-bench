In the gym environment for the "Divide and Conquer" game, the action space indices correspond to the indices of prime numbers in a pre-generated list of prime numbers up to a specified maximum (MAX_PRIME). Each action chosen by a player refers to dividing the current shared number \( N \) by the prime number at the respective index in this list. Thus, performing an action is equivalent to selecting a particular prime factor from the list to execute a valid division move in the game.
