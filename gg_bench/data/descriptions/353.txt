# Coordinate Conquer

## Objective

Be the first player to **claim all three of your secret target coordinates** on the grid. Use strategy and deduction to select coordinates that help you achieve your goal while hindering your opponent.

- **Victory Condition:** The first player to claim all three of their secret target coordinates wins the game.
- **Win:** Successfully claim all three of your secret coordinates.
- **Loss:** Fail to claim your three secret coordinates before your opponent claims theirs.

## Setup

1. **Create the Grid:**
   - Use a coordinate grid with rows and columns numbered from **1 to 5**, forming a 5x5 grid.
   - Coordinates are represented as `(x, y)` where `x` is the column number and `y` is the row number.

2. **Select Target Coordinates:**
   - Each player **secretly chooses three unique coordinates** from the grid as their target coordinates.
   - Write down your target coordinates privately; do not reveal them to your opponent.
   - Target coordinates must be unclaimed and can be any position on the grid.

3. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide which player will take the first turn (e.g., flip a coin).

## Game Components

- **Coordinate Grid (5x5):**
  ```
    y
    ↑
    5  (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5)
    4  (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4)
    3  (1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
    2  (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
    1  (1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1)
        ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
        1    2    3    4    5  → x
  ```
- **Player's Target Coordinates:**
  - Three secret coordinates selected by each player at the start.
  - Keep track of which targets have been claimed.

- **Claimed Coordinates:**
  - A communal record of all coordinates claimed during the game.
  - Coordinates cannot be selected again once claimed.

## Turns

- **Turn Order:**
  - Players alternate turns, starting with the player determined during setup.

- **Actions per Turn:**
  1. **Select an Unclaimed Coordinate:**
     - Choose any unclaimed coordinate on the grid by specifying its `(x, y)` values.
     - Example: "I select coordinate (3,4)."

 2. **Resolve Claims and Revelations:**
    - Based on the selected coordinate, follow the rules in the **Rules and Mechanics** section.

- **Turn Completion:**
  - The turn ends after any necessary claims or revelations have been resolved.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Coordinates:**
   - On your turn, you must select an **unclaimed** coordinate.
   - If you select a coordinate that has already been claimed, you **forfeit your turn**.

2. **Claiming Your Target Coordinate:**
   - If the selected coordinate is on **your** secret target list:
     - **Claim it** by marking it as claimed on your list.
     - **Announce** to your opponent: "I have claimed one of my target coordinates."
     - The coordinate is now considered **claimed** and cannot be selected again.

3. **Opponent's Target Coordinate:**
   - If the selected coordinate is on your **opponent's** target list:
     - Your opponent must **reveal**: "That coordinate is on my target list."
     - The coordinate becomes **claimed** and is removed from their target list.
     - They must **immediately select a new target coordinate** (see Rule 5).

4. **Shared Target Coordinates:**
   - If the selected coordinate is on **both** players' target lists:
     - The player who selected it **claims** the coordinate.
     - The opponent must remove it from their target list and select a new target (see Rule 5).
     - Announce if it was one of your target coordinates.

5. **Replacing Lost Target Coordinates:**
   - If you lose a target coordinate (because your opponent claimed it first):
     - **Immediately select a new unclaimed coordinate** as a replacement.
     - Do **not** reveal the new target to your opponent.
     - You must always have **three** target coordinates to win the game.

6. **Victory Condition:**
   - The first player to **claim all three** of their target coordinates **wins the game**.
   - If both players claim their third target coordinate on the same turn, the player who took the first turn **wins**.

## Scoring

- **No point system is used.**
- The game is won by fulfilling the victory condition outlined above.
- Keep track of claimed coordinates and remaining targets to monitor progress.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

**Setup:**

- **Player 1's Secret Targets:** (2,3), (4,1), (5,5)
- **Player 2's Secret Targets:** (1,2), (3,3), (5,5)

**Gameplay:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Selects **(3,3)**.
   - **Player 2 reveals:** "That coordinate is on my target list."
   - Coordinate **(3,3)** is now claimed.
   - **Player 2** selects a new target coordinate in secret (e.g., (2,5)).

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Selects **(4,1)**.
   - **Player 1 reveals:** "That coordinate is on my target list."
   - Coordinate **(4,1)** is now claimed.
   - **Player 1** selects a new target coordinate in secret (e.g., (1,1)).

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Selects **(5,5)**.
   - Since **both players** had (5,5) as a target:
     - **Player 1 claims** coordinate **(5,5)**.
     - **Player 2** removes (5,5) from their target list and selects a new target (e.g., (3,5)).

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Selects **(2,3)**.
   - **Player 1 reveals:** "That coordinate is on my target list."
   - Coordinate **(2,3)** is now claimed.
   - **Player 1** selects a new target coordinate in secret (e.g., (4,5)).

5. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Selects **(1,2)**.
   - **Player 2 reveals:** "That coordinate is on my target list."
   - Coordinate **(1,2)** is now claimed.
   - **Player 2** selects a new target coordinate in secret (e.g., (2,2)).

6. **Player 1's Status:**
   - Target Coordinates Claimed:
     - (5,5)
     - Replacement for (4,1): (1,1) (not yet claimed)
     - Replacement for (2,3): (4,5) (not yet claimed)
   - **Player 1 has not yet claimed all targets.**

7. **Player 2's Status:**
   - Target Coordinates Claimed:
     - None
   - Target Coordinates Remaining:
     - Replacement for (3,3): (2,5)
     - Replacement for (5,5): (3,5)
     - Replacement for (1,2): (2,2)

8. **Game Continues:**
   - Players continue selecting coordinates following the rules until one player claims all three of their target coordinates.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```

Player 2 selects a new target coordinate.

--- Player 2's Turn ---
Select a coordinate to claim: 4,1
Player 1 reveals: "That coordinate is on my target list."
Coordinate (4,1) is now claimed.
Player 1 selects a new target coordinate.

--- Player 1's Turn ---
Select a coordinate to claim: 5,5
Player 1 reveals: "That coordinate is on my target list."
Player 2 reveals: "That coordinate is on my target list."
Coordinate (5,5) is now claimed by Player 1.
Player 2 selects a new target coordinate.

--- Player 2's Turn ---
Select a coordinate to claim: 2,3
Player 1 reveals: "That coordinate is on my target list."
Coordinate (2,3) is now claimed.
Player 1 selects a new target coordinate.

--- Player 1's Turn ---
Select a coordinate to claim: 1,2
Player 2 reveals: "That coordinate is on my target list."
Coordinate (1,2) is now claimed.
Player 2 selects a new target coordinate.

[...Game continues...]

--- Game Over ---
Player 1 has claimed all three of their target coordinates!
**Player 1 wins the game.**
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Deduction:** Pay attention to which coordinates your opponent reacts to; this can give clues about their target coordinates.
- **Interference:** Try selecting coordinates that you think might be your opponent's targets to force them to select new ones.
- **Replacement Choices:** When selecting new target coordinates, choose ones less likely to be picked by your opponent.
- **Avoid Patterns:** Don't choose target coordinates that form obvious patterns on the grid.
