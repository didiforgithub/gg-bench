In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 7, each representing a multiplier from 2 to 9, respectively. The mapping is as follows:
- Action 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2.
- Action 1 corresponds to a multiplier of 3.
- Action 2 corresponds to a multiplier of 4.
- Action 3 corresponds to a multiplier of 5.
- Action 4 corresponds to a multiplier of 6.
- Action 5 corresponds to a multiplier of 7.
- Action 6 corresponds to a multiplier of 8.
- Action 7 corresponds to a multiplier of 9.

This mapping allows players to select a legal multiplier by choosing the appropriate action index.
