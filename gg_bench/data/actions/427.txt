In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.N)`, where `self.N` is the maximum number in the initial number list (e.g., 10). Each action corresponds to an index in this action space, ranging from 0 to `N-1`. The move in the game is determined by selecting the number `action + 1` from the list of available numbers. This mapping means that if you choose action `0`, it corresponds to selecting the number `1` in the game, action `1` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, and so on up to action `N-1` which corresponds to selecting the number `N`.
