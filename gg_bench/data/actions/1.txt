In the "Number Flip Duel" game environment, the action space indices map to possible moves as follows:

- **Actions 0-4:** These indices correspond to flipping a bit at positions 1 to 5 within the player's own sequence. The player's current sequence bit at the specified position is toggled (from `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`).
  
- **Actions 5-36:** These indices correspond to guessing the opponent's entire 5-bit sequence. Each index represents a specific binary sequence combination. The index is mapped to a sequence in binary form, covering all possible 32 sequences of 5 bits.
