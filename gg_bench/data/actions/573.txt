In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, meaning there are 9 possible actions corresponding to the indices 0 through 8. Each action index maps directly to a number from 1 to 9, with index 0 corresponding to the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 corresponding to the number 9. When a player selects an action, they are effectively choosing the number that corresponds to that action's index plus one. If the chosen number is valid based on the rules and available numbers, it is added to the player's sequence, otherwise the move is deemed invalid, affecting the game state accordingly.
