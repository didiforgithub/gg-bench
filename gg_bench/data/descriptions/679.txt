# Divisor Duel

## Objective

The goal of **Divisor Duel** is to be the player who reduces the **Current Number** to 1 by subtracting proper divisors of the Current Number on your turn. If a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., the Current Number is 1 or a prime number with no proper divisors), they lose the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Determine the Starting Number**:
   - Both players agree on a positive integer to start the game. This number is called the **Current Number**.
   - Recommended starting numbers for a quick game are between **20 and 100**.

2. **Assign Players**:
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. You can flip a coin or have the player who most recently performed a mathematical calculation go first.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**:
  - A positive integer that changes throughout the game based on the players' moves.
  - It is shared between both players and is updated each turn.

- **Proper Divisors**:
  - For any positive integer N, its proper divisors are all positive integers less than N that divide N without leaving a remainder, **excluding 1 and N itself**.
  - Example:
    - Proper divisors of 12 are **2, 3, 4, and 6**.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Actions on Your Turn**:
   - **Determine Proper Divisors**:
     - Find all proper divisors of the Current Number.
   - **Choose a Divisor**:
     - Select one proper divisor from the list.
   - **Subtract the Divisor**:
     - Subtract the chosen divisor from the Current Number.
   - **Update the Current Number**:
     - The result becomes the new Current Number for the next player's turn.

3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If the Current Number is 1 or a prime number (has no proper divisors), the player cannot make a move and loses the game.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Divisors**:
   - Only proper divisors (excluding 1 and the number itself) can be subtracted.
   - The chosen divisor must divide evenly into the Current Number with no remainder.

2. **Updating the Current Number**:
   - After subtraction, the Current Number must remain a positive integer greater than zero.
   - The new Current Number is used by the next player on their turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - This typically occurs when the Current Number becomes 1 or a prime number.

4. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If a player has at least one valid move, they must make a move.

5. **Game End Condition**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move.

---

## Scoring

- **Single Game Victory**:
  - The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move wins the game.

- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of games won by each player.
  - The first player to win a predetermined number of games (e.g., best of five) wins the match.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Setup**:
- Current Number: **30**
- Player 1 starts the game.

---

**Turn 1**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Proper Divisors of 30: **2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15**
  - Player 1 chooses to subtract **15**.
  - Calculation: 30 - 15 = **15**
  - **New Current Number**: **15**

---

**Turn 2**

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Proper Divisors of 15: **3, 5**
  - Player 2 chooses to subtract **5**.
  - Calculation: 15 - 5 = **10**
  - **New Current Number**: **10**

---

**Turn 3**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Proper Divisors of 10: **2, 5**
  - Player 1 chooses to subtract **5**.
  - Calculation: 10 - 5 = **5**
  - **New Current Number**: **5**

---

**Turn 4**

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Proper Divisors of 5: **None** (since 5 is prime)
  - Player 2 cannot make a move.
  - **Player 1 wins the game!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample command-line interaction for the game:

```
Game Start! Current Number is 30.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter the divisor to subtract: 15
Player 1 subtracts 15 from 30.
New Current Number is 15.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 15 are: 3, 5
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
Player 2 subtracts 5 from 15.
New Current Number is 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 10 are: 2, 5
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
Player 1 subtracts 5 from 10.
New Current Number is 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 5 are: None
Player 2 cannot make a move.
Player 1 wins the game!

Game Over.
```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Anticipate the results of your moves to avoid leaving your opponent with advantageous numbers.
  - Consider how your move will affect the options available to your opponent.

- **Prime Numbers**:
  - Aim to reduce the Current Number to a prime number on your opponent's turn, forcing them into a position where they cannot move.

- **Optimal Subtractions**:
  - Sometimes subtracting the smallest proper divisor is the best move to control the flow of the game.

- **Avoiding Traps**:
  - Be cautious of moves that might seem beneficial but could lead to a loss in subsequent turns.

## Tips for Coding the Game

- **Determine Proper Divisors**:
  - Create a function to calculate all proper divisors of a given number.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensure that the player's chosen divisor is valid and is a proper divisor of the Current Number.

- **Game Loop**:
  - Implement a loop that alternates turns between the two players until the game ends.

- **Win Condition**:
  - Check after each turn if the Current Number has become 1 or a prime number to determine if the game has ended.

- **User Interface**:
  - Display clear prompts and messages to guide players through the game.
