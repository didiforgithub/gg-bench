In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is discrete and corresponds to the list of prime numbers up to 100. Each index in the action space represents a distinct prime number. When a player selects an action, the index chosen corresponds to the prime number to divide the current value of N. The valid moves for a player are determined by identifying which prime numbers, from this list, exactly divide the current N without a remainder. The chosen action must be one of these valid primes for the move to be valid.
