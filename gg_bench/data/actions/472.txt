The action space indices (0 to 98) correspond directly to the numbers 2 to 100 by mapping an action index `i` to the number `i + 2`. Therefore, the action index 0 represents the number 2, the action index 1 represents the number 3, and so on, up to action index 98, which represents the number 100. This mapping allows players to select numbers within the valid game range by choosing the corresponding action index.
