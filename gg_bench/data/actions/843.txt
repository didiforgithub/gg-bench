In the Inversion Race game environment, the action space is defined using a discrete set of two possible actions. These actions are mapped to the player's movement as follows:

- Action 0: Move the player's marker one cell to the left (`-1`).
- Action 1: Move the player's marker one cell to the right (`+1`).
