# Quad Block

## Objective

Be the first player to form a connected group of **exactly four** of your own markers on a 5x5 grid. The markers must be orthogonally adjacent (connected horizontally or vertically). Forming a group larger than four does not count towards a win. Strategic placement is key to build your own group while preventing your opponent from forming theirs.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, consisting of 25 cells numbered from 1 to 25.
2. **Marker Assignment**:
   - **Player 1** uses the marker `'X'`.
   - **Player 2** uses the marker `'O'`.
3. **Starting Condition**: The grid starts empty. Players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid represented in the command-line interface, with cells numbered for easy reference.
  
  ```
   1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
   6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
  11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
  16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
  21  | 22  | 23  | 24  | 25
  ```

- **Markers**:
  - `'X'` for Player 1.
  - `'O'` for Player 2.
  
- **Turn Indicator**: Keeps track of whose turn it is.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player chosen to go first during setup.
2. **Action per Turn**: On your turn, place your marker on any empty cell by specifying the cell number.
3. **Turn Progression**: After placing a marker, check for a winning condition. If none, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Placing Markers**:
   - You can place your marker on **any empty cell** by entering the cell's number.
   - Once placed, markers do not move or get removed (except during sudden-death, see below).

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - **Form a connected group of exactly four of your own markers**.
   - Markers must be **orthogonally adjacent** (horizontal or vertical neighbors).
   - Diagonal adjacency does **not** count.
   - **Groups larger than four do not qualify** for a win. Be careful not to create a connected group of five or more.

3. **Blocking**:
   - You can place markers to block your opponent's potential groups.
   - Strategic placement is essential to prevent your opponent from winning while setting up your own win.

4. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Win**: First player to form a valid group of exactly four connected markers wins.
   - **Draw**: The game is designed to avoid draws. However, if the grid is completely filled without any player forming a valid group, proceed to sudden-death.
   
5. **Sudden-Death Phase**:
   - If no valid groups are formed when the grid is full, players enter sudden-death.
   - **During Sudden-Death**:
     - Players take turns **relocating one of their own markers** to an empty cell.
     - Normal placement rules apply.
     - The first to form a valid group during this phase wins.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who forms a connected group of exactly four markers wins.
- **No Points System**: The game is win/loss based with no point tracking.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

#### Prompt for Turn

```
Player 1 ('X'), enter the cell number to place your marker: 13
```

#### After Placing Marker

```
Current Grid:
   1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
   6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
  11  | 12  | 'X'| 14  | 15
  ----+-----+-----+-----+----

  ----+-----+-----+-----+----
  21  | 22  | 23  | 24  | 25
```

#### Next Player's Turn

```
Player 2 ('O'), enter the cell number to place your marker: 8
```

#### Continuation

The game continues with each player prompted to enter their move, the grid updating after each move, and checking for the winning condition after each turn.

## Strategic Tips

- **Balance Offense and Defense**: While aiming to connect your own markers, be mindful of your opponent's formations.
- **Avoid Overconnection**: Be cautious not to create a group larger than four, as it does not count towards a win.
- **Plan Ahead**: Think multiple moves ahead to set traps and create opportunities for victory.
- **Control the Center**: Occupying central cells can give you more options for connecting markers.

## Conclusion

Quad Block is a game of strategy and foresight. Quick to learn but with depth for skilled play, it provides a competitive experience where every move counts. Place your markers wisely, and may the best strategist win!
