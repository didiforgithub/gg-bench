The action space indices map directly to specific moves for the player's soldiers in the game as follows:

- Index `0`: Move Soldier 1 forward by 1 position.
- Index `1`: Move Soldier 1 forward by 2 positions.
- Index `2`: Move Soldier 2 forward by 1 position.
- Index `3`: Move Soldier 2 forward by 2 positions.

These indices provide discrete options for each player's turn, representing movement choices within the defined game rules.
