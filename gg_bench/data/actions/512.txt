The action space indices in the gym environment represent digits from 1 to 9 using zero-based indexing. Each index \(i\) corresponds to the digit \(i+1\). Therefore, the action taken is translated by adding 1 to the action index, effectively mapping the index 0 to the digit 1, index 1 to the digit 2, and so on, up to index 8 mapping to the digit 9. This mapping ensures that the actions reflect the possible digits players can subtract from the current number \(N\) in the game.
