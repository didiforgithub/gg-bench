In the Sum Slinger game environment, the action space consists of discrete actions represented by indices `0` to `8`. Each index corresponds to selecting a number from the shared pool. Specifically, action index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `1`, action index `1` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, and so on, with action index `8` corresponding to selecting the number `9`. This whole-number mapping ensures that players choose numbers between `1` and `9` inclusively by selecting the corresponding action index.
