# Divisor Duel

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move. Players take turns reducing a shared number by subtracting its proper divisors. The player who forces the opponent into a position where they cannot make a move wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Initial Number Selection**:
   - Decide on a starting positive integer **N** (greater than 1) to be used for the game. For a quick game, a number between 10 and 100 is recommended.
   - Alternatively, the game can randomly select a starting number within a predefined range.

2. **Player Assignment**:
   - Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Determine who will take the first turn (e.g., flip a coin, random selection, or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that both players will manipulate during the game.
- **Proper Divisors**: For any given number **N**, its proper divisors are all positive integers less than **N** that divide **N** without leaving a remainder.
  - Example: Proper divisors of 8 are 1, 2, and 4.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with the designated first player.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: The current player lists all proper divisors of the current number **N**.
  2. **Subtract a Divisor**: The player selects one proper divisor and subtracts it from **N**.
  3. **Update N**: The result becomes the new **N** for the next turn.
  4. **Check for Victory**: If the new **N** is 1 or if there are no proper divisors for the new **N**, the next player cannot make a move, and the current player wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On each turn, a player must subtract a proper divisor of the current number **N**.
   - The chosen proper divisor must be a positive integer less than **N** that divides **N** evenly.

2. **Updating N**:
   - After subtracting the chosen proper divisor, the new **N** is calculated:
     \[ N_{\text{new}} = N_{\text{current}} - \text{Divisor} \]

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if they reduce **N** such that the opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - This occurs when:
     - The new **N** is 1 (which has no proper divisors).
     - The new **N** is a prime number (its only proper divisor is 1).
     - The new **N** has no proper divisors (e.g., when **N** is 2).

4. **Forbidden Moves**:
   - Players cannot subtract numbers that are not proper divisors of **N**.
   - Players cannot pass their turn; a move must be made if possible.

5. **Example of Proper Divisors**:
   - For **N = 15**, the proper divisors are 1, 3, and 5.
   - For **N = 16**, the proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8.

## Scoring

- **Winning Player**: The player who successfully forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking; the outcome is simply a win or loss.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall match winner.
  - Best-of-three or best-of-five formats can be used for longer play sessions.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number**: N = 15

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Proper Divisors of 15**: 1, 3, 5
- **Move**: Subtract 5
- **Calculation**: 15 - 5 = 10
- **New N**: 10

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Proper Divisors of 10**: 1, 2, 5
- **Move**: Subtract 5
- **Calculation**: 10 - 5 = 5
- **New N**: 5

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Proper Divisors of 5**: 1
- **Move**: Subtract 1
- **Calculation**: 5 - 1 = 4
- **New N**: 4

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Proper Divisors of 4**: 1, 2
- **Move**: Subtract 2
- **Calculation**: 4 - 2 = 2
- **New N**: 2

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Proper Divisors of 2**: 1
- **Move**: Subtract 1
- **Calculation**: 2 - 1 = 1
- **New N**: 1

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **No Valid Moves**: The number is now 1, which has no proper divisors.

**Result**: **Player 1 Wins**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Assuming players input their moves when prompted.

```
Game Start! The starting number is 15.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 5
You chose to subtract 5.
New N is 10.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 5
You chose to subtract 5.
New N is 5.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 5: 1
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 1
You chose to subtract 1.
New N is 4.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 4: 1, 2
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 2
You chose to subtract 2.
New N is 2.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 2: 1
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 1
You chose to subtract 1.
New N is 1.

Player 2's Turn:
No valid moves available.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

### Strategic Considerations

- **Prime Numbers**: Reducing **N** to a prime number (other than 2) can be advantageous since the opponent will only have 1 as a proper divisor to subtract.
- **Avoiding 1**: Try not to leave the opponent with **N = 1** on their turn, as this guarantees your victory.
- **Divisor Selection**: Consider the consequences of each possible move, and anticipate the opponent's potential responses.

## Additional Notes

- **Game Length**: The game typically ends quickly due to the reducing nature of **N** and the finite number of proper divisors.
- **Skill Development**: Players who can calculate proper divisors quickly and think ahead will have a strategic advantage.
- **Variations**:
  - Change the starting number **N** to adjust game difficulty.
  - Implement time limits for each turn to increase the challenge.

## Closing

**Divisor Duel** combines basic arithmetic and strategic foresight in a simple yet engaging game. Its minimal components and straightforward rules make it easy to code and play in a command-line interface. Mastery comes from understanding number properties and anticipating your opponent's moves, ensuring that skilled players can consistently outmaneuver less experienced ones.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
