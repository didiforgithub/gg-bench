# Center Square Showdown

## Objective

The objective of **Center Square Showdown** is to be the first player to move the shared token onto the center square of a 5x5 grid. Players take turns moving the token, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent and claim victory by strategically navigating the token to the center position **(Row 3, Column 3)**. The player who successfully moves the token to the center square wins the game.

## Setup

- **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid is used, with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 5.
- **Starting Position**: The shared token, represented by an asterisk `*`, starts at the top-left corner of the grid at position **(1,1)**.
- **Player Roles**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. A method such as a coin toss or mutual agreement determines who takes the first turn.

## Game Components

### Grid

- **Dimensions**: The grid consists of 5 rows and 5 columns.
- **Coordinates**: Positions on the grid are identified by their row and column numbers, ranging from 1 to 5.
- **Visualization**: The grid is displayed in the command-line interface, updating after each move to show the current position of the token.

### Token

- **Representation**: The shared token is depicted by an asterisk `*`.
- **Function**: Players move the token around the grid according to the game rules. The token is the central focus of gameplay, and its position determines the players' moves.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player determined to go first during setup.
- **Player Actions**: On their turn, a player must move the shared token one square in any of the four cardinal directions: **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**.
- **Turn Progression**: After a player makes a move, the turn passes to the other player, and this alternation continues until the game ends.
