# Number Match Duel

## Objective

### Victory Condition

- **Win**: Reduce your opponent's life points from **20 to 0**.
- **Loss**: Your own life points are reduced to zero before your opponent's.

## Setup

1. **Initial Life Points**: Both players start with **20 life points**.
2. **Deck Preparation**:
   - Create a shared deck consisting of **cards numbered 1 to 9**, with **four copies of each number** (total of 36 cards).
   - Shuffle the deck thoroughly.
3. **Drawing Hands**:
   - Each player draws **5 cards** from the top of the deck to form their starting hand.
   - Players keep their hands hidden from the opponent.

## Game Components

- **Deck of Numbered Cards**:
  - **Numbers**: Cards numbered from **1** to **9**.
  - **Quantity**: Four copies of each number, totaling **36 cards**.
  - **Appearance**: Each card displays a large, clear number from 1 to 9.
- **Player Hands**:
  - Each player's hand consists of up to **5 cards** drawn from the deck.
- **Life Points Tracker**:
  - A simple counter to keep track of each player's current life points, starting at **20**.
- **Discard Pile**:
  - A place to put used (played) cards after each turn.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

Players take turns in an alternating fashion. Each turn consists of the following phases:

1. **Attack Phase**:
   - The active player selects **one card** from their hand to play as an attack against the opponent.
2. **Defense Phase** (opponent's response):
   - The defending player checks their hand for a card that **matches the attack card's number**.
     - **If they have a matching card**:
       - They play it to **defend** against the attack.
       - Both the attack and defense cards are moved to the discard pile.
     - **If they do not have a matching card**:
       - They **cannot defend** and must reduce their life points by the **attack card's number**.
       - The attack card is moved to the discard pile.
3. **Draw Phase**:
   - Both players draw cards from the deck to replenish their hands back to **5 cards**.
     - If a player already has 5 or more cards (due to previous effects), they do not draw new cards.
     - If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

### Turn Progression

- Players alternate turns until one player's life points are reduced to zero.
- There are no skips or additional turns unless specified by special abilities (none in the base game).

## Rules and Mechanics

### Attacking

- **Playing an Attack Card**:
  - On your turn, you **must** play one card from your hand as an attack.
  - Choose strategically based on the numbers you hold and potential defense cards your opponent may have.
- **Attack Resolution**:
  - The attack card's number represents its **attack strength**.

### Defending

- **Matching Defense**:
  - The defending player may play a card from their hand that **exactly matches** the attack card's number to negate the attack.
  - Both the attack and defense cards are discarded.
- **Failed Defense**:
  - If the defending player lacks a matching card, they cannot defend against the attack.
  - They **subtract the attack card's number** from their life points.
  - Only the attack card is discarded.

### Life Points

- **Tracking Life Points**:
  - Each player starts with **20 life points**.
  - Life points are reduced when:
    - A player cannot defend against an attack.
  - **No healing mechanisms** are available in the base game.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The game ends immediately when a player's life points reach **zero or below**.
  - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

### Hand Management

- **Hand Size**:
  - Players should maintain a hand of **5 cards** whenever possible.
  - After the defense phase, both players draw cards until they have **5 cards**.
- **Deck Depletion**:
  - If the deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
  - If the deck and discard pile are both exhausted, players continue without drawing new cards.

### Card Management

- **Discarding Cards**:
  - Used attack and defense cards are placed in the **discard pile**.
- **Deck Recycling**:
  - When the draw deck is empty, the discard pile is shuffled to create a new deck.

## Scoring

- **Life Points Reduction**:
  - Life points are the primary scoring method.
  - A player's life points decrease when they fail to defend against an attack.
- **Victory**:
  - Reducing the opponent's life points to zero results in a win.
