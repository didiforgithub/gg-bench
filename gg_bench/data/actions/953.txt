In the gym environment, the action space is defined using `spaces.Discrete(self.starting_number + 1)`, where each action represents an integer in the range from 0 to `starting_number`. However, only specific actions (indices) correspond to valid game moves, which are the proper divisors of the `Current Number`. The method `valid_moves()` generates a list of these valid actions (proper divisors greater than 1 and less than the `Current Number`). Players are intended to select an action from this list of valid moves; invalid selections result in the game ending unfavorably for the acting player.
