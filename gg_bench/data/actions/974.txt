In the Sequence Duel gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 8) map directly to the numbers 1 to 9 in the game. Specifically, an action with index `i` corresponds to selecting the number `i + 1`. For instance, an action with index 0 represents choosing the number 1, index 1 corresponds to number 2, and so on, up to index 8, which corresponds to selecting the number 9. Each index represents a potential move by selecting the respective available number from the pool.
