# Number Siege: Rule Book

## Objective

In **Number Siege**, two players compete on a number line battlefield. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach the opponent's base located at the opposite end of the number line. Alternatively, a player can achieve victory by capturing the opponent by landing on their exact position during movement. The game emphasizes strategic planning and anticipation of the opponent's moves to secure a win.

## Setup

1. **Number Line Battlefield**: The game is played on a number line ranging from **0 to 10**, inclusive.
2. **Starting Positions**:
   - **Player 1 (P1)** starts at position **0**.
   - **Player 2 (P2)** starts at position **10**.
3. **Player Roles**:
   - **P1**'s base is at position **0**.
   - **P2**'s base is at position **10**.

## Game Components

- **Number Line Positions (0-10)**: Represents the battlefield where players move.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token (can be represented by their player number) indicating their current position on the number line.
- **Movement Options**: On each turn, players can choose to move **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - The game starts with **Player 1**.
   - Players alternate turns thereafter.
2. **Player Actions on Their Turn**:
   - Choose to move **1**, **2**, or **3** positions towards the opponent's base.
   - Update their position on the number line accordingly.
3. **Movement Direction**:
   - **P1** moves in the **positive direction** (increasing numbers) towards **position 10**.
   - **P2** moves in the **negative direction** (decreasing numbers) towards **position 0**.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Limitations**:
   - Players **cannot move past the opponent's base**. If a move would take a player beyond the number line (positions beyond 0 or 10), that move is not allowed.
   - Players **must choose a valid move** each turn; skipping a turn is not permitted unless no valid moves are available.
2. **Capturing the Opponent**:
   - If a player **lands on the exact position** of the opponent during their move, they **capture the opponent and win the game immediately**.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **By Reaching the Opponent's Base**: The first player to land exactly on the opponent's base position (P1 to **position 10**, P2 to **position 0**) wins.
   - **By Capture**: Capturing the opponent by landing on their current position.
4. **Collision Avoidance**:
   - If a player's move would result in **moving past the opponent's current position** without landing on it, the move is **allowed**.
5. **No Overtaking Restriction**:
   - Players can pass by each other on the number line as long as they do not land on the same position unless aiming for a capture.
6. **Valid Moves Enforcement**:
   - If a player has **no valid moves** (e.g., all possible moves would take them beyond the battlefield), they **forfeit their turn**.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who either reaches the opponent's base first or captures the opponent wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no point accumulation; the game outcome is determined by achieving the objective.
