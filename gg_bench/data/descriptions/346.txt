# Adjacency Block

## Objective

Adjacency Block is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a linear grid. Players take turns placing their tokens onto a row of cells with the goal of being the last player able to make a legal move. A player wins by successfully placing a token when their opponent cannot.

---

## Setup

- **Game Grid**: A linear row of **10 cells**, labeled from positions **1** to **10**.
- **Initial State**: All cells are empty at the start of the game.
- **Player Assignments**:
  - **Player 1**: Uses the token `'X'`.
  - **Player 2**: Uses the token `'O'`.
- Decide which player goes first (you can flip a coin or let the program choose randomly).

---

## Game Components

- **Grid**: Represents the playing area, displayed as a row with positions numbered 1 to 10.
- **Tokens**:
  - **Player 1 Token**: `'X'`.
  - **Player 2 Token**: `'O'`.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players interact with the game by entering the position number where they wish to place their token.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display** the current state of the grid.
  2. **Input**: The current player enters the position number where they wish to place their token.
  3. **Validation**: The game checks if the move is legal according to the placement rules.
     - If the move is legal, the token is placed, and the turn ends.
     - If the move is illegal, the player is prompted to choose a different position.
- The game continues until a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Placement Rules

1. **Choosing a Position**:
   - On your turn, you must place your token `'X'` or `'O'` on an **empty cell**.
2. **Adjacency Restriction**:
   - **You cannot place your token in a cell that is adjacent to any of your opponent's tokens**.
   - **Adjacency** is defined as cells immediately next to each other (e.g., positions 4 and 5 are adjacent).
   - **You can place your token adjacent to your own tokens**.
3. **Winning Condition**:
   - If you cannot make a legal move on your turn (no valid cells available), you **lose** the game.
   - Your opponent wins by default.

### Gameplay Mechanics

- Players must strategically choose where to place their tokens to maximize future placement options and limit their opponent's moves.
- Consider both offensive moves (restricting your opponent) and defensive moves (keeping your options open).

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who successfully places a token when their opponent cannot is declared the winner.
- **Match Play**: For extended play, track the number of games won by each player over multiple rounds.

## Strategies

- **Control Key Positions**: Occupy central cells to maximize your placement options.
- **Avoid Self-Blocking**: Be cautious about clustering your tokens in a way that limits your own future moves.
- **Force Opponent's Moves**: Position your tokens to restrict where your opponent can legally place theirs.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the consequences of each move, considering both current and future turns.
