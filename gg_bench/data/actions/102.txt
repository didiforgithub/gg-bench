In the game environment, the action space is defined with two discrete actions represented by indices as follows: index 0 corresponds to the move "Add 1," which increments the player's current score by 1 point, and index 1 corresponds to the move "Double," which multiplies the player's current score by 2, provided it doesn't exceed the target score of 10.
