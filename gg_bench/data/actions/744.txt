The action space in the game maps six discrete actions to specific operations on the current value as follows:

- **Action 0**: Add 1 to the current value.
- **Action 1**: Add 2 to the current value.
- **Action 2**: Add 3 to the current value.
- **Action 3**: Multiply the current value by 1.
- **Action 4**: Multiply the current value by 2.
- **Action 5**: Multiply the current value by 3.

These actions correspond to the six possible operations players can perform, reflecting the allowable additions and multiplications with numbers 1, 2, or 3.
