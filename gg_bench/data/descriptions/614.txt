# Number Tower - Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Tower** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players alternately build a tower by stacking numbered blocks according to specific mathematical rules. The primary goal is to be the last player to place a block successfully. A player wins by making a move that forces the opponent into a position where they cannot place a valid block on their turn.

---

## Setup

- **Block Pool**: A shared set of numbered blocks from **1** to **9**.
- **Tower**: Initially empty. Players will build the tower by placing blocks on top of each other during their turns.
- **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2) by mutual agreement or a random method.

---

## Game Components

### Blocks

- **Numbers**: Each block is labeled with an integer from **1** to **9**.
- **Unique Use**: Once a block is placed on the tower, it is no longer available for either player.
- **Shared Pool**: All blocks are available to both players until used.

### Tower

- **Structure**: A single stack where blocks are placed one on top of the other.
- **Visibility**: The entire sequence of blocks in the tower is visible to both players at all times.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately. Player 1 makes the first move.
2. **Turn Actions**:
   - **Select a Block**: Choose one available block from the pool.
   - **Place the Block**: Add the selected block on top of the tower following the placement rules.
3. **Turn Completion**: After placing a block, the turn passes to the other player.
4. **Unable to Move**: If a player cannot place a valid block on their turn, the game ends, and that player loses.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Block Placement Rules

1. **First Move**:
   - Any block numbered from **1** to **9** can be placed as the first block.
2. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - The block must be a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the block immediately below it.
   - **Divisor**: A number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.
   - **Multiple**: A number that is the product of another number and an integer.
   - **Example**:
     - If the block below is **4**, valid blocks to place on top are **1**, **2**, **4**, **8** (since 1, 2, and 4 are divisors of 4, and 8 is a multiple of 4).
3. **Block Availability**:
   - Only unused blocks from the pool can be selected.
   - Once a block has been placed on the tower, it cannot be used again by either player.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: A player wins by placing a block that leaves the opponent with no valid moves on their subsequent turn.
- **Losing the Game**: A player loses if, on their turn, they cannot place a valid block according to the placement rules.

## Scoring

There is no point-scoring system in **Number Tower**. The game is won by strategic block placement that leads to the opponent's inability to make a valid move.
