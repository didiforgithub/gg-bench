**Game Name:** Last Digit Duel

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to reach or exceed a target score by strategically selecting numbers based on their last digits. The primary goal is to outmaneuver your opponent by limiting their available choices while maximizing your own score.

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool:** Create a shared pool of numbers ranging from **1** to **50**. All numbers are initially unclaimed and available for selection.

2. **Target Score:** Set a target score of **100** points. The first player to reach or surpass this score wins the game.

3. **Starting Player:** Determine who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or agreement).

4. **Player Scores:** Both players start with a score of **0**.

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool (1-50):** A list of numbers from which players will select during their turns. Each number can only be selected once and is then removed from the pool.

- **Player Scores:** Each player has an individual score that accumulates based on the numbers they've selected.

- **Last Selected Number:** Tracks the most recently selected number by each player, which influences the opponent's available choices.

### **Turns**

- Players take turns alternately. Each turn consists of:

  1. **Selection Phase:** Choose an available number from the number pool based on the game rules.

  2. **Scoring Phase:** Add the selected number to the player's total score.

  3. **Update Phase:** Remove the selected number from the number pool and record it as the player's last selected number.

- **Turn Progression:** The turn passes to the opponent after the current player has completed these phases.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Turn:**

   - The first player can select **any number** from the number pool.

2. **Subsequent Turns:**

   - A player **must select** an available number that **ends with the same last digit** as the opponent's last selected number.

   - If multiple numbers share that last digit, the player can choose any of them.

   - **Example:** If the opponent's last selected number is **23** (ending with **3**), the player must choose a number ending with **3** (e.g., **3**, **13**, **33**, **43**).

3. **No Available Numbers:**

   - If no numbers are available that match the required last digit, the player **skips their turn**.

4. **Number Selection:**

   - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the number pool and cannot be chosen again.

5. **Scoring:**

   - The value of the selected number is **added** to the player's total score.

6. **Winning the Game:**

   - The game continues until a player reaches or exceeds the **target score of 100** points.

   - If both players reach or exceed 100 points in the same round, the player with the **higher score** wins.

7. **Endgame Condition:**

   - If no players can make a valid move (all numbers are exhausted or no valid last digits remain), the player with the **highest score** wins.

   - **No Draws:** There are no tie games. If scores are equal when no moves are possible, the **last player who made a selection** wins.

### **Scoring**

- **Score Calculation:**

  - Each player's score is the **sum** of the numbers they've selected throughout the game.

- **Tracking Scores:**

  - Scores should be updated and displayed after each turn for both players.

- **Winning the Game:**

  - The first player to reach a total score of **100** or more points **wins immediately**.

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Balancing Score and Control:** While higher numbers boost your score, they might also open opportunities for your opponent. Sometimes selecting a lower number might be strategically better.
