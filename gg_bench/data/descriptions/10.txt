# Zero Sum Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the **shared number** to exactly **zero** on your turn by strategically adding or subtracting numbers from **1** to **10**.

---

## Setup

- **Shared Number**: The game starts with a shared number of **20**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers from **1** to **10** are available for both players to use. Numbers can be selected multiple times without restriction.
- **Players**: Two players participate, taking turns manipulating the shared number.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A single number that both players manipulate during the game. It starts at **20** and must stay within the range of **0** to **40** throughout the game.
- **Number Selection**: Numbers from **1** to **10** that players choose to add to or subtract from the shared number.

---

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Select a Number**: On your turn, choose a number **n**, where **1 ≤ n ≤ 10**.
2. **Choose an Operation**: Decide to **add** or **subtract** the selected number to/from the shared number.
3. **Update Shared Number**: Calculate the new shared number after the operation.
   - **Addition**: Shared Number = Shared Number + n
   - **Subtraction**: Shared Number = Shared Number - n
4. **Check for Victory**: If the new shared number is exactly **0**, you win the game.
5. **Validity of Move**: Ensure the new shared number stays within **0** to **40**.
   - If the move would cause the shared number to go below **0** or above **40**, the move is invalid, and you lose your turn.

### Order of Play

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Player 1** starts the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - You may select any number from **1** to **10** on your turn.
   - You may choose to either **add** or **subtract** this number from the shared number.
   - The resulting shared number must remain between **0** and **40**, inclusive.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game is won by the player who reduces the shared number to exactly **zero** on their turn.

3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a move would cause the shared number to go below **0** or above **40**, it is invalid.
   - If you have no valid moves, you **lose your turn**.
   - If both players consecutively have no valid moves, the player who first could not make a move **loses the game**.

4. **Number Reuse**:
   - Numbers from **1** to **10** can be used multiple times by both players.

5. **Strategy**:
   - You must balance between advancing the game toward zero and preventing your opponent from winning.
   - Consider the implications of both adding and subtracting numbers in relation to the shared number and potential future moves.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by reducing the shared number to exactly **zero** on your turn.
- **Defeat**: Occurs if you cannot make a valid move and your opponent subsequently cannot make a valid move either.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Starting Shared Number**: 20

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 5
- **Action**: Subtract
- **Calculation**: 20 - 5 = **15**
- **Shared Number**: 15

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 7
- **Action**: Add
- **Calculation**: 15 + 7 = **22**
- **Shared Number**: 22

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 2
- **Action**: Subtract
- **Calculation**: 22 - 2 = **20**
- **Shared Number**: 20

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 10
- **Action**: Subtract
- **Calculation**: 20 - 10 = **10**
- **Shared Number**: 10

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 10
- **Action**: Subtract
- **Calculation**: 10 - 10 = **0**
- **Shared Number**: 0

**Result**: **Player 1 wins** by reducing the shared number to zero.

---

### Example Game 2

**Starting Shared Number**: 5

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Cannot Subtract**: Subtracting any number from 1 to 10 would result in a negative number.
- **Selects**: 5
- **Action**: Add
- **Calculation**: 5 + 5 = **10**
- **Shared Number**: 10

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 10
- **Action**: Subtract
- **Calculation**: 10 - 10 = **0**
- **Shared Number**: 0

**Result**: **Player 2 wins** by reducing the shared number to zero.

---

### Example Game 3

**Starting Shared Number**: 1

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Cannot Subtract**: Subtracting any number would result in a negative number.
- **Selects**: 9
- **Action**: Add
- **Calculation**: 1 + 9 = **10**
- **Shared Number**: 10

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Selects**: 10
- **Action**: Subtract
- **Calculation**: 10 - 10 = **0**
- **Shared Number**: 0

**Result**: **Player 2 wins** by reducing the shared number to zero.
