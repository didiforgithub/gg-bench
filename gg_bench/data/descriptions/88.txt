# Operation Target: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

**Operation Target** is a strategic two-player game where the primary goal is to be the first player to reach the **Target Number** exactly. Players take turns applying mathematical operations to a **Current Number**, navigating operational restrictions to outmaneuver their opponent. The game requires foresight and planning, ensuring that a skilled player can consistently secure victory over an unskilled opponent.

## Setup

1. **Choose the Target Number**: Agree upon a positive integer to serve as the Target Number for the game. For a standard game, the Target Number is **23**, but players may choose any suitable number for variation.

2. **Initialize the Current Number**: Set the Current Number to **1** at the start of the game.

3. **Determine the First Player**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

## Game Components

- **Target Number**: The specific positive integer that players aim to reach exactly.
  
- **Current Number**: The number that is modified each turn based on players' chosen operations. It begins at **1** and changes as the game progresses.

- **Allowed Operations**:
  - **Addition (+1)**: Add 1 to the Current Number.
  - **Multiplication (×2)**: Multiply the Current Number by 2.

- **Operational Record**:
  - Each player keeps track of the operation they performed on their previous turn to adhere to operational restrictions.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Review Restrictions**: Before choosing an operation, the player must consider which operation they performed on their previous turn.
  2. **Select an Operation**: Choose either addition (+1) or multiplication (×2), adhering to the operational restrictions.
  3. **Apply the Operation**: Perform the chosen operation on the Current Number.
  4. **Update the Current Number**: The result becomes the new Current Number.
  5. **Check for Victory/Loss**:
     - If the Current Number exactly equals the Target Number, the player wins.
     - If the Current Number exceeds the Target Number, the player loses immediately.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Operational Choices**:
   - On each turn, a player may choose to:
     - **Add 1** to the Current Number, or
     - **Multiply** the Current Number **by 2**.

2. **Operational Restrictions**:
   - A player **cannot choose the same operation** that they performed on their **previous turn**.
   - Players **are allowed** to choose the operation that their **opponent** used on the preceding turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a Current Number that is **exactly equal** to the Target Number **wins** the game.

4. **Exceeding the Target Number**:
   - If a player's operation results in a Current Number that **exceeds** the Target Number, they **immediately lose** the game.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players **must** perform an operation on their turn. If both operations are disallowed by the rules, the player loses (though this situation cannot occur under the operational restrictions provided).

### Example of Operational Restrictions

- If **Player A** performed **addition (+1)** on their previous turn, they **cannot** choose addition on their current turn but may choose multiplication (×2).
  
- **Player B** is not restricted by Player A's previous operation and may choose either operation unless restricted by their own previous turn's operation.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by the player who reaches the Target Number exactly.
  
- **Defeat**: Occurs when a player's operation causes the Current Number to exceed the Target Number.

- There are no points or secondary scoring methods; the outcome is determined solely by which player achieves the objective.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

- **Target Number**: 23

- **Current Number**: Starts at 1

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Previous Operation**: None
   - **Available Operations**: Add 1 or Multiply by 2
   - **Chooses**: Multiply by 2
   - **Calculation**: 1 × 2 = 2
   - **Current Number**: 2

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Previous Operation**: None
   - **Available Operations**: Add 1 or Multiply by 2
   - **Chooses**: Multiply by 2
   - **Calculation**: 2 × 2 = 4
   - **Current Number**: 4

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Previous Operation**: Multiply by 2
   - **Cannot Choose**: Multiply by 2
   - **Available Operation**: Add 1
   - **Chooses**: Add 1
   - **Calculation**: 4 + 1 = 5
   - **Current Number**: 5

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Previous Operation**: Multiply by 2
   - **Cannot Choose**: Multiply by 2
   - **Available Operation**: Add 1
   - **Chooses**: Add 1
   - **Calculation**: 5 + 1 = 6
   - **Current Number**: 6

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Previous Operation**: Add 1
   - **Cannot Choose**: Add 1
   - **Available Operation**: Multiply by 2
   - **Chooses**: Multiply by 2
   - **Calculation**: 6 × 2 = 12
   - **Current Number**: 12

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Previous Operation**: Add 1
   - **Cannot Choose**: Add 1
   - **Available Operation**: Multiply by 2
   - **Chooses**: Multiply by 2
   - **Calculation**: 12 × 2 = 24
   - **Current Number**: 24
   - **Result**: Exceeds the Target Number (23). **Player 2 loses**.

7. **Outcome**:
   - **Player 1 wins** as Player 2 exceeded the Target Number.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the operational restrictions on future turns. Choose operations that set you up for favorable options on your next turn.

- **Control the Current Number**: Keep the Current Number within a range that offers you flexibility while pressuring your opponent.

- **Force Mistakes**: Maneuver the Current Number to values that may compel your opponent to exceed the Target Number or limit their operational choices.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is how the game might proceed in a command-line interface:

```
Game Start!
Target Number: 23
Current Number: 1

Player 1's Turn:
Previous Operation: None
Available Operations: [1] Add 1, [2] Multiply by 2
Enter the number of your chosen operation: 2
You chose to Multiply by 2.
New Current Number: 2

Player 2's Turn:
Previous Operation: None
Available Operations: [1] Add 1, [2] Multiply by 2
Enter the number of your chosen operation: 2
You chose to Multiply by 2.
New Current Number: 4

Player 1's Turn:
Previous Operation: Multiply by 2
Available Operation: [1] Add 1
Enter the number of your chosen operation: 1
You chose to Add 1.
New Current Number: 5

Player 2's Turn:
Previous Operation: Multiply by 2
Available Operation: [1] Add 1
Enter the number of your chosen operation: 1
You chose to Add 1.
New Current Number: 6

Player 1's Turn:
Previous Operation: Add 1
Available Operation: [1] Multiply by 2
Enter the number of your chosen operation: 1
You chose to Multiply by 2.
New Current Number: 12
