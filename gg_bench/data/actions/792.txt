The action space indices are mapped to the moves in the game using a base-5 counting system. Each action index, ranging from 0 to 124, corresponds to a unique three-digit code composed of digits from 1 to 5. To derive the code from an index:

1. Divide the index by 25 to get the first digit, `d1` (results range from 0 to 4). Add 1 to shift the range to 1-5.
2. Use the remainder of the index divided by 25 to calculate the second digit, `d2`, by dividing it by 5. Again, add 1 to shift the range.
3. The remainder now becomes the third digit, `d3`, to which we also add 1.

Thus, each index uniquely corresponds to a code formed by the digits (d1+1, d2+1, d3+1).
