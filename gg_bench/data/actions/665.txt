In the GridLock game environment, the action space indices map directly to the grid positions. The grid is a 5x5 matrix, and there are 25 possible actions, one for each cell. The index in the action space corresponds to a specific cell in the grid, calculated using the formula: `row = action // 5` and `col = action % 5`, where `action` is the chosen index. This formula allows each action to be translated into its respective grid coordinates, with the top-left cell being index 0 and the bottom-right cell being index 24.
