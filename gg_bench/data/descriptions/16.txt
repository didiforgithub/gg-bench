**Game Name:** Odd or Even Chase

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player able to make a legal move by strategically selecting numbers from a sequence according to specific adjacency and parity rules. The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a legal move wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Line Creation:**
   - Create a linear sequence of consecutive integers from **1** to **12**. This sequence represents the number line for the game.
   - All numbers are initially unclaimed and available for selection.

2. **Player Positions:**
   - There are two players: **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - No physical positions are needed as the game is turn-based and played via command-line interface.

3. **Starting Conditions:**
   - Determine which player will take the first turn (Player 1). This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Line:**
  - A list of integers from **1** to **12**:  
    `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12`

- **Claimed Numbers:**
  - A record of numbers that have been selected and are no longer available.
  
- **Parity Rules:**
  - **Odd Numbers:** 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
  - **Even Numbers:** 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

- **Adjacency:**
  - Numbers that are directly adjacent on the number line (numerically consecutive):
    - For any number `n`, the adjacent numbers are `n-1` and `n+1`, if they exist within the range of 1 to 12.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Player 1's First Turn:**
   - Player 1 selects **any** unclaimed number from the number line.

2. **Subsequent Turns:**
   - Players alternate turns.
   - On each turn, the player must select an unclaimed number that:
     - Is **adjacent** (numerically) to the **last number** picked by their opponent.
     - Has the **opposite parity** to the last number picked by their opponent (i.e., if the opponent picked an odd number, the player must pick an even number, and vice versa).

3. **Turn Actions:**
   - **Select Number:** The player chooses a valid number based on the rules.
   - **Update Claimed Numbers:** The selected number is marked as claimed and removed from the list of available numbers.

4. **Turn Progression:**
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player cannot make a legal move.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection Rules:**
   - **Adjacency Requirement:**
     - The number must be directly adjacent to the last number selected by the opponent. That is, it must be either one less or one more than the opponent's last pick.
     - Only unclaimed numbers are considered.
   - **Parity Requirement:**
     - The number must be of the opposite parity to the opponent's last pick.
       - If the opponent picked an **odd** number, the player must pick an **even** number.
       - If the opponent picked an **even** number, the player must pick an **odd** number.

2. **Legal Moves:**
   - A move is legal if it satisfies both the adjacency and the parity requirements.
   - If there are multiple legal options, the player may choose any of them.

3. **Unavailable Moves:**
   - If a player cannot make a move because there are no unclaimed numbers that meet both criteria, they lose the game.

4. **Number Claiming:**
   - Once a number is selected, it is claimed and cannot be chosen again by either player.

5. **Game End:**
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The player who makes the last legal move is declared the **winner**.
  - The opponent who cannot make a legal move on their turn **loses**.

- **No Draws:**
  - The game is designed so that a draw is impossible under the rules provided.
