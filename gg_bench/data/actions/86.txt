The action space indices [0, 24] represent positions on the 5x5 grid. Each index corresponds to a cell in the grid, mapped linearly from top to bottom and left to right. Index 0 refers to the top-left cell (row 0, column 0), index 1 to the cell to the right of it (row 0, column 1), proceeding row by row until index 24, which represents the bottom-right cell (row 4, column 4). The mapping can be translated using row = index // 5 and column = index % 5.
