# Power Up - Rule Book

## Objective

The primary goal of **Power Up** is to be the first player to reach or exceed the target number, **256**, by strategically applying exponents to the current base number. Players take turns choosing an exponent and raising the base number to that power. The player who causes the base number to reach or surpass **256** on their turn wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Initial Base Number**: The game begins with the base number set to **2**.
2. **Target Number**: The game's objective is to reach or exceed the target number of **256**.
3. **Players**: Two players participate in the game. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Base Number**: A numerical value that changes throughout the game based on player actions. Starts at **2**.
- **Exponents**: Players can choose from the exponents **1**, **2**, or **3** on their turn.
- **Target Number**: The number **256**, which players aim to reach or exceed to win.
  
*Note*: As a command-line game, all components are represented numerically on the interface.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the designated first player.
2. **Player Actions**: On their turn, a player must:
   - Choose an exponent (**1**, **2**, or **3**).
   - Raise the current base number to the chosen exponent.
   - Update the base number for the next player's turn.
3. **Progression**: After a player completes their action, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing Exponents**:
   - Players must select an exponent of **1**, **2**, or **3** on their turn.
2. **Calculating the New Base Number**:
   - The new base number is calculated as:
     - **New Base Number** = (**Current Base Number**)<sup>**Chosen Exponent**</sup>
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Victory Condition**: If, after a player's turn, the base number is **greater than or equal to 256**, that player wins.
4. **Exceeding the Target**:
   - There is no penalty for exceeding **256**; surpassing it still results in a win.
5. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Any exponent other than **1**, **2**, or **3** is invalid and not permitted.
6. **Continuing the Game**:
   - If the new base number is less than **256**, play continues with the next player's turn.

## Scoring

- **No Points System**: There are no points or scoring; the game's outcome is based solely on reaching or exceeding the target number.
- **Winning the Game**: Victory is achieved by fulfilling the game's objective as described in the rules.

## Examples

### Example Gameplay

**Starting Base Number**: 2  
**Target Number**: 256

#### Player 1's Turn
- **Current Base Number**: 2
- **Action**: Chooses exponent **3**
- **Calculation**: 2<sup>3</sup> = 8
- **New Base Number**: 8

#### Player 2's Turn
- **Current Base Number**: 8
- **Action**: Chooses exponent **2**
- **Calculation**: 8<sup>2</sup> = 64
- **New Base Number**: 64

#### Player 1's Turn
- **Current Base Number**: 64
- **Action**: Chooses exponent **2**
- **Calculation**: 64<sup>2</sup> = 4,096
- **New Base Number**: 4,096
- **Result**: Base number exceeds 256; **Player 1 wins**

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

```
Game Start! The base number is 2. First to reach or exceed 256 wins.

Player 1's turn.
Current base number: 2
Choose an exponent (1, 2, or 3): 3
You chose exponent 3.
New base number is: 8

Player 2's turn.
Current base number: 8
Choose an exponent (1, 2, or 3): 2
You chose exponent 2.
New base number is: 64

Player 1's turn.
Current base number: 64
Choose an exponent (1, 2, or 3): 2
You chose exponent 2.
New base number is: 4096

Player 1 wins! Base number reached 4096 (target was 256).
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of different exponent choices to force your opponent into a losing position.
- **Control the Base Number**: Deciding when to increase the base number significantly can be crucial.
- **Defensive Play**: Sometimes choosing a smaller exponent to delay reaching the target can be advantageous.

## Conclusion

**Power Up** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and make calculated decisions. By carefully selecting exponents, players can influence the game's outcome and outmaneuver their opponent to achieve victory.
