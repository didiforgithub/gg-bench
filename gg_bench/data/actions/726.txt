In the gym environment for the "Multiplication Showdown" game, the action space indices (0-7) correspond directly to the allowed multipliers (2-9). Specifically, index 0 maps to multiplier 2, index 1 maps to multiplier 3, and so on, up to index 7 which maps to multiplier 9. Therefore, each action index represents a unique multiplier choice for the current number, enabling players to choose multipliers consistently within the defined range of the game rules.
