The action space indices in the gym environment correspond directly to the positions in the binary sequence of the game. Each index represents a bit position (from 0 to N-1), and choosing an index as an action means attempting to flip the bit at that position from 0 to 1. In the game's context, an action is valid if the selected bit and its adjacent bits are all 0 before the flip, ensuring compliance with the game's non-adjacent rule.
