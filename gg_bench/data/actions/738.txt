The action space indices in the game map directly to potential moves as follows: index 0 represents the "pass" action, indicating the player chooses not to make a valid move when no proper divisors are available. Indices from 1 to the maximum number (in this case, 100) are potential proper divisor actions, where each index represents dividing the current number N by that specific index if it is a proper divisor of N. If the index corresponds to a proper divisor of N, the action is valid, otherwise, it's an invalid move.
