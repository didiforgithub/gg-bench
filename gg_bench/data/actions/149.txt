The action space indices define the moves as follows:

- Indices 0 to 4 represent moves without using a defense token, with the sea level rise amount corresponding to index + 1. For example, index 0 means a sea level rise of 1 unit.

- Indices 5 to 9 represent moves using a defense token, with the sea level rise amount corresponding to index - 5 + 1. For example, index 5 means using a defense token with a sea level rise of 1 unit.
