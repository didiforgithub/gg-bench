In the gym environment for the game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(8)`, meaning there are 8 discrete actions available, corresponding to integers 0 through 7. These action indices map directly to selecting integers between 2 and 9 as follows: 
- Action index 0 maps to the integer 2,
- Action index 1 maps to the integer 3,
- Action index 2 maps to the integer 4,
- Action index 3 maps to the integer 5,
- Action index 4 maps to the integer 6,
- Action index 5 maps to the integer 7,
- Action index 6 maps to the integer 8,
- Action index 7 maps to the integer 9.

Each action index corresponds to adding 2 to the action index value to determine the selected number for the multiplication step in the game.
