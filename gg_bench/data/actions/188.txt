The action space indices in the game directly correspond to the integers ranging from 0 to `N_MAX` (inclusive). Each index represents a potential move where a player can select an integer, specifically a prime factor of the current number `N`, to divide `N`. Valid moves, therefore, correspond to indices that are prime numbers greater than 1 and are factors of `N`. Invalid moves occur when the chosen index is not a prime factor of `N`.
