# Game Name: Divisor Duel

---

### Objective

Be the last player to make a valid move by reducing the current number such that your opponent cannot make a move. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where the opponent cannot subtract a proper divisor from the current number.

---

### Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer called the **current number**. This number is agreed upon by both players before the game starts. For a standard game, the starting number is **60**.

2. **Players**: Two players participate in the game, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

3. **Starting Player**: Decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

---

### Game Components

- **Current Number**: A positive integer visible to both players at all times. It is updated after each move.

- **Proper Divisors**: For the purposes of the game, proper divisors of a number are integers greater than 1 and less than the current number that divide it evenly (without leaving a remainder).

---

### Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the designated starting player.

- **Player Actions on Their Turn**:
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: Determine all proper divisors of the current number.
  2. **Choose a Divisor**: Select any one proper divisor.
  3. **Subtract Divisor**: Subtract the chosen divisor from the current number.
  4. **Update Current Number**: The result becomes the new current number for the next turn.

---

### Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On each turn, a player must subtract a proper divisor of the current number.
   - The chosen divisor must be greater than 1 and less than the current number.
   - The divisor must divide the current number evenly.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (i.e., the current number has no proper divisors), they lose the game.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.

3. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If a valid move is possible, it must be made.

4. **No Repeats**:
   - The same move combinations can occur multiple times; there are no restrictions on repeating previous moves.

---

### Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who makes the last valid move wins the game.

- **Record Keeping**: Players may keep track of moves made for strategic purposes, but no formal scoring system is required beyond determining the winner.

### Examples

#### Example Game Play

**Start with Current Number = 60**

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Proper Divisors of 60**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1 Chooses**: 15
- **Current Number**: 60 - 15 = **45**

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Proper Divisors of 45**: 3, 5, 9, 15
- **Player 2 Chooses**: 15
- **Current Number**: 45 - 15 = **30**

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Proper Divisors of 30**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 1 Chooses**: 15
- **Current Number**: 30 - 15 = **15**

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Proper Divisors of 15**: 3, 5
- **Player 2 Chooses**: 5
- **Current Number**: 15 - 5 = **10**

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Proper Divisors of 10**: 2, 5
- **Player 1 Chooses**: 2
- **Current Number**: 10 - 2 = **8**

---

**Turn 6: Player 2**

- **Proper Divisors of 8**: 2, 4
- **Player 2 Chooses**: 4
- **Current Number**: 8 - 4 = **4**

---

**Turn 7: Player 1**

- **Proper Divisors of 4**: 2
- **Player 1 Chooses**: 2
- **Current Number**: 4 - 2 = **2**

---

**Turn 8: Player 2**

- **Proper Divisors of 2**: _None_ (since 2 is a prime number)
- **Player 2 Cannot Move**: No valid moves available.
- **Player 1 Wins**: Player 1 is declared the winner.

Choose a divisor to subtract: 15
New Current Number: 30

Player 1's Turn
Proper Divisors of 30: 2 3 5 6 10 15
Choose a divisor to subtract: 15
New Current Number: 15

Player 2's Turn
Proper Divisors of 15: 3 5
Choose a divisor to subtract: 5
New Current Number: 10

Player 1's Turn
Proper Divisors of 10: 2 5
Choose a divisor to subtract: 2
New Current Number: 8

Player 2's Turn
Proper Divisors of 8: 2 4
Choose a divisor to subtract: 4
New Current Number: 4

Player 1's Turn
Proper Divisors of 4: 2
Choose a divisor to subtract: 2
New Current Number: 2

Player 2's Turn
Proper Divisors of 2: None
No valid moves available. Player 2 loses.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

### Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of your move on the subsequent options available to your opponent. Try to leave them with numbers that have limited proper divisors.

- **Prime Awareness**: Forcing the current number to a prime number on your opponent's turn can guarantee a win, as they will have no valid moves.

- **Divisor Selection**: Choosing larger divisors may accelerate the game but consider how it affects future moves. Sometimes choosing a smaller divisor can be strategically advantageous.

- **Control the Game Flow**: Aim to control the progression of the current number to navigate towards a winning position.

---

### Ensuring Fair Play

- **Valid Divisors Only**: Always verify that the chosen divisor is a proper divisor of the current number.

- **Accurate Calculations**: Carefully perform subtraction and update the current number correctly.

- **Open Communication**: Both players should agree on the list of proper divisors each turn to prevent misunderstandings.
