In the game environment, the action space indices map to moves as follows:

- Index `0`: Represents the "defend" action, allowing the player to activate defense.
- Indices `1` to `10`: Correspond to attack actions with attack values from `1` to `10` respectively, allowing the player to attack the opponent with the chosen attack value.
