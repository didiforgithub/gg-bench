# Divisor Duel

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to **1** through division by its proper divisors. The player who achieves this objective wins the game. Conversely, a player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer called the **Current Number**. By default, this number is **60**, but players can agree on any positive integer greater than **1**.

2. **Players**: Two players participate in the game. Decide randomly or mutually agree on who takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared positive integer that is modified during the game.
- **Proper Divisors**: All positive integers that divide the **Current Number** exactly, excluding **1** and the **Current Number** itself.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: The player identifies all proper divisors of the **Current Number**.
  2. **Choose Divisor**: The player selects one proper divisor.
  3. **Divide**: The player divides the **Current Number** by the chosen proper divisor.
  4. **Update Current Number**: The result becomes the new **Current Number**.
  5. **Pass Turn**: The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Dividing the Current Number

- **Valid Move**: On your turn, you must divide the **Current Number** by one of its proper divisors.
  - **Proper Divisors** exclude **1** and the **Current Number** itself.
  - The division must result in an integer with no remainder.
- **Updating**: The quotient becomes the new **Current Number** for the next turn.

### 2. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: If you reduce the **Current Number** to exactly **1** on your turn, you win the game.

### 3. Losing the Game

- **No Valid Moves**: If the **Current Number** is a prime number greater than **1** on your turn, you have no valid proper divisors to choose from.
  - **Result**: You lose the game because you cannot make a move.

### 4. Forbidden Moves

- **Invalid Divisors**: You cannot choose **1** or the **Current Number** itself as the divisor.
- **Non-Divisors**: You cannot divide by a number that does not divide the **Current Number** exactly.

### 5. Additional Guidelines

- **Strategic Play**: Use foresight to leave your opponent with a **Current Number** that is a prime number greater than **1**, forcing them into a position with no valid moves.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game does not involve a point system. The outcome is either a win or a loss.
  - **Winner**: The player who reduces the **Current Number** to **1**.
  - **Loser**: The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Game Start

- **Current Number**: 60
- **Players**: Player 1 and Player 2

#### Turn Sequence

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Number**: 60
   - **Proper Divisors** of 60: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
   - **Action**: Player 1 chooses divisor **10**.
   - **Calculation**: 60 รท 10 = **6**
   - **New Current Number**: 6

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current Number**: 6
   - **Proper Divisors** of 6: 2, 3
   - **Action**: Player 2 chooses divisor **2**.
   - **Calculation**: 6 รท 2 = **3**
   - **New Current Number**: 3

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Number**: 3
   - **Proper Divisors** of 3: None (since 3 is prime)
   - **Outcome**: Player 1 cannot make a move and loses the game.

#### Game Result

- **Winner**: Player 2
- **Loser**: Player 1

### Command-Line Interaction Example

#### Assuming Players Alice and Bob

1. **Game Start**
   ```
   Starting Number: 60
   ```
2. **Alice's Turn**
   ```
   Current Number: 60
   Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
   Alice chooses to divide by 6.
   Calculation: 60 รท 6 = 10
   New Current Number: 10
   ```
3. **Bob's Turn**
   ```
   Current Number: 10
   Proper Divisors: 2, 5
   Bob chooses to divide by 2.
   Calculation: 10 รท 2 = 5
   New Current Number: 5
   ```
4. **Alice's Turn**
   ```
   Current Number: 5
   Proper Divisors: None (since 5 is prime)
   Alice cannot make a move.
   ```
5. **Game Over**
   ```
   Bob wins the game!
   ```

## Strategy Tips

- **Aim for Primes**: Try to leave the **Current Number** as a prime greater than **1** on your opponent's turn.
- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the possible divisors and resulting numbers two or more moves ahead.
- **Divisor Choice**: Opt for divisors that reduce the number to a value with limited proper divisors.

## Conclusion

**Divisor Duel** offers a quick and engaging experience that combines simple arithmetic with strategic planning. Its straightforward mechanics make it easy to code and play in a command-line interface. The game provides depth and complexity, allowing skilled players to consistently outmaneuver less experienced opponents. Enjoy honing your strategic thinking with this unique numerical challenge!
