In the game, the action space is a discrete space of size 9, representing the numbers 1 through 9. The action index corresponds directly to these numbers by adding 1 to the index. Specifically, the action indices 0 to 8 map to the numbers 1 to 9, respectively. For example, an action with index 0 selects the number 1, an index of 1 selects the number 2, and so on, up to an index of 8 selecting the number 9. Once a number is selected, it is marked as unavailable in further turns.
