In the CustomEnv gym environment, each action is represented by an integer from the `action_space`, which is determined by the formula `position * 2 + (remove_length - 1)`. Here, `position` is the starting index of the letter(s) to be removed, and `remove_length` is either 1 or 2, indicating whether one or two consecutive letters are removed. The action space indices are calculated as follows:
- `position * 2`: maps to the removal of one letter at the specified position.
- `position * 2 + 1`: maps to the removal of two consecutive letters starting at the specified position. 

Therefore, each position in the word has two possible actions: one for removing a single letter, and one for removing two adjacent letters, if allowed by the current state of the word.
