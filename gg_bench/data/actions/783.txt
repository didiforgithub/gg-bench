The action space indices in the game map directly to positions on the 5x5 grid, treated as a single-line list with indices ranging from 0 to 24. Each action index corresponds to a grid cell:

- The index `n` (from 0 to 24) maps to grid coordinates as follows:
  - Row: `n // 5` (integer division by 5, giving a range of 0 to 4 for row numbers)
  - Column: `n % 5` (remainder when divided by 5, giving a range of 0 to 4 for column numbers)

This mapping systematically covers all grid positions, allowing players to place their symbol ('X' or 'O') on any unoccupied cell by selecting the appropriate action index.
