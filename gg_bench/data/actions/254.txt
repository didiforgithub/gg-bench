In the game environment, the action space is represented by two discrete actions:

- **Action 0:** Maps to the "Add 1" move, which increases the current number by 1.
- **Action 1:** Maps to the "Multiply by 2" move, which doubles the current number.

These mappings allow the environment to interpret the player's chosen moves as numerical actions.
