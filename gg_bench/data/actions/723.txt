In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 34) correspond to game moves as follows:

- **Indices 0 to 8**: Questions "Is your number greater than X?" where X ranges from 1 to 9 (e.g., index 0 is "greater than 1", index 8 is "greater than 9").
- **Indices 9 to 17**: Questions "Is your number less than X?" where X ranges from 2 to 10 (e.g., index 9 is "less than 2", index 17 is "less than 10").
- **Indices 18 to 21**: Questions "Is your number divisible by X?" where X ranges from 2 to 5 (e.g., index 18 is "divisible by 2", index 21 is "divisible by 5").
- **Index 22**: Question "Is your number even?"
- **Index 23**: Question "Is your number odd?"
- **Index 24**: Question "Is your number a prime number?"
- **Indices 25 to 34**: Guesses for opponent's number, where index 25 corresponds to guessing "1", index 26 to "2", ..., up to index 34 for "10".
