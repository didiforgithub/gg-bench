**Divisor Duel**

---

**Objective:**

The objective of **Divisor Duel** is to avoid being the player who creates a cumulative sequence of digits that forms a number divisible by a predetermined target divisor. Players take turns adding single digits to the end of a shared sequence, aiming to force their opponent into making a move that results in divisibility by the target number, thus securing their own victory.

---

**Setup:**

1. **Determine Target Divisor:**
   - Before starting the game, both players agree upon a positive integer greater than 1 to serve as the **target divisor** (e.g., 7).

2. **Initialize the Sequence:**
   - The game begins with an **empty sequence**. No digits are on the board at the start.

3. **Decide Turn Order:**
   - Players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement). Turns will alternate between Player 1 and Player 2 thereafter.

---

**Game Components:**

- **Target Divisor:**
  - A positive integer greater than 1, chosen and agreed upon by both players before the game commences.

- **Shared Sequence:**
  - A cumulative sequence of digits that both players contribute to during their turns. It starts empty and grows as the game progresses.

- **Digits (0-9):**
  - On each turn, players select a **single digit** from 0 to 9 to add to the sequence.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - **Digit Selection:** On their turn, a player selects any single digit between 0 and 9.
   - **Sequence Update:** The selected digit is appended to the end of the shared sequence, forming a new number.
   - **Divisibility Check:** After updating the sequence, the player checks if the new number is divisible by the target divisor.

2. **Progression:**
   - Players alternate turns, following the above structure, until the game concludes.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Digit Selection:**
   - Players may choose **any single digit** from 0 to 9 on their turn.
   - Digits can be repeated; there are no restrictions on using digits multiple times in the sequence.

2. **Sequence Formation:**
   - The sequence is built by appending digits to the right end.
   - Example: If the current sequence is `123`, and the next player adds `4`, the new sequence becomes `1234`.

3. **Divisibility Check:**
   - After each turn, check if the current sequence number is divisible by the target divisor:
     - **If the number is not divisible**, the game continues.
     - **If the number is divisible**, the player who made that move **loses**, and the other player **wins**.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game ends when a player creates a sequence divisible by the target divisor.
   - The **winner** is the player who did **not** cause the sequence to be divisible by the target divisor.
   - There are **no ties or draws** in this game.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Game Outcome:**
  - The player who causes the sequence to be divisible by the target divisor **loses** the game.
  - The opposing player **wins** the game.

- **Match Play (Optional):**
  - Players can play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.
  - No points are awarded beyond tracking wins and losses.

**Examples:**

*Example 1:*

- **Target Divisor:** 7

- **Turn 1 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `1`.
  - **Sequence:** `1`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `1 % 7 = 1` (Not divisible)
  
- **Turn 2 (Player 2):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `2`.
  - **Sequence:** `12`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `12 % 7 = 5` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 3 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `3`.
  - **Sequence:** `123`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `123 % 7 = 4` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 4 (Player 2):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `4`.
  - **Sequence:** `1234`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `1234 % 7 = 5` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 5 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `5`.
  - **Sequence:** `12345`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `12345 % 7 = 4` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 6 (Player 2):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `6`.
  - **Sequence:** `123456`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `123456 % 7 = 5` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 7 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `7`.
  - **Sequence:** `1234567`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `1234567 % 7 = 0` (Divisible)
  - **Result:** Player 1 **loses**, Player 2 **wins**.

*Example 2:*

- **Target Divisor:** 5

- **Turn 1 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `2`.
  - **Sequence:** `2`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `2 % 5 = 2` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 2 (Player 2):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `3`.
  - **Sequence:** `23`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `23 % 5 = 3` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 3 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `4`.
  - **Sequence:** `234`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `234 % 5 = 4` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 4 (Player 2):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `1`.
  - **Sequence:** `2341`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `2341 % 5 = 1` (Not divisible)

- **Turn 5 (Player 1):**
  - **Action:** Adds digit `5`.
  - **Sequence:** `23415`
  - **Divisibility Check:** `23415 % 5 = 0` (Divisible)
  - **Result:** Player 1 **loses**, Player 2 **wins**.

**Strategic Tips:**

- **Understand Modulo Operations:**
  - Familiarity with modular arithmetic helps in predicting how adding certain digits will affect divisibility.

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the impact of your digit choices on future moves, aiming to leave your opponent with fewer safe options.

- **Manipulate the Sequence:**
  - Use digits that push the cumulative sequence towards numbers that are non-divisible on your turns but may become divisible on your opponent's turn.

**Sample Command-Line Interaction:**

*(Assuming Target Divisor is 7)*

```
Game Start! Target Divisor is 7.
Current Sequence: 

Player 1's Turn:
Enter a digit (0-9): 1
Current Sequence: 1
1 is not divisible by 7.
---

Player 2's Turn:
Enter a digit (0-9): 2
Current Sequence: 12
12 is not divisible by 7.
---

Player 1's Turn:
Enter a digit (0-9): 3
Current Sequence: 123
123 is not divisible by 7.
---

Player 2's Turn:
Enter a digit (0-9): 4
Current Sequence: 1234
1234 is not divisible by 7.
---

Player 1's Turn:
Enter a digit (0-9): 7
Current Sequence: 12347
12347 is divisible by 7!
Player 1 loses. Player 2 wins!
```

**Conclusion:**

Divisor Duel is a simple yet strategic game that tests numerical understanding and foresight. Easy to play in a command-line interface, it provides depth through mathematical strategy and forward-thinking. Players must carefully choose their moves to avoid creating a sequence divisible by the target number while setting traps for their opponent.

Enjoy the challenge and may the most strategic player win!
