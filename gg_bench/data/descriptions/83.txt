# Nonprime Addition: Rule Book

## Objective

**Be the first to force your opponent to reach a prime total.**

In **Nonprime Addition**, two players take turns adding numbers to a running total. The goal is to strategically select numbers so that your opponent is compelled to bring the total to a prime number. The player who causes the total to be a prime number on their turn loses the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Total**: The game begins with a total of **1**.
2. **Number Pool**: Players can add any whole number between **2** and **9** inclusive on their turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Running Total**: A single integer value that keeps track of the cumulative sum of the numbers added by the players.
- **Numbers Available for Addition**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive.
  - These numbers are **unlimited** in quantity and can be used multiple times throughout the game.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).
2. **Player Actions During Their Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: Choose any number between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - **Add to Total**: Add the chosen number to the running total.
   - **Check for Primality**: After adding, check if the new total is a prime number.
     - **If the total is a prime number**, the player who just played **loses**.
     - **If the total is not a prime number**, the game continues.
3. **Progression of Turns**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On each turn, a player may choose **any** number between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - Numbers can be reused; there is no limit to how many times a number can be selected during the game.

2. **Adding to the Total**:
   - The chosen number is **added** to the running total.
   - The new total becomes the current total for the next player.

3. **Prime Number Loss Condition**:
   - If a player's move results in the running total being a **prime number**, that player **loses** immediately.
   - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

4. **Nonprime Continuation**:
   - If the new total is **not** a prime number, play passes to the opponent.

5. **Valid Numbers**:
   - Only **whole numbers** between **2** and **9** can be selected.
   - **1** is excluded to prevent immediate loss conditions and to enhance strategic complexity.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player loses by making the total prime.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: Forcing your opponent to add a number that results in a prime total, or maneuvering such that any number they add would result in a prime total on their next turn.
- **Tracking the Total**: Keep a clear record of the running total after each turn.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Setup**:
- Running Total: **1**

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1** selects **5**.
- Adds **5** to total: **1 + 5 = 6**.
- New Total: **6** (Not prime)
- **Game continues**.

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 2** selects **4**.
- Adds **4** to total: **6 + 4 = 10**.
- New Total: **10** (Not prime)
- **Game continues**.

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1** selects **3**.
- Adds **3** to total: **10 + 3 = 13**.
- New Total: **13**
- **13 is a prime number**.
- **Player 1 loses**, **Player 2 wins**.

---

### Strategic Consideration

- **Avoiding Prime Totals**: Players must calculate and anticipate whether their chosen number will result in a prime total.
- **Forcing the Opponent's Hand**: Players may set up the total in such a way that the opponent has no options but to result in a prime total on their turn.

## Sample Command-Line Interaction

Assuming players input their chosen number when prompted.

```plaintext
Starting Nonprime Addition Game!
Running Total: 1

Player 1's turn.
Choose a number to add (2-9): 5
New Total: 6
6 is not prime.
Game continues...

Player 2's turn.
Choose a number to add (2-9): 4
New Total: 10
10 is not prime.
Game continues...

Player 1's turn.
Choose a number to add (2-9): 3
New Total: 13
13 is prime!
Player 1 loses.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Additional Rules Clarification

- **Prime Numbers**:
  - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
  - Common primes to watch out for in this game (within typical totals): 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc.

- **Invalid Inputs**:
  - If a player selects a number outside the valid range (2-9), they should be prompted again.
  - Consistent invalid inputs may result in forfeiture.

- **Mathematical Assistance**:
  - Players may use paper or mental math to calculate upcoming totals and assess primality.
  - Calculators are allowed if both players agree.

## Strategies for Skilled Play

1. **Primality Awareness**:
   - Keep a mental list of prime numbers and near-prime numbers within the possible total range.

2. **Backward Calculation**:
   - Anticipate future totals by considering the possible moves your opponent can make in response to your move.

3. **Forced Moves**:
   - Aim to set the total such that any number the opponent adds will result in a prime number.

4. **Safe Numbers**:
   - Identify 'safe' numbers to add that won't lead to immediate loss or set up the opponent for an easy win.

## Conclusion

**Nonprime Addition** is a simple yet strategically rich game that challenges players to think ahead and apply basic arithmetic and number theory concepts. By carefully selecting numbers and anticipating your opponent's options, you can steer the game towards a victory.

Enjoy the challenge of avoiding primes and may the most strategic player win!
