In the game, each action space index corresponds to a move number that can be selected by a player on their turn. The mapping is as follows:

- Action index \(0\) maps to move number \(1\).
- Action index \(1\) maps to move number \(2\).
- Action index \(2\) maps to move number \(3\).
- Action index \(3\) maps to move number \(4\).
- Action index \(4\) maps to move number \(5\).
- Action index \(5\) maps to move number \(6\).
- Action index \(6\) maps to move number \(7\).
- Action index \(7\) maps to move number \(8\).
- Action index \(8\) maps to move number \(9\).

Here, action indices (0-8) are direct mappings to move numbers (1-9), incrementing each index by one to get the move number.
