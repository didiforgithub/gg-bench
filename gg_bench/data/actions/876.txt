In the gym environment for Number Duel, the action space is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 9. Each index corresponds to an attack number from 1 to 10 in the game, where the index `i` translates to the attack number `i + 1`. For example, an action space index of 0 maps to the attack number 1, index 1 maps to attack number 2, and so on up to index 9, which maps to attack number 10.
