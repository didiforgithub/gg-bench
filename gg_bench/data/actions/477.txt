In the provided gym environment for the game "Dual Digits," the action space is defined as a discrete space with 4 indices (0-3). Each index corresponds to one of the valid subtraction numbers in the game as follows:

- Index 0 maps to subtracting the number 1.
- Index 1 maps to subtracting the number 2.
- Index 2 maps to subtracting the number 3.
- Index 3 maps to subtracting the number 4.

This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the chosen index to derive the actual number to subtract from the shared number during the player's turn.
