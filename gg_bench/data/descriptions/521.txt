# Zero Sum Duel

## Objective

The objective of **Zero Sum Duel** is to be the first player to have a hand of cards that sums exactly to zero. Players strategically draw and discard numbered cards, aiming to balance positive and negative values in their hand. The player who achieves a total hand value of zero wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Deck Preparation**: Create a deck of cards numbered from **-5** to **+5**, excluding zero. There should be one card for each number, resulting in a total of **10** cards.
2. **Shuffle**: Shuffle the deck thoroughly to randomize the order of the cards.
3. **No Initial Hands**: Both players start with an empty hand.
4. **Starting Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Deck of Numbered Cards**: Cards numbered from **-5** to **+5** (excluding zero), making **10** cards in total.
  - **Card Values**: Each card represents an integer value, either positive or negative.
- **Player Hands**: Each player can hold up to a maximum of **3** cards in their hand.
- **Discard Pile**: A place to put discarded cards face up.

## Turns

The game progresses in alternating turns between the two players. Each turn consists of the following steps:

1. **Draw Phase**: The active player draws the top card from the deck.
2. **Hand Limit Check**: If the player's hand now contains more than **3** cards, they must proceed to the Discard Phase.
3. **Discard Phase** (if needed):
   - The player must choose one card from their hand to discard into the discard pile.
4. **Hand Evaluation**: The player checks if the sum of the cards in their hand equals zero.
   - **Win Condition**: If the sum is zero, the player declares it and wins the game.
5. **Turn End**: If the sum is not zero, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Drawing Cards**:
  - Players must draw one card from the deck at the beginning of their turn.
  - If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
- **Hand Limit**:
  - A player's hand cannot contain more than **3** cards at any time.
  - If drawing a card causes the hand to exceed **3** cards, the player must discard one card during the Discard Phase.
- **Discarding Cards**:
  - Players may only discard during their own turn and only when their hand exceeds **3** cards.
  - Discarded cards are placed face up in the discard pile.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins immediately when the sum of the cards in their hand equals zero.
  - The sum must be exactly zero; no other total results in a win.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game continues until a player wins; there are no draw conditions.
- **Strategy Elements**:
  - Players must decide which cards to keep and which to discard to achieve a zero total.
  - Tracking which cards have been played can provide an advantage.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The first player to achieve a hand sum of zero wins the game.
- There are no points or secondary scoring methods; the game is won outright.

## Additional Rules for Strategic Depth

- **Observing Discards**: Since discarded cards are visible, players can infer which cards remain in the deck.
- **Bluffing**: Players might keep high positive or negative cards to mislead the opponent.
- **Deck Cycling**: If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck, adding a layer of strategy regarding which cards might come up again.

## Implementation Notes for Command-Line Interface

- **Card Representation**: Use simple strings like "+3", "-2" to represent cards.
- **Input Prompts**: Clearly prompt players when they need to make decisions (e.g., choosing a card to discard).
- **Game State Display**: Show players their hand and hand sum at each turn.
- **Validation**: Ensure inputs for discarding are valid (e.g., the card exists in their hand).

## Conclusion

**Zero Sum Duel** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to balance their hand to achieve a total sum of zero. With straightforward rules and minimal components, it is easy to code and play within a command-line interface. The game offers depth through strategic discarding and the ability to track which cards have been played, allowing skilled players to gain an advantage over unskilled opponents.
