In the given gym environment for the game Prime Connection, the action space is represented by discrete indices ranging from 0 to 49. Each index corresponds directly to a number within the game’s number pool, specifically indexes 0 through 49 representing numbers 1 through 50, respectively. Therefore, when an agent chooses an action, it effectively selects the number that the index represents, which dictates the player’s move. This mapping ensures that the action space directly aligns with the available choices in the game, where choosing an action index translates to selecting the corresponding number from the number pool.
