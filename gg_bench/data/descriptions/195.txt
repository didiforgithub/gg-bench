# Number Clash: Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Clash** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players aim to accumulate the highest total score over five rounds. Each player uses a set of unique numbers to outwit their opponent. The primary goal is to strategically select and reveal numbers to win rounds and gain points. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.

---

## Setup

1. **Player Preparation**: Each player is assigned a unique set of numbers from **1** to **5**.
2. **Rounds**: The game consists of **five rounds**.
3. **Starting Conditions**: All numbers are initially unused and available to each player.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Cards**: Represented by numbers **1** through **5** for each player.
  - *Appearance*: Since this is a command-line game, numbers are displayed as plain digits.
  - *Functionality*: Each number can be used once per game to contest a round.
  - *Unique Attributes*: Higher numbers have a greater chance of winning a round but may be strategically saved for later.

---

## Turns

- **Simultaneous Play**: In each round, both players select their numbers simultaneously.
- **Order of Actions**:
  1. **Selection Phase**: Both players secretly choose one unused number from their set.
  2. **Reveal Phase**: Players simultaneously reveal their chosen numbers.
  3. **Resolution Phase**: The round winner is determined, scores are calculated, and used numbers are discarded.
- **Progression**: This process repeats for all five rounds.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players must select an unused number from their set in each round.
   - Once a number is used, it cannot be selected again.

2. **Revealing Numbers**:
   - After selection, both players reveal their numbers at the same time.

3. **Determining Round Winner**:
   - The player who reveals the **higher number** wins the round.
   - If both players reveal the **same number**, the round is a tie, and no points are awarded.

4. **Scoring**:
   - The round winner gains points equal to the **difference** between the two numbers.
     - Example: If Player A plays **5** and Player B plays **3**, Player A gains **2 points** (5 - 3 = 2).
   - In the event of a tie, neither player gains points.

5. **End of Round**:
   - Used numbers are discarded and unavailable for future rounds.
   - Proceed to the next round until all five rounds are completed.

6. **Winning the Game**:
   - After five rounds, each player's total score is calculated by summing their points from each round.
   - **Victory Conditions**:
     - The player with the **higher total score** wins the game.
     - **Tiebreakers**:
       - If total scores are equal, the player who **won more rounds** is the winner.
       - If still tied, the player who **won the last round** wins the game.
