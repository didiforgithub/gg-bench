The action space indices in the game map directly to the cells on the 5x5 grid, plus an additional index for a pass action. The indices 0 to 24 correspond to the 25 cells in a row-major order: starting from the top-left cell A1 as index 0 and going left to right, top to bottom, ending at the bottom-right cell E5 as index 24. The index 25 is reserved for the action to pass when no valid moves are available.
