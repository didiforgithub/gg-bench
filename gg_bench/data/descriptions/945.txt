# Zero Sum Duel

## Rule Book

### Objective

Zero Sum Duel is a two-player turn-based game where the goal is to be the first player to reduce your total score to exactly zero. Players strategically subtract numbers from their own scores, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent while adhering to the game's simple rules.

### Setup

- **Initial Scores**: Both players start with a total score of **20**.
- **Allowed Numbers**: The numbers **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and **5** are available for subtraction.

### Game Components

#### Player Scores

- **Player 1 Score**: Begins at **20**.
- **Player 2 Score**: Begins at **20**.

#### Subtraction Numbers

- A set of integers from **1** to **5**.
- These numbers represent the values players can subtract from their scores on their turn.

### Turns

- Players decide who goes first through mutual agreement or by a random method (e.g., coin toss).
- Players alternate turns throughout the game.

#### Structure of a Turn

1. **Choose a Number**: The player selects a number between **1** and **5** to subtract from their total score.
2. **Apply Restriction**: The chosen number **cannot** be the same as the number subtracted by the opponent on their **immediately preceding turn**.
3. **Subtract the Number**: The chosen number is subtracted from the player's total score.
4. **Check for Validity**: If subtracting the chosen number would reduce the score below zero, the player must choose a different number.
5. **End Turn**: The turn ends, and it becomes the opponent's turn.

### Rules and Mechanics

#### Core Rules

- **Allowed Subtractions**: Only numbers **1** through **5** can be subtracted.
- **Immediate Restriction**: A player cannot subtract the same number their opponent just subtracted on the previous turn.
- **Score Limit**: A player's score cannot drop below zero. Moves resulting in a negative score are invalid.
- **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach a score of **exactly zero** wins the game.
- **No Draws**: The game continues until one player wins; there are no draws.

#### Special Conditions

- **No Valid Moves**: If a player has no valid numbers to subtract (all would reduce the score below zero or are restricted), that player loses the game.

### Scoring

- **Score Tracking**: Keep a running total of each player's score after every turn.
- **Victory Condition**: The player who reduces their score to exactly zero first is declared the winner.
