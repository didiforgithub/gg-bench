In the given "Prime Duel" game environment, the action space indices directly map to the list of prime numbers less than 50. Each index in the action space corresponds to a specific prime number from the predefined list, allowing a player to select that prime as their move. For example, an action space index of 0 selects the prime number 2, an index of 1 selects 3, index 2 selects 5, and so on up to index 14 which selects 47. This mapping enables the player to choose a prime number from the pool to attack the opponent, with the chosen index indicating the specific prime to be used in that turn.
