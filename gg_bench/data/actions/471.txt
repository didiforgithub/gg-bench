In the gym environment for Sequence Duel, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing the numbers 1 to 9. Each action corresponds to selecting a number from the available numbers, where an index `i` in the action space represents choosing the number `i + 1`. For example, action index `0` maps to the number `1`, action index `1` maps to the number `2`, and so on, up to action index `8` which maps to the number `9`. This mapping aligns with the requirement that each number can only be used once per game, as marked by the available numbers list.
