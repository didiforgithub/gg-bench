# Factor Duel

## Objective

The objective of **Factor Duel** is to be the first player to reduce the current number to a prime number, thereby forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Victory is achieved by strategic subtraction of proper divisors, ultimately leaving your opponent without options.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Decide on an initial positive integer greater than 2 to start the game. By default, the game begins with **100**, but players can agree on any suitable starting number.

2. **Player Order**: Determine who will take the first turn. This can be decided by mutual agreement or by a simple method such as a coin toss.

3. **Game Readiness**: No physical materials are required. Ensure both players have means to calculate or reference the proper divisors of numbers (mental calculation, paper, or a simple program).

## Game Components

- **Initial Number (`N`)**: The starting number from which players will subtract proper divisors.

- **Proper Divisors**: Positive integers less than `N` that divide `N` evenly (excluding `N` itself).

- **Current Number**: The result after each turn, which becomes the new number for the subsequent turn.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.

- **On Each Turn**:
  - The active player must subtract a proper divisor of the current number.
  - The subtraction result becomes the new current number for the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Subtracting Proper Divisors**:

   - A proper divisor is any positive integer less than the current number that divides it evenly (without leaving a remainder).
   
   - **Example**: Proper divisors of `8` are `1`, `2`, and `4`.

2. **Valid Moves**:

   - On their turn, a player must choose one proper divisor to subtract from the current number.
   
   - The chosen divisor must be subtracted; adding or performing other operations is not allowed.

3. **Updating the Current Number**:

   - After subtraction, the result becomes the new current number.
   
   - This new number is used by the next player on their turn.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - **Primary Victory Condition**: If a player reduces the current number to a prime number on their turn, they **win the game immediately**.
   
   - **Prime Numbers**: Numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

5. **Losing the Game**:

   - If a player starts their turn and the current number is prime (greater than `2`), they **lose the game** because they cannot make a valid move (primes have no proper divisors other than `1`, and subtracting `1` would not produce a prime number).

6. **Special Case - Number `1`**:

   - If the current number is reduced to `1`, the player whose move resulted in `1` loses, as `1` has no proper divisors other than itself.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game is based on a win-or-lose outcome with no point system.
  
- **Winning**: Achieved by making strategic moves that leave the opponent without valid options, specifically by reducing the current number to a prime on your turn.
  
- **Losing**: Occurs when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn due to the current number being prime or `1`.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Starting Number**: 100

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `100`: `1`, `2`, `4`, `5`, `10`, `20`, `25`, `50`
   - Player 1 subtracts `25`: `100 - 25 = 75`
   
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `75`: `1`, `3`, `5`, `15`, `25`
   - Player 2 subtracts `25`: `75 - 25 = 50`
   
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `50`: `1`, `2`, `5`, `10`, `25`
   - Player 1 subtracts `25`: `50 - 25 = 25`
   
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `25`: `1`, `5`
   - Player 2 subtracts `5`: `25 - 5 = 20`
   
5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `20`: `1`, `2`, `4`, `5`, `10`
   - Player 1 subtracts `10`: `20 - 10 = 10`
   
6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `10`: `1`, `2`, `5`
   - Player 2 subtracts `5`: `10 - 5 = 5`
   
7. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current number is `5`, a prime number
   - **Result**: Player 1 wins by reducing the number to a prime on their turn

### Example 2

**Starting Number**: 30

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `30`: `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `10`, `15`
   - Player 1 subtracts `15`: `30 - 15 = 15`
   
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `15`: `1`, `3`, `5`
   - Player 2 subtracts `5`: `15 - 5 = 10`
   
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Proper divisors of `10`: `1`, `2`, `5`
   - Player 1 subtracts `5`: `10 - 5 = 5`
   
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current number is `5`, a prime number
   - **Result**: Player 2 loses because they cannot make a valid move on a prime number

## Strategy Tips

- **Avoid Prime Numbers on Your Turn**: Do not reduce the current number to a prime on your own turn unless it ensures your victory.

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the proper divisors of the resulting numbers to anticipate your opponent's options.

- **Manipulate the Current Number**: Aim to leave numbers for your opponent that have limited proper divisors, increasing the chances they will have to face a prime number on their turn.

- **Balance Divisor Size**: Sometimes subtracting smaller divisors prolongs the game, allowing you more control, while larger divisors can force the game into a quicker conclusion.
