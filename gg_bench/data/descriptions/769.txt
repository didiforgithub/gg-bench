# Number Spiral

## Objective

**Number Spiral** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal of the game is to force your opponent to reach or exceed the target number of **1,000**. Players take turns multiplying a running total by a chosen number, strategically aiming to avoid being the one to push the total to or beyond the limit. The player who causes the total to reach or exceed **1,000** loses the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a running total of **1**.
2. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
3. **Available Multipliers**: Both players have access to the same set of multipliers, which are the integers from **2** to **9**, inclusive.

## Game Components

- **Running Total**: A cumulative number that starts at **1** and is updated each turn based on player actions.
- **Multipliers**: Numbers from **2** to **9** that players choose from on their turn to multiply the running total.
- **Target Number**: The number **1,000** is the threshold that players must avoid reaching or exceeding.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Player Actions**: On their turn, a player must:
  1. **Choose a Multiplier**: Select an integer between **2** and **9**.
  2. **Multiply the Running Total**: Multiply the current running total by the chosen multiplier.
  3. **Update the Running Total**: Announce the new running total to the opponent.
- **Turn Progression**: The updated running total becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing Multipliers**:
   - Players must choose a multiplier between **2** and **9**, inclusive.
   - Any multiplier can be reused; there are no restrictions on selecting previously used numbers.

2. **Updating the Running Total**:
   - Multiply the current running total by your chosen multiplier.
   - The result becomes the new running total for the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player's action causes the running total to reach or exceed **1,000**, that player **loses** the game.
   - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Players cannot pass their turn; a multiplier must be chosen each turn.
   - If a player fails to choose a valid multiplier (e.g., a number outside of **2** to **9**), they must reselect within the valid range.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: The game does not use a point-based scoring system. Victory is achieved by forcing your opponent to reach or surpass the target number of **1,000**.
- **Match Play**: Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Starting the Game

- **Running Total**: 1
- **Player 1** and **Player 2** decide that **Player 1** will start.

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Multiplier Chosen**: 5
- **Calculation**: 1 × 5 = 5
- **Running Total**: 5
- **Announcement**: "I choose 5. The new total is 5."

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Multiplier Chosen**: 9
- **Calculation**: 5 × 9 = 45
- **Running Total**: 45
- **Announcement**: "I choose 9. The new total is 45."

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Multiplier Chosen**: 2
- **Calculation**: 45 × 2 = 90
- **Running Total**: 90
- **Announcement**: "I choose 2. The new total is 90."

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Multiplier Chosen**: 9
- **Calculation**: 90 × 9 = 810
- **Running Total**: 810
- **Announcement**: "I choose 9. The new total is 810."

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Possible Multipliers**: Choosing any multiplier will result in the running total reaching or exceeding 1,000.
  - 810 × 2 = 1,620
  - 810 × 3 = 2,430
  - ...
  - 810 × 9 = 7,290
- **Conclusion**: Player 1 cannot make a move without exceeding 1,000.
- **Result**: Player 1 multiplies 810 by 2 (smallest possible multiplier).
- **Announcement**: "I choose 2. The new total is 1,620. I have reached 1,000 or more."
- **Winner**: Player 2 wins the game.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Players should calculate potential future totals to avoid setting up the opponent for a winning move.
- **Control the Running Total**: Aim to keep the running total at a number that limits the opponent's options.
- **Multiplier Selection**: Choosing higher multipliers can force the game to end more quickly but may backfire if not timed correctly.

## Conclusion

**Number Spiral** is a game of multiplication and strategy, requiring players to think ahead and make calculated decisions to outmaneuver their opponent. With simple rules and quick gameplay, it provides an engaging challenge that tests numerical agility and strategic planning.
