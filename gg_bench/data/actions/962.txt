The action space in the gym environment is defined as `spaces.Discrete(5)`, representing the five positions a player can attack, indexed from 0 to 4. Each index in the action space corresponds to one of the opponent's positions as follows:

- **Index 0**: Attack opponent's position 1
- **Index 1**: Attack opponent's position 2
- **Index 2**: Attack opponent's position 3
- **Index 3**: Attack opponent's position 4
- **Index 4**: Attack opponent's position 5

This mapping allows each action index to translate directly to attacking a specific position in the game.
