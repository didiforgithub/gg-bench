The action space in the given gym environment for Number Nimble is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 8, which correspond to the numbers 1 to 9 in the game. Specifically, an action with index `i` represents selecting the number `(i + 1)` from the available numbers list. Therefore, if a player chooses action 0, it maps to selecting the number 1; action 1 corresponds to number 2, and so on until action 8, which corresponds to number 9. This mapping allows players to select numbers using zero-based indices in the array representing available numbers.
