The action space indices in the game are mapped to moves by dividing the indices into groups based on the possible number selections (`n`) and the arithmetic operations. The mapping is as follows:

- Indices 0-3 correspond to selecting `n = 1` with operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, respectively.
- Indices 4-7 correspond to selecting `n = 2` with operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, respectively.
- Indices 8-11 correspond to selecting `n = 3` with operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, respectively.
- Indices 12-15 correspond to selecting `n = 4` with operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, respectively.
- Indices 16-19 correspond to selecting `n = 5` with operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, respectively.
- Indices 20-23 correspond to selecting `n = 6` with operations `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, respectively.

Each group of four indices accounts for one integer `n` and all four possible operations, creating a total of 24 unique actions (6 numbers x 4 operations).
