# Prime Reduction

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce your current number to **1** by strategically subtracting its prime factors. The player who reduces their number to **1** first wins the game. There are no draws; every game results in a win or a loss.

---

## Setup

1. **Choose a Starting Number**: Both players agree on a positive integer as the starting number. For a quick game, select a number between **15** and **50** (e.g., **30**, **35**, **42**).

2. **Initialize Player Numbers**: Each player starts with the chosen starting number as their current number.

---

## Game Components

- **Starting Number (N)**: A positive integer agreed upon by both players at the beginning of the game.

- **Current Number**: The number each player updates on their turn by subtracting prime factors.

- **Prime Factors**: Prime numbers that divide the current number exactly without leaving a remainder.

- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their moves through text commands.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin). Players then alternate turns.

2. **Player Actions**: On your turn, you must:

   - Determine the prime factors of your current number.
   - Choose one of these prime factors.
   - Subtract the chosen prime factor from your current number.

3. **End of Turn**: After completing your move, it's the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Valid Moves

- **Subtracting Prime Factors**: You can only subtract a prime factor of your current number.

  - *Example*: If your current number is **28**, its prime factors are **2** and **7**. You may subtract **2** or **7**.

- **Positive Results Only**: The result after subtraction must be a positive integer greater than **0**.

### Prime Factors

- **Definition**: Prime factors are prime numbers that divide your current number exactly.

  - *Example*: The prime factors of **30** are **2**, **3**, and **5**.

- **Finding Prime Factors**: Factorize your current number to identify valid options for subtraction.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to reduce their current number exactly to **1** wins.

- **No Valid Moves**: If a player's current number is **1** at the start of their turn (and thus they cannot make a move), they lose the game.

### No Draws

- The game cannot end in a draw. Players will continue to reduce their numbers until one reaches **1**.

### Invalid Moves

- **Non-Prime Factors**: You cannot subtract numbers that are not prime factors of your current number.

- **Negative or Zero Results**: Moves resulting in zero or negative numbers are not allowed.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Reduce your current number to **1** before your opponent does.

- **Losing**: Fail to reduce your current number to **1** before your opponent.

- **No Point System**: The game is won by achieving the objective, not by accumulating points.

## Examples

### Example Game Starting with 30

**Initial Setup**:

- Player 1 Current Number: **30**
- Player 2 Current Number: **30**

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 30
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3, 5
- **Action**: Subtract 5
- **Calculation**: 30 - 5 = **25**
- **New Current Number**: 25

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 30
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3, 5
- **Action**: Subtract 3
- **Calculation**: 30 - 3 = **27**
- **New Current Number**: 27

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 25
- **Prime Factors**: 5
- **Action**: Subtract 5
- **Calculation**: 25 - 5 = **20**
- **New Current Number**: 20

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 27
- **Prime Factors**: 3
- **Action**: Subtract 3
- **Calculation**: 27 - 3 = **24**
- **New Current Number**: 24

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 20
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 5
- **Action**: Subtract 5
- **Calculation**: 20 - 5 = **15**
- **New Current Number**: 15

---

**Turn 6: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 24
- **Prime Factors**: 2, 3
- **Action**: Subtract 3
- **Calculation**: 24 - 3 = **21**
- **New Current Number**: 21

---

**...Game Continues...**

Players continue in this manner until one player reduces their current number to **1**.

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

**Player 1's Turn**:

```
Your current number is 30.
Prime factors: 2, 3, 5
Enter the prime factor to subtract: 5
You subtracted 5 from 30.
Your new current number is 25.
```

---

**Player 2's Turn**:

```
Your current number is 30.
Prime factors: 2, 3, 5
Enter the prime factor to subtract: 3
You subtracted 3 from 30.
Your new current number is 27.
```

---

**Player 1's Next Turn**:

```
Your current number is 25.
Prime factor: 5
Enter the prime factor to subtract: 5
You subtracted 5 from 25.
Your new current number is 20.
```

---

**Player 2's Next Turn**:

```
Your current number is 27.
Prime factor: 3
Enter the prime factor to subtract: 3
You subtracted 3 from 27.
Your new current number is 24.
```

---

*The game proceeds until one player wins.*

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future prime factors of resulting numbers to choose optimal moves.

- **Prime Knowledge**: Familiarity with prime numbers and factorization will give you an advantage.

- **Control the Game**: Try to force your opponent into positions with limited or disadvantageous moves.

---

## Summary

"Prime Reduction" is a strategic, numerical game where players use knowledge of prime numbers and factorization to outmaneuver their opponent. With simple rules and a clear objective, it's easy to learn and quick to play, yet offers depth for those who look to master it.
