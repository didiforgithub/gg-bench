In the provided gym environment for Factor Chain Duel, the action space indices map to the moves in the game as follows: each action index from 0 to 48 corresponds to selecting a number from 2 to 50, inclusive. Specifically, action index `i` maps to the number `i + 2`. When a player chooses an action, it means selecting the number that matches this index-to-number mapping. This is consistent with the game's available numbers, which range from 2 to 50.
