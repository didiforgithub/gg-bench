The action space indices (0 to 15) correspond to the positions on the 4x4 grid, where each index represents a cell in the grid, filled row-wise from top to bottom and left to right. Specifically, index 0 represents the top-left corner (row 1, column 1), index 1 represents the second cell in the first row (row 1, column 2), continuing across the row to index 3 (top-right corner, row 1, column 4). The pattern repeats for the subsequent rows with index 4 corresponding to row 2, column 1, and so on, up to index 15 for the bottom-right corner (row 4, column 4).
