In the game environment, the action space is represented by discrete indices corresponding to potential swap positions within the sequence. An index `i` in the action space maps to swapping the element at position `i` with the element at position `i+1` in the sequence. Given the sequence length of 5, the valid action indices range from 0 to 3, allowing each index to represent one of the four possible adjacent swaps (positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5).
