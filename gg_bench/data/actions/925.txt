In the gym environment code provided for the "Digit Chain Duel" game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(99)`, which means there are 99 possible actions, corresponding to indices 0 through 98. Each action index maps directly to selecting a number from the shared pool that ranges from 1 to 99. Specifically, action index `n` selects the number `n + 1` from the pool. For example, the action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 98 corresponds to selecting the number 99, and so on. This mapping ensures consistency between the 0-based indexing used in programming and the 1-based numbering in the game.
