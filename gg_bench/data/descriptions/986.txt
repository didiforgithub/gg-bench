# Factor Field

## Objective

Be the **first player** to accumulate **10 points** by selecting numbers with the highest number of **unique prime factors** from a common number pool.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization:**
   - The game uses all integers from **2 to 50**, inclusive.
   - All numbers are initially **available** for selection.

2. **Player Assignment:**
   - Two players are required: **Player A** and **Player B**.
   - Decide who will take the **first turn** (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

3. **Scoreboard:**
   - A simple scoreboard to keep track of each player's **cumulative points**.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool:**
  - A list of numbers from **2 to 50** that players can select from.
  - Numbers are **removed** from the pool once selected.

- **Scoreboard:**
  - Tracks each player's **current score** after every turn.
  - Displays the **remaining numbers** in the number pool.

- **Prime Factors:**
  - Knowledge of prime numbers and factorization is essential.
  - Understanding that factors are the prime numbers that multiply to give the selected number.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - The player who goes first is **Player A**, followed by **Player B**.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Select a Number:**
     - Choose any **available number** from the number pool.
   - **Calculate Points:**
     - Determine the **unique prime factors** of the selected number.
     - **Points Gained** = Number of unique prime factors.
   - **Update Scoreboard:**
     - Add the points gained to the player's **cumulative score**.
     - Remove the selected number from the number pool.
     - Display updated scores and remaining numbers.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - The turn ends after the player's score is updated.
   - The next player then takes their turn following the same process.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection

- Players can select **any number** from the number pool on their turn.
- Each number can be selected **only once** during the game.

### 2. Calculating Prime Factors

- **Prime Factors** are the prime numbers that multiply together to equal the selected number.
- **Multiplicity** (the number of times a prime factor appears) is **ignored**.
  - For example, the number **18** has prime factors **2 × 3 × 3**, but only **2** and **3** are counted as unique prime factors.
- Use prime factorization methods to determine the unique prime factors.

### 3. Scoring Points

- **Points Gained** per turn = Number of **unique prime factors** of the selected number.
- Points are **cumulative** over turns.
- Example Points for Sample Numbers:
  - **6** (factors: 2, 3) → **2 points**
  - **8** (factors: 2) → **1 point**
  - **30** (factors: 2, 3, 5) → **3 points**

### 4. Winning the Game

- The game continues until a player reaches **10 or more points** at the **end of their turn**.
- **Victory Conditions:**
  - If a player reaches 10 or more points and has a **higher score** than the opponent, they **win**.
  - If both players reach 10 or more points in the same round, the player with the **higher score** wins.
  - If scores are **tied** at 10 or more points, the game proceeds until the tie is broken.

### 5. Strategic Considerations

- **Maximize Points:**
  - Choose numbers with the **highest number of unique prime factors**.
- **Deny Opponent Opportunities:**
  - Anticipate which numbers the opponent might select and choose strategically to limit their options.
- **Number Awareness:**
  - Keep track of remaining numbers to plan future moves.

## Scoring

- **Scoreboard Updates:**
  - After each turn, the scoreboard displays:
    - **Player A's Score**
    - **Player B's Score**
    - **Numbers Remaining** in the pool
- **Points Tracking:**
  - Ensure accurate calculation of points by carefully determining the unique prime factors.
- **Winning Announcement:**
  - Once a player wins, announce the **winner** and display the **final scores**.
