The action space indices in the CustomEnv correspond to the numbers 1 through 9 that can be played in the game. Specifically, each index from 0 to 8 in the action space maps to a number by adding 1 to the index, meaning:

- Action index 0 corresponds to playing the number 1.
- Action index 1 corresponds to playing the number 2.
- Action index 2 corresponds to playing the number 3.
- ...
- Action index 8 corresponds to playing the number 9.

This mapping allows players to select numbers 1 through 9 based on the available options and the current game pattern.
