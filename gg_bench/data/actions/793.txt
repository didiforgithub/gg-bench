The action space indices map directly to the positions on the 4x4 game grid in a row-major order. Each index from 0 to 15 corresponds to a specific cell on the grid, where index 0 refers to the top-left cell (row 0, column 0), index 1 refers to the cell to its right (row 0, column 1), continuing in this manner across each row, and ending with index 15 for the bottom-right cell (row 3, column 3). Thus, selecting an action at index `i` indicates claiming the cell at position `(i // 4, i % 4)` on the grid.
