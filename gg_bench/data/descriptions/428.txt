# Odd and Even Challenge

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly 20 points** by strategically rolling a die and accumulating points. The game requires players to balance risk and reward, deciding whether to roll again for more points or pass to avoid overshooting the target score.

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players participate in the game.
2. **Starting Scores**: Both players begin with a score of **0**.
3. **Die**: A virtual six-sided die is used, generating numbers from 1 to 6.
4. **Turn Order**: Determine who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or agreement).

## Game Components

- **Virtual Die**: Simulated six-sided die that produces a random integer between 1 and 6.
- **Scoreboard**: Tracks each player's current score throughout the game.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- During a turn, a player can choose one of the following actions:
  - **Roll the Die**: Attempt to increase their score.
  - **Pass**: End their turn to secure their current score.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Rolling the Die

- **Action**: The player rolls the virtual die.
- **Outcome**:
  - The number rolled is added to the player's current score.
  - **Odd Number Rolled (1, 3, 5)**:
    - The player may choose to **roll again** or **pass**.
  - **Even Number Rolled (2, 4, 6)**:
    - The player's turn **ends immediately**.
- **Risk of Overshooting**:
  - If a player's score exceeds **20** at any point, their score is reset to **0**, and their turn ends.

### 2. Passing

- A player may choose to pass at any time during their turn, even before rolling.
- Passing ends the player's turn, and their current score remains unchanged.
- Strategically passing can prevent the risk of overshooting the target score.

### 3. Scoring

- **Score Accumulation**: Players accumulate points based on the numbers rolled.
- **Score Reset**:
  - Exceeding a score of 20 resets the player's score to **0**.
  - Example: A player with 18 points rolls a 4, bringing the total to 22. Their score resets to 0.

## Winning the Game

- The first player to reach **exactly 20 points** wins.
- If both players reach 20 in the same round, the player who reached it on their turn wins.
- There is **no draw mechanism**; gameplay continues until one player wins.

## Strategy Tips

- **Assess Risk**: If close to 20, consider passing to avoid resetting your score.
- **Opponent's Score**: Be mindful of your opponent's score when deciding to take risks.
- **Probability**: Remember that rolling an even number ends your turn and increases the chance of overshooting if you're close to 20.
