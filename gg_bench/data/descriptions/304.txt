# Odd-Even Elimination

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a valid move by strategically removing numbers from a shared list according to the odd-even elimination rules.

## Setup

1. **Number Range**: The game begins with a consecutive list of numbers from **1** to **20**.
2. **Players**: Two players participate, taking turns.
3. **Initial Conditions**: No numbers have been removed at the start of the game.

## Game Components

- **Number List**: A shared list containing the numbers **1** to **20**.
  - **Appearance**: The numbers are displayed in ascending order.
  - **Functionality**: Players remove numbers from this list based on the game rules.
  - **Unique Attributes**: Once a number is removed, it cannot be selected again.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player removes one valid number from the list.
  2. **Turn Progression**: Turns alternate between the two players.
- **First Turn**: The first player can remove any number from the list since no numbers have been removed yet.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - If the **last number removed** was **odd**, the next player must remove an **even** number.
   - If the **last number removed** was **even**, the next player must remove an **odd** number.
2. **Removal Constraints**:
   - **Available Numbers**: Players can only remove numbers that are still in the list and meet the odd or even requirement based on the last move.
   - **No Repeats**: Once a number is removed, it cannot be selected again.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player **loses** if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The **other player wins** by default.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Invalid Moves**: If a player attempts to remove an invalid number (e.g., wrong parity or already removed), they lose their turn, and the opponent gets an extra turn.
- **Strategic Considerations**:
  - Players should track which numbers have been removed to plan future moves.
  - Anticipating the opponent's options can provide a strategic advantage.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: The game is won by the player who successfully makes the last valid move, leaving the opponent without any valid options.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use a points system; victory is determined solely by the ability to make a valid move when the opponent cannot.
