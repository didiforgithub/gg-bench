In the Factor Challenge game, the action space indices (0 to 18) map directly to the numbers available for selection in the game, ranging from 2 to 20. Specifically, an action index `i` corresponds to selecting the number `i + 2`. This mapping allows players to choose numbers from the number pool using their respective indices within the defined action space of the gym environment.
