In the code, the action space indices map to game moves as follows: each action index in the range 0-8 corresponds to a digit from 1 to 9. Specifically, action index 0 maps to digit 1, index 1 to digit 2, and so on, up to index 8 mapping to digit 9. This mapping allows players to select digits to add or subtract from the shared number as per the game rules.
