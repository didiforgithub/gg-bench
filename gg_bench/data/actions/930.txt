In the game environment, the action space is a discrete set with 185 possible actions, corresponding to the movement and special commands each token can perform. Each player has 5 tokens, and each token can take one of 37 possible actions:

1. **Movement Actions (0-3 per token):**
   - 0: Move Up
   - 1: Move Down
   - 2: Move Left
   - 3: Move Right

2. **Jump Actions (4-28 per token):**
   - Move to any cell within a Manhattan distance of 2 (there are 25 jump possibilities for each token).

3. **Swap Actions (29-32 per token):**
   - Swap positions with any other friendly token (4 possibilities for each token, since it can swap with any one of the four other tokens).

4. **Block Actions (33-36 per token):**
   - Place a block in one of the four cardinal directions around the token.

The action space index is calculated using: `action_index = token_index * 37 + sub_action_index`, where `token_index` is the specific token (0-4 per player) and `sub_action_index` reflects the specific action type and parameters.
