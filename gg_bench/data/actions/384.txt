In the action space, indices 0 to 9 correspond to the numbers 1 to 10 in the game. When a player selects an action, the index represents one less than the chosen number. For example, an action index of 0 indicates that the player selects number 1, an index of 1 indicates number 2, and so on up to an index of 9, which indicates number 10. This mapping allows the environment to directly interpret the chosen actions as the specific numbers used in the game.
