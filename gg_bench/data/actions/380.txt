In the Grid Conqueror game implemented in the CustomEnv environment, the action space consists of 9 discrete actions, corresponding to the 9 squares on the 3x3 grid. Each action index from 0 to 8 maps to a grid position as follows:

- Index 0: Corresponds to grid position (1,1)
- Index 1: Corresponds to grid position (1,2)
- Index 2: Corresponds to grid position (1,3)
- Index 3: Corresponds to grid position (2,1)
- Index 4: Corresponds to grid position (2,2)
- Index 5: Corresponds to grid position (2,3)
- Index 6: Corresponds to grid position (3,1)
- Index 7: Corresponds to grid position (3,2)
- Index 8: Corresponds to grid position (3,3) 

Thus, action indices directly map to the grid positions row by row from top-left to bottom-right.
