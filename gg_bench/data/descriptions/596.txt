# Binary Battle: Rule Book

## Objective

**Binary Battle** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to transform your binary number into the **target binary number** through strategic bit manipulation. Victory is achieved by flipping bits—either in your own binary number or in your opponent's—to match the target number exactly.

## Setup

1. **Target Binary Number**: At the start of the game, a **target binary number** of 4 bits (e.g., `1010`) is agreed upon or randomly selected.
2. **Initial Player Binaries**: Both players begin with their own 4-bit binary numbers set to `0000`.
3. **Player Assignment**: Decide which player will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or randomly (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Binary Numbers**: Each player has a 4-bit binary number displayed as a sequence of 0s and 1s (e.g., `0101`).
- **Bits**: Individual digits within the binary number, indexed from left to right as positions 1 to 4.
- **Target Binary Number**: A 4-bit binary number that players strive to match with their own binary number.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately. The game starts with **Player 1**.
- **Player Actions**: On their turn, a player must perform **one** of the following actions:
  1. **Flip One Bit in Own Binary**: Change a `0` to a `1` or a `1` to a `0` in their own binary number at a chosen position (1-4).
  2. **Flip One Bit in Opponent's Binary**: Change a `0` to a `1` or a `1` to a `0` in the opponent's binary number at a chosen position (1-4).
- **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their action, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Bit Flipping**:
   - Players specify which bit to flip by indicating the position (1 to 4).
   - Only one bit may be flipped per turn.
2. **Action Restrictions**:
   - A player **must** flip a bit on their turn; passing is not allowed.
   - Players can choose to flip a bit in their own binary or their opponent's binary, but not both.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins immediately if, after their turn, their own binary number exactly matches the **target binary number**.
4. **Game End Conditions**:
   - The game ends when a player wins by matching the target binary number.
   - The game cannot end in a draw.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who first matches the target binary number wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no point tracking; the game outcome is win or lose based on achieving the objective.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Setup:

- **Target Binary Number**: `1011`
- **Player 1's Binary**: `0000`

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Flips bit **1** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `1000`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0000`

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Flips bit **4** of Player 1's binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `1001`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0000`

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Flips bit **2** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `1101`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0000`

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action**: Flips bit **3** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `1101`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0010`

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Action**: Flips bit **3** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `1111`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0010`
- **Check for Win**: Player 1's binary `1111` does **not** match the target `1011`.

#### Turn 6: Player 2

- **Action**: Flips bit **1** of Player 1's binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `0111`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0010`

#### Turn 7: Player 1

- **Action**: Flips bit **2** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `0011`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0010`
- **Check for Win**: Player 1's binary `0011` does **not** match the target `1011`.

#### Turn 8: Player 2

- **Action**: Flips bit **4** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `0011`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0011`

#### Turn 9: Player 1

- **Action**: Flips bit **1** of their own binary.
- **Result**:
  - Player 1's Binary: `1011`
  - Player 2's Binary: `0011`
- **Check for Win**: Player 1's binary `1011` matches the target `1011`.
- **Outcome**: **Player 1 wins the game!**

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

#### Game Start

```
Welcome to Binary Battle!
Target Binary Number: 1011
Player 1's Binary: 0000
Player 2's Binary: 0000

Player 1's Turn:
Choose action:
1. Flip your own bit
2. Flip opponent's bit
Enter action number (1 or 2): 1
Enter bit position to flip (1-4): 1

Result:
Player 1's Binary: 1000
Player 2's Binary: 0000
```

#### Next Turn

```
Player 2's Turn:
Choose action:
1. Flip your own bit
2. Flip opponent's bit
Enter action number (1 or 2): 2
Enter bit position to flip in opponent's binary (1-4): 4

Result:
Player 1's Binary: 1001
Player 2's Binary: 0000
```

*...game continues until a player wins...*

## Strategy Tips

- **Balancing Offense and Defense**: Decide whether it's more advantageous to improve your own binary number or hinder your opponent's progress.
- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Keep track of both binaries and the target to predict your opponent's strategy.
- **Bit Position Importance**: Some bits are more critical than others based on the target number; prioritize flipping these bits.

## Conclusion

**Binary Battle** is a quick and strategic game that tests players' tactical decision-making skills in binary manipulation. With simple rules and deep strategy, players can enjoy a unique and engaging experience in a command-line setting.
