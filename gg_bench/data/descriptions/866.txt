**Game Title:** Capture Squares

---

## **Objective**

Capture Squares is a two-player turn-based strategy game. The primary goal is to gain the highest total score by capturing numbered squares on a shared grid. Players strategically select squares to maximize their score while limiting their opponent's opportunities. The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Game Board:** The game is played on a 3x3 grid, consisting of 9 squares.

2. **Number Assignment:** Each square is assigned a unique number from 1 to 9. These numbers are randomly distributed across the grid at the start of the game. All numbers are visible to both players.

3. **Player Roles:**
   - **Player 1:** Takes the first turn.
   - **Player 2:** Takes the second turn.

---

## **Game Components**

- **3x3 Grid:** Represents the game board with positions labeled for reference (e.g., positions 1 to 9 or coordinates).

- **Numbered Squares:** Each square contains a distinct number from 1 to 9. The numbers serve both as the score value and as a strategic element for capturing additional squares.

- **Score Tracker:** A method (such as a notepad or built-in score display) to keep track of each player's total score throughout the game.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The game is played via text-based commands entered into a command-line interface.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

2. **Actions Per Turn:**
   - **Selection Phase:** The active player selects one available (uncaptured) square on the grid.
   - **Capture Phase:** The active player captures the selected square and any eligible adjacent squares.
   - **Scoring Phase:** The captured squares' numbers are added to the active player's total score.
   - **Update Phase:** The grid is updated to reflect captured squares, and the turn passes to the other player.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **1. Square Selection**

- On your turn, you must select any one available square on the grid.
- The selected square is immediately captured and removed from the grid.

### **2. Capturing Adjacent Squares**

- After capturing the selected square, you may also capture any orthogonally adjacent squares (up, down, left, right) if they meet the following condition:
  - **Capture Condition:** The number in the adjacent square is **less than** the number in the square you selected.
- All captured adjacent squares are removed from the grid.

### **3. Scoring**

- Your score for the turn is the sum of the numbers in all squares you captured during that turn (the selected square plus any eligible adjacent squares).
- Keep a cumulative total of your score after each turn.

### **4. Game Progression**

- The game continues with players alternating turns until all squares on the grid have been captured.

### **5. Winning the Game**

- After all squares have been captured, the player with the **higher total score** wins the game.
- Since there are 45 points available (sum of numbers 1 to 9), ties are impossible under standard play. There is no draw mechanism.

---

## **Scoring**

- **Turn Score:** Sum of all numbers captured during a single turn.
- **Total Score:** Cumulative sum of all your turn scores.
- **Winning Condition:** Player with the highest total score at the end of the game.

### **Sample Turns**

#### **Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Selection:** Player 1 selects the square containing **9** at position (2,2).
- **Capturing Adjacent Squares:**

## **Strategic Considerations**

- **High-Value Squares:** Capturing squares with higher numbers may allow you to capture more adjacent squares, maximizing your turn score.

- **Denying Opponent:** Be mindful of which squares you leave available. Avoid leaving high-value squares that your opponent can exploit.

- **Capturing Opportunities:** Plan your moves to potentially block your opponent's access to advantageous captures.

- **Score Balance:** Keep track of the score difference. If you're leading, you may opt for safer moves to maintain your lead.

Capture Squares is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and make tactical decisions. With a quick setup and straightforward rules, it's perfect for a command-line interface and offers ample opportunity for skilled players to outmaneuver their opponents.
