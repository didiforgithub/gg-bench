In the game environment, the action space is represented by a discrete space of size 9, with indices ranging from 0 to 8. These indices map directly to the digits 1 through 9, where each index `i` corresponds to selecting the digit `i + 1` for the current turn. For example, choosing the action with index 0 results in selecting the digit 1, and choosing the action with index 8 results in selecting the digit 9. This mapping allows players to choose which digit from the available pool to append to the current number they are forming as part of their move.
