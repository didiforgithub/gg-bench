In the provided gym environment for the Prime Reduction Game, the action space indices map to moves as follows:

- **Action 0**: Subtract 1 from the current value of N.
- **Actions 1-10**: Represent dividing N by its unique prime factors. Each index corresponds to a specific prime factor of N, ordered by magnitude. For example, if N has three unique prime factors 2, 3, and 5, then:
  - **Action 1**: Divide N by 2,
  - **Action 2**: Divide N by 3,
  - **Action 3**: Divide N by 5.

The mapping is dynamic and specific to the current prime factors of N, constrained to a maximum of 10 possible prime factor actions.
