In the game, actions are represented by indices in a discrete action space, which map to movements as follows:  
- **0** corresponds to moving **up** (decrement the row index by 1).  
- **1** corresponds to moving **down** (increment the row index by 1).  
- **2** corresponds to moving **left** (decrement the column index by 1).  
- **3** corresponds to moving **right** (increment the column index by 1).
