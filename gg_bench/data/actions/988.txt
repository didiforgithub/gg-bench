In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 48, corresponding to the numbers from 2 to 50 inclusive. Each index represents a specific number in this range, calculated by adding 2 to the index. This means:
- Index 0 corresponds to number 2 (0 + 2 = 2),
- Index 1 corresponds to number 3 (1 + 2 = 3), 
- ...
- Index 48 corresponds to number 50 (48 + 2 = 50). 

This mapping facilitates the conversion of action space indices to specific numbers within the game, enabling players to select numbers according to the game rules.
