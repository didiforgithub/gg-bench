# Factor Frenzy

## Objective

**Factor Frenzy** is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move according to the game rules. This occurs when the current number is either prime (has no proper divisors other than 1 and itself) or is 1 on their turn. The last player to make a valid move wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**:
   - Players agree on a starting positive integer greater than 1. This number will be referred to as the **Current Number**.
   - For a quick game, it's recommended to choose a number between 10 and 100. Example starting numbers: 30, 42, 60.

2. **Player Roles**:
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Game Interface**:
   - The game is played in a command-line interface (CLI), where players input their chosen divisors when prompted.

---

## Game Components

1. **Current Number**:
   - This is the shared number that players will modify throughout the game.
   - It starts as the **Starting Number** and changes as players make moves.

2. **Proper Divisors**:
   - Divisors of the Current Number excluding 1 and the number itself.
   - Only proper divisors are eligible for moves.

3. **Player Actions**:
   - Each player needs to be able to:
     - Identify proper divisors of the Current Number.
     - Input their chosen divisor into the CLI.
     - Calculate the new Current Number.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - **Player 1** takes the first turn.
   - Players alternate turns thereafter.

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Display Current Number**: The game shows the Current Number.
   - **List Proper Divisors**: Players identify all proper divisors of the Current Number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
   - **Choose Divisor**: The player selects one of the proper divisors.
   - **Update Current Number**: The Current Number is divided by the chosen divisor.
   - **End Turn**: The new Current Number is announced, and the turn passes to the opponent.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you must:
     - Select a proper divisor of the Current Number (greater than 1 and less than the Current Number).
     - Divide the Current Number by this divisor.
     - Ensure the result is a whole number (no fractions or decimals).

2. **Invalid Moves**:
   - **Passing**: You cannot skip your turn if a valid move is available.
   - **Invalid Divisors**: You cannot choose 1 or the Current Number itself as a divisor.
   - **Non-Divisors**: You cannot choose a number that is not a proper divisor of the Current Number.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn because:
     - The Current Number has no proper divisors (it's a prime number).
     - The Current Number is 1.
   - Then you lose the game, and your opponent wins.

4. **Ending the Game**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: The player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no point or scoring system; the outcome is a win or loss.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Number**: 30

---

#### Player 1's Turn:

- **Current Number**: 30
- **Proper Divisors**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **5**
- **Calculation**: 30 รท 5 = **6**
- **New Current Number**: 6

---

#### Player 2's Turn:

- **Current Number**: 6
- **Proper Divisors**: 2, 3
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **2**
- **Calculation**: 6 รท 2 = **3**
- **New Current Number**: 3

---

#### Player 1's Turn:

- **Current Number**: 3
- **Proper Divisors**: None (3 is prime)
- **Outcome**: No valid moves available.
- **Result**: **Player 1 loses**, Player 2 wins.

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

```
Game Start! The Starting Number is 30.

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number: 30
Proper Divisors (excluding 1 and 30): 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Choose a divisor: 5
You chose 5.
New Current Number: 30 / 5 = 6

Player 2's Turn:
Current Number: 6
Proper Divisors (excluding 1 and 6): 2, 3
Choose a divisor: 2
You chose 2.
New Current Number: 6 / 2 = 3

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number: 3
No proper divisors available. 3 is a prime number.
No valid moves left. Player 1 loses.
Congratulations, Player 2! You win the game.
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Anticipate the results of your moves not just for your next turn, but for subsequent turns.
  - Aim to leave your opponent with a prime number or 1, which forces them into a losing position.

- **Choose Divisors Wisely**:
  - Sometimes selecting a smaller divisor can be more strategic if it leads to a prime number on your opponent's turn.
  - Be cautious of divisors that result in numbers with many proper divisors on your opponent's turn.

- **Memorize Prime Numbers**:
  - Familiarity with prime numbers can help you quickly identify winning moves.

- **Control the Game Flow**:
  - Try to steer the Current Number toward numbers that limit your opponent's options.
