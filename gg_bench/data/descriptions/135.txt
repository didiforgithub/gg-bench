# Number Line Battle

## Objective

Be the player who controls the longest continuous sequence of numbers on the number line. Players take turns claiming numbers, strategically planning to build the longest possible uninterrupted segment. At the end of the game, the player with the longest consecutive sequence of claimed numbers wins. If there is a tie in length, the player with the higher sum of numbers within their longest sequence wins.

## Setup

- **Number Line:** A shared number line ranging from **1** to **20**, with each number initially unclaimed.
- **Players:** Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Markers:** Each player has a unique marker to indicate claimed numbers:
  - **Player 1:** `X`
  - **Player 2:** `O`

The game begins with an empty number line:

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
```

## Game Components

- **Number Line (1-20):** Represents the playing field where players claim numbers.
- **Player Markers (`X` and `O`):** Used to indicate which numbers have been claimed by which player.
- **Claimed Numbers List:** Each player maintains a list of numbers they have claimed.

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions Per Turn:** On their turn, a player must:
  1. **Select a Number:** Choose any unclaimed number from the number line.
  2. **Claim the Number:** Mark the chosen number with their marker (`X` or `O`).

- **Turn Progression:** The game continues with players alternating turns until all numbers on the number line have been claimed.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Claiming Numbers:**
   - Players can claim any unclaimed number on their turn.
   - Once a number is claimed, it cannot be claimed by the other player.

2. **Objective Building:**
   - Players aim to create the longest continuous sequence (segment) of numbers they have claimed on the number line.

3. **End of Game:**
   - The game ends when all numbers from **1** to **20** have been claimed.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - **Primary Condition:** The player with the longest continuous sequence of claimed numbers wins.
   - **Tie-Breaker:** If both players have continuous sequences of equal length:
     - The player with the higher **sum** of numbers within their longest sequence wins.
     - If the sums are equal, the player who took the **second turn** (Player 2) wins.

## Scoring

- **Continuous Sequence:** A series of numbers claimed by a player that are consecutive on the number line without any interruptions by the opponent's claims.

- **Example of Scoring:**
  - **Player 1's Longest Sequence:** Positions 5-9 (Length = 5; Sum = 35)
  - **Player 2's Longest Sequence:** Positions 12-16 (Length = 5; Sum = 70)
  - **Winner:** Player 2 wins due to a higher sum of 70.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

**Initial Number Line:**

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
```

**Turn Sequence:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Claims number **10**
   - Number Line:

     ```
     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  X  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
     ```

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Claims number **11**
   - Number Line:

     ```
     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  X  O  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
     ```

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Claims number **9**
   - Number Line:

     ```
     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  X  X  O  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
     ```

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Claims number **12**
   - Number Line:

     ```
     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  X  X  O  O  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
     ```

5. **Proceeding Turns:**
   - Players continue claiming numbers, aiming to build their longest sequences while blocking their opponent.

**End of Game Scenario:**

- **Player 1's Claimed Numbers:** 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- **Player 2's Claimed Numbers:** 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

- **Player 1's Longest Sequence:** Positions 5-10 (Length = 6)
- **Player 2's Longest Sequence:** Positions 11-15 (Length = 5)

**Winner:** Player 1 wins due to a longer sequence.

### Command-Line Interaction

**Example Turn:**

- **Prompt:** `Player 1's turn. Available numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20`
- **Input:** `Player 1 selects number 10`
- **Output:**

  ```
  Number Line:
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  X  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
  ```

- **Prompt:** `Player 2's turn. Available numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20`
- **Input:** `Player 2 selects number 11`
- **Output:**

  ```
  Number Line:
  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  X  O  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20
  ```

**At Game End:**

- **Final Number Line:**

  ```
  X  O  X  O  X  X  X  X  X  X  O  O  O  O  O  X  O  X  O  X
  ```

- **Player 1's Longest Sequence:** Positions 5-10 (Length = 6)
- **Player 2's Longest Sequence:** Positions 11-15 (Length = 5)
- **Winner Announcement:** `Player 1 wins with the longest sequence of length 6!`

## Strategic Tips

- **Blocking Opponent:** Pay attention to your opponent's claimed numbers and strategically claim numbers that interrupt their potential sequences.

- **Building Sequences:** Focus on claiming adjacent numbers to build your longest possible sequence.

- **Resource Limitation:** Since the number of available numbers decreases each turn, plan ahead to ensure you can extend your sequence.

- **Tie-Breaker Awareness:** If sequence lengths might tie, aim to claim higher numbers to increase the sum within your sequence.

## Conclusion

"Number Line Battle" is a game of strategic thinking and planning. Each move can either strengthen your position or open opportunities for your opponent. By carefully selecting numbers and anticipating your opponent's strategy, you can control the longest continuous segment and secure victory.

Enjoy the battle of numbers!
