# Grid Snatchers: Rule Book

## Objective

Be the first player to **capture the opponent's token** by moving onto its position on a 5x5 grid.

---

## Setup

- **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid with coordinates ranging from **(1,1)** to **(5,5)**.
  
- **Player Tokens**:
  - **Player 1**:
    - Starts at the **top-left corner** of the grid at position **(1,1)**.
  - **Player 2**:
    - Starts at the **bottom-right corner** of the grid at position **(5,5)**.

---

## Game Components

- **Grid**:
  - Represents the game board.
  - Each cell is identified by coordinates **(x, y)** where **1 ≤ x, y ≤ 5**.

- **Tokens**:
  - Each player has one token.
  - **Appearance**: Tokens can be represented by unique symbols or colors in the interface (e.g., `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2).
  
- **Movement Options**:
  - Tokens can move in the four cardinal directions:
    - **Up**
    - **Down**
    - **Left**
    - **Right**
  - Movement is in **straight lines** only, and **diagonal moves are not allowed**.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.

- **Player Actions During a Turn**:
  1. **Select Direction**:
     - Choose one of the four directions: up, down, left, or right.
  2. **Select Number of Spaces**:
     - Move the token **1 or 2 spaces** in the chosen direction.
  3. **Move Token**:
     - Update the token's position on the grid accordingly.
     - Ensure the move stays within the grid bounds.
  
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After a player completes their move, control passes to the other player.
  - The game continues until one player captures the opponent's token.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Valid Moves**:
  - A token may move **up to two spaces** per turn.
  - Moves must be in a **straight line** along a row or column.
  - The token cannot move **outside the grid bounds**.
  
- **Blocking and Occupying Cells**:
  - Tokens **cannot pass through** or **occupy the same space** as the opponent's token unless capturing.
  - **No Skipping**:
    - There are no obstacles; tokens can move freely unless the opponent's token blocks the path.

### Capture Mechanism

- **Capturing the Opponent's Token**:
  - A player **captures** the opponent's token by moving their token **onto the cell occupied** by the opponent.
  - The player who performs the capture **immediately wins** the game.

### Winning Conditions

- **Victory**:
  - Capture the opponent's token by landing on their position.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game continues until one player wins; there are **no draw conditions**.

---

## Scoring

- **Win**:
  - The player who captures the opponent's token is declared the **winner**.
- **Game End**:
  - The game ends immediately upon a successful capture.

## Examples

### Example Turn Sequence

**Initial Setup**:

- **Player 1** is at position **(1,1)**.
- **Player 2** is at position **(5,5)**.

---

**Turn 1 (Player 1)**:

- **Action**: Move **up** 2 spaces.
- **Movement**: From **(1,1)** to **(1,3)**.
- **Comment**: Player 1 advances toward the center.

---

**Turn 2 (Player 2)**:

- **Action**: Move **left** 2 spaces.
- **Movement**: From **(5,5)** to **(3,5)**.
- **Comment**: Player 2 mirrors the movement toward the center.

---

**Turn 3 (Player 1)**:

- **Action**: Move **right** 2 spaces.
- **Movement**: From **(1,3)** to **(3,3)**.
- **Comment**: Player 1 positions towards the center to anticipate Player 2.

---

**Turn 4 (Player 2)**:

- **Action**: Move **up** 2 spaces.
- **Movement**: From **(3,5)** to **(3,3)**.
- **Outcome**: Player 2 captures Player 1's token.
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins the game**.

## Command-Line Interactions

**Player 1's Turn**:

```
Player 1, enter your move:
Direction (up/down/left/right): up
Number of spaces (1 or 2): 2
You moved to position (1,3).
```

**Player 2's Turn**:

```
Player 2, enter your move:
Direction (up/down/left/right): left
Number of spaces (1 or 2): 2
You moved to position (3,5).
```

**Subsequent Turns** follow similar input patterns, with the game providing feedback on the token's new position and checking for capture conditions.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipation**:
  - Predict the opponent's potential moves and plan to counter or avoid them.
  
- **Control the Center**:
  - Occupying central positions increases your movement options and ability to intercept the opponent.
  
- **Movement Choices**:
  - Deciding between moving 1 or 2 spaces can set up offensive or defensive positions.
  
- **Cutting Off Paths**:
  - Position your token to limit the opponent's movement options, potentially forcing them into a capture.

## Game Summary

- **Simple Mechanics**:
  - Easy to learn and quick to play, suitable for a command-line interface.
  
- **Skill-Based Outcomes**:
  - Encourages strategic thinking; skilled players can consistently outperform less experienced opponents.
  
- **Unique Gameplay**:
  - Offers a distinct experience not directly resembling classic games like Go, Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe, or Chess.
