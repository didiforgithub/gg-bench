In the custom gym environment for the Number Tower game, the action space consists of discrete values from 0 to 8, which map directly to the game numbers 1 through 9. The index 0 corresponds to placing the number 1, index 1 corresponds to placing the number 2, and so on, up to index 8, which corresponds to placing the number 9. This mapping allows actions to be selected using indices, which are then translated to the game's numerical moves by adding 1 to the index.
