The action space indices correspond directly to the positions in the `number_list`. Each index from 0 to 9 represents a unique integer present in the `number_list`, and selecting an index as an action indicates choosing the number at that position. For example, if `number_list` is `[2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20]`, then action index 0 corresponds to choosing `2`, index 1 to `5`, and so on. Choosing an index means selecting and removing the number at that position from the list, influencing the player's score and the potential application of the Snatch mechanic based on that specific selection.
