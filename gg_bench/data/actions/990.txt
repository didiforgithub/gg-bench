The action space indices (0-3) in the game map directly to the cell numbers (1-4) in the game. Choosing action index 0 corresponds to selecting Cell 1, index 1 to Cell 2, index 2 to Cell 3, and index 3 to Cell 4. This mapping enables players to increment the token count in the selected cell by using the respective action index during their turn.
