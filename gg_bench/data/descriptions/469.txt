**Multiples and Factors**

---

**Objective**

The primary goal of *Multiples and Factors* is to be the last player able to make a valid move by selecting an unused number according to the game's rules. Players aim to strategically choose numbers to force their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

**Setup**

- **Number Set**: A consecutive list of positive integers from 1 to **N**, where **N** is agreed upon by both players before the game starts. For quick gameplay, **N = 10** is recommended.
  
- **Used Numbers List**: An initially empty list that tracks the numbers already selected during the game.

- **Available Numbers**: All numbers from the number set that have not yet been selected.

- **Starting Conditions**: No numbers have been chosen, and it's Player 1's turn to start the game.

---

**Game Components**

- **Number Set**: Represents the pool of numbers from which players can select. Example: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`.

- **Used Numbers List**: Keeps track of numbers that have been selected. This prevents reuse of numbers. Initially empty.

- **Current Number**: The number selected in the previous turn that dictates the valid selections for the next player.

---

**Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, beginning with Player 1.

- **Player Actions**:
  1. **Selection**: Choose an unused number from the available numbers.
  2. **Validation**: Ensure the chosen number is a **factor** or a **multiple** of the current number (except on the first turn).
  3. **Update Lists**: Add the chosen number to the Used Numbers List and remove it from the Available Numbers.
  4. **Set Current Number**: The chosen number becomes the new current number for the next turn.

- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players taking turns until one player cannot make a valid move.

---

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Turn**:
   - Player 1 may select any number from the Number Set to start the game.
   - There is no current number constraint on the first move.

2. **Subsequent Turns**:
   - Players must select an unused number that is either a **factor** or a **multiple** of the current number.
   - A **factor** divides the current number exactly without leaving a remainder.
   - A **multiple** is the product of the current number and any positive integer within the Number Set.
   - If a player cannot select a valid number, they lose the game.

3. **Selection Constraints**:
   - **Unused Numbers Only**: Players cannot select numbers already in the Used Numbers List.
   - **Within Number Set**: Selections must be within the initial Number Set.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins by making a valid move when their opponent cannot make a subsequent valid move.
   - There are no draws in this game; play continues until a winner is determined.

---

**Scoring**

- No points are tracked in the game.
- The outcome is a binary win or loss, determined by a player's ability to make valid moves.
- The focus is on strategic selection rather than cumulative scoring.

- **Used Numbers**: `{}`
- **Current Number**: `None`

**Turn-by-Turn Play**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Chooses **7** (any number is valid on the first turn).
   - **Used Numbers**: `{7}`
   - **Available Numbers**: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}`
   - **Current Number**: `7`

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Possible Choices**: Factors or multiples of **7** from available numbers.
   - **Factors of 7**: `{1}`
   - **Multiples of 7**: No multiples within 1-10 other than 7 (already used).
   - **Action**: Chooses **1**.
   - **Used Numbers**: `{7, 1}`

   - **Current Number**: `1`

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Possible Choices**: Any unused number (since every number is a multiple of 1).
   - **Action**: Chooses **2**.
   - **Used Numbers**: `{7, 1, 2}`
   - **Available Numbers**: `{3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}`
   - **Current Number**: `2`

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Possible Choices**: Factors or multiples of **2** from available numbers.
   - **Factors of 2**: None (1 and 2 are used).
   - **Multiples of 2**: `{4, 6, 8, 10}`
   - **Action**: Chooses **4**.
   - **Used Numbers**: `{7, 1, 2, 4}`
   - **Available Numbers**: `{3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}`
   - **Current Number**: `4`

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Possible Choices**: Factors or multiples of **4** from available numbers.
   - **Factors of 4**: `{}` (1, 2, and 4 are used).
   - **Multiples of 4**: `{8}`
   - **Action**: Chooses **8**.
   - **Used Numbers**: `{7, 1, 2, 4, 8}`
   - **Available Numbers**: `{3, 5, 6, 9, 10}`
   - **Current Number**: `8`

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Possible Choices**: Factors or multiples of **8** from available numbers.
   - **Factors of 8**: `{}` (1, 2, 4, and 8 are used).
   - **Multiples of 8**: `{}` (No multiples within available numbers).
   - **Action**: Cannot make a valid move.
   - **Result**: **Player 1 wins the game.**

**Strategic Depth and Complexity**

- **Anticipation**: Players must think ahead to anticipate the implications of their selections on future moves.
  
- **Number Properties**: Understanding factors and multiples of numbers enhances strategic options.

- **Limiting Opponent's Moves**: Choosing numbers that minimize the opponent's valid options can secure a win.

- **Resource Management**: Since numbers cannot be reused, players must manage the finite set of available numbers wisely.

---

**Miscellaneous**

- **Variations**:
  - Adjust **N** to change game length and complexity.
  - Use larger number sets for a more challenging game, e.g., **N = 20**.
  
- **Education**:
  - Excellent for practicing number theory concepts such as factors and multiples.

- **Fair Play**:
  - Since Player 1 has the advantage of the first move, consider alternating who starts in subsequent games.
