# Number Stack

## Objective

Become the first player to reach a cumulative total of **exactly 100** in your stack without exceeding it. Use strategic play to hinder your opponent by removing numbers from their stack when opportunities arise.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players are required.
- **Starting Condition**: Both players begin with an empty stack.
- **Number Pool**: A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **10**. Numbers can be reused any number of times.

## Game Components

- **Player Stacks**: Each player maintains their own stack (a list) of numbers. The sum of the numbers in the stack is the player's current total.
  
  - *Example*: If your stack contains `[10, 5, 7]`, your total is `10 + 5 + 7 = 22`.

- **Shared Number Pool**: Numbers from **1** to **10** are available for players to select during their turns.

## Turns

Players take turns performing the following actions:

1. **Select a Number**: Choose a number between **1** and **10** (inclusive) from the shared pool.
2. **Add to Stack**: Place the chosen number on top of your stack.
3. **Calculate Total**: Sum all the numbers in your stack to get your new total.
4. **Check for Multiples of 10**: If your new total is a multiple of **10**, you may remove the top number from your opponent's stack.
5. **Check for Bust or Victory**:
   - If your total exceeds **100**, you bust and **lose** the game.
   - If your total is exactly **100**, you **win** the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Selecting Numbers

- On your turn, you **must** choose a number between **1** and **10**.
- The number is added to the top of your stack immediately.

### 2. Calculating Totals

- After adding the number, calculate your **new total** by summing all numbers in your stack.
- Keep track of your total throughout the game.

### 3. Multiples of 10 - Special Ability

- If your new total is a **multiple of 10** (e.g., 10, 20, 30, ..., 100), you **may** remove the top number from your opponent's stack.
- If the opponent's stack is empty, this action has no effect.
- The removed number is discarded from the game.
- This action is optional; you can choose not to remove a number from your opponent's stack.

### 4. Busting

- If your total **exceeds 100**, you **immediately lose** the game.
- Play carefully to avoid busting.

### 5. Winning the Game

- The first player to reach a total of **exactly 100** wins.
- If both players reach 100 on the same turn, the player with **fewer numbers** in their stack wins.
- If both players have the same total and stack size, play continues until the tie is broken.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by reaching exactly **100**.
- **Loss**: Occurs if a player's total exceeds **100** (busting).
- There is no point system beyond tracking the cumulative totals.
