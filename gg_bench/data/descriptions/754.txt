# Divisibility Duel

## Objective

The primary goal of **Divisibility Duel** is to be the first player to construct a number using unique digits that is **divisible by a predetermined target number**. Players take turns selecting digits from a shared pool and strategically placing them to form their personal number. The player who successfully creates such a number wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Digit Pool**: A shared pool containing the digits from **1** to **9**.
2. **Player Numbers**: Each player starts with an **empty number**.
3. **Target Number**: Players agree on a target number for divisibility before the game begins (e.g., **7**).
4. **Determine First Player**: Decide which player will take the first turn (e.g., by a coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Digits (1-9)**:
  - **Appearance**: Represented by their numerical values.
  - **Functionality**: Used by players to build their numbers.
  - **Unique Attribute**: Each digit can be used only once in the game.

- **Player Numbers**:
  - **Appearance**: A sequence of digits forming a whole number.
  - **Functionality**: Represents the player's current number in the game.
  - **Unique Attribute**: Can be extended by adding digits to the left or right.

- **Target Number**:
  - **Appearance**: A single predetermined number agreed upon before starting (e.g., **7**).
  - **Functionality**: The number by which players' numbers must be divisible to win.
  - **Unique Attribute**: Remains constant throughout the game.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Select a Digit**:
   - Choose any available digit from the shared digit pool.

2. **Place the Digit**:
   - Append the selected digit to **either the left or right** end of your existing number.

3. **Check for Victory**:
   - Determine if your new number is divisible by the target number.
     - **If divisible**: You win the game.
     - **If not divisible**: The game continues.

4. **Turn Progression**:
   - The turn passes to the other player.

### Actions Allowed During a Turn

- **Digit Selection**: Pick one digit per turn.
- **Digit Placement**: Decide where to place the digit (left or right of your current number).
- **Victory Check**: Verify divisibility after placement.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Digit Availability**:
   - The digits **1-9** are available in the shared pool at the start.
   - Each digit can be used **only once** in the game.

2. **Digit Placement**:
   - You must place the selected digit on **either end** of your current number.
   - **Middle insertion** is not allowed.

3. **Building Numbers**:
   - Your number starts empty and builds up as you add digits.
   - Example Sequence:
     - Turn 1: Number is `5`.
     - Turn 2: Add `3` to the left -> Number is `35`.
     - Turn 3: Add `7` to the right -> Number is `357`.

4. **Divisibility Check**:
   - After each turn, check if your number is divisible by the target number.
   - Use standard division to verify.
   - No remainders should result; the division must be exact.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have a number divisible by the target number immediately wins.
   - The game ends upon a win condition being met.

6. **Exhausting Digits**:
   - If all digits have been used and no player has won, the game proceeds to a **tie-breaker**.

### Special Mechanics

#### Tie-Breaker Rules

1. **Closeness to Divisibility**:
   - Calculate the **absolute difference** between each player's number and the nearest lower multiple of the target number.
   - The player with the **smaller difference** wins the tie-breaker.

2. **Example**:
   - Target Number: **7**
   - Player 1's Number: **428** (428 ÷ 7 = 61.14; nearest lower multiple is 427, difference is 1)
   - Player 2's Number: **395** (395 ÷ 7 = 56.42; nearest lower multiple is 392, difference is 3)
   - **Player 1 wins** because their number is closer to a multiple of 7.

3. **Tie in Differences**:
   - If both players have the same difference, the game is declared a **draw**.

## Scoring

- **Winning**:
  - Achieve a number divisible by the target number during your turn.
  - Immediate victory; the game ends.

- **Tie-Breaker Victory**:
  - If no immediate win, the closer number to a multiple of the target number after all digits are used wins.

- **No Points System**:
  - The game operates on a win/loss basis per round.
  - No cumulative scoring is involved.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

**Target Number**: **7**

**Digit Pool at Start**: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

#### Game Play

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Selects Digit**: `4`
  - **Places Digit**: Right end (Number: `4`)
  - **Divisibility Check**: `4` ÷ `7` → Not divisible.

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Selects Digit**: `3`
  - **Places Digit**: Right end (Number: `3`)
  - **Divisibility Check**: `3` ÷ `7` → Not divisible.

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Selects Digit**: `2`
  - **Places Digit**: Right end (Number: `42`)
  - **Divisibility Check**: `42` ÷ `7` = `6` → **Divisible! Player 1 wins.**

### Command-Line Interaction

```
Welcome to Divisibility Duel!
Target Number: 7

Available Digits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Player 1's Turn:
- Select a digit from the available digits: 4
- Place digit '4' on (L)eft or (R)ight of your number? R
- Your Number: 4
- Checking divisibility by 7... Not divisible.

Player 2's Turn:
- Available Digits: 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
- Select a digit from the available digits: 3
- Place digit '3' on (L)eft or (R)ight of your number? R
- Your Number: 3
- Checking divisibility by 7... Not divisible.

Player 1's Turn:
- Available Digits: 1 2 5 6 7 8 9
- Select a digit from the available digits: 2
- Place digit '2' on (L)eft or (R)ight of your number? R
- Your Number: 42
- Checking divisibility by 7... Divisible!
Congratulations, Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Anticipate which digits will help you achieve divisibility.
  - Consider the mathematical impact of adding a digit to the left versus the right.

- **Deny Key Digits**:
  - Observe which digits your opponent may need and consider selecting them.

- **Balance Your Number**:
  - Keep your number flexible to maximize future opportunities for divisibility.

- **Mathematical Calculations**:
  - Familiarize yourself with multiples of the target number to quickly assess potential moves.

## Additional Rules and Variants

### Variable Target Number

- **Changing Targets**:
  - Players can agree to change the target number each game to add variety.
  - Example: Use prime numbers like 11 or 13 for increased difficulty.

### Expanded Digit Pool

- **Including Zero**:
  - Add the digit `0` to the pool for more options.
  - Placing `0` can significantly alter a number's divisibility.

### Multiple Wins

- **Best of Series**:
  - Play a series of games, and the player who wins the most rounds wins the series.

### Time Limit per Turn

- **Timed Turns**:
  - Implement a time limit for each turn to increase the challenge.
