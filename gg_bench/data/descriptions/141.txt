# Divide and Conquer - Rule Book

## Objective

Be the last player to make a valid move by strategically dividing the shared number **N** by its prime factors. Force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move, thereby securing your victory.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer **N**. The default starting number is **100**, but players may agree on any positive integer greater than **1**.

2. **Players**: Two players participate, alternating turns throughout the game.

3. **Game State**: The current value of **N** is shared and updated after each turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that players will manipulate according to the game rules.

- **Prime Factors**: The set of prime numbers that divide into **N** without leaving a remainder. These are essential for making valid moves.

- **Command-Line Interface**: All interactions occur through text prompts and inputs in a command-line environment.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions**:

   - **View Current N**: At the start of your turn, note the current value of **N**.

   - **Determine Prime Factors**: Identify all prime factors of **N**.

   - **Choose a Prime Factor**: Select one prime factor to divide **N** by.

   - **Update N**: Divide **N** by the chosen prime factor and announce the new value.

3. **Turn Progression**: After updating **N**, the turn passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:

   - You must divide **N** by one of its prime factors greater than **1**.

   - The chosen prime factor must divide **N** exactly, with no remainder.

2. **Updating N**:

   - After division, the new value of **N** becomes the current game state.

   - **N** must always remain a positive integer greater than or equal to **1**.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - If **N** is **1** at the start of your turn and you have no valid moves (since **1** has no prime factors greater than **1**), you lose the game.

   - The last player to make a valid move **(i.e., the player who reduces N to 1)** wins.

4. **Invalid Moves**:

   - Choosing a number that is not a prime factor of **N** is not allowed.

   - Attempting to divide by a prime factor that does not divide **N** exactly is invalid.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who makes the last valid move (reducing **N** to **1**) wins the game.

- **Defeat**: The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting with N = 100**

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N** is **100**.
   - Prime factors of **100**: **2**, **2**, **5**, **5**.
   - Player 1 chooses to divide by **2**.
   - **N** becomes **50** (`100 / 2`).
   - *Announce*: "Player 1 divides by 2. N is now 50."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **N** is **50**.
   - Prime factors of **50**: **2**, **5**, **5**.
   - Player 2 chooses to divide by **5**.
   - **N** becomes **10** (`50 / 5`).
   - *Announce*: "Player 2 divides by 5. N is now 10."

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N** is **10**.
   - Prime factors of **10**: **2**, **5**.
   - Player 1 chooses to divide by **2**.
   - **N** becomes **5** (`10 / 2`).
   - *Announce*: "Player 1 divides by 2. N is now 5."

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **N** is **5**.
   - Prime factors of **5**: **5**.
   - Player 2 chooses to divide by **5**.
   - **N** becomes **1** (`5 / 5`).
   - *Announce*: "Player 2 divides by 5. N is now 1."

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **N** is **1**.
   - **N** has no prime factors greater than **1**.
   - Player 1 cannot make a valid move and loses.
   - *Announce*: "Player 1 has no valid moves. Player 2 wins!"

## Command-Line Interactions

### Starting the Game

- The game announces the starting number **N** and prompts **Player 1** for their move.

  ```
  Welcome to Divide and Conquer!
  Starting number (N) is 100.
  ```

### Player's Turn

1. **Display Current N and Prime Factors**:

   ```
   Player 1's turn:
   Current N: 100
   Prime factors of N: 2, 2, 5, 5
   ```

2. **Prompt for Input**:

   ```
   Choose a prime factor to divide N by:
   ```

3. **Handle Input**:

   - If the input is valid:

     ```
     You chose to divide by 2.
     N is now 50.
     ```

   - If the input is invalid:

     ```
     Invalid choice. Please select a valid prime factor of N.
     ```

### Ending the Game

- When a player cannot make a valid move:

  ```
  Player 1 has no valid moves remaining.
  Player 2 wins the game!
  ```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice affects the remaining prime factors.

- **Prime Factorization**: Familiarity with prime factors of common numbers can provide a strategic advantage.

- **Forcing Moves**: Try to force your opponent into positions where their options are limited.

- **Optimal Play**: Sometimes dividing by smaller primes extends the game, while larger primes can force a quicker end.

---

## Additional Rules

- **Agreement on Starting N**: Players may agree to start with a different **N** to adjust game length or difficulty.

- **Time Limits**: Optionally, players can set a time limit per turn to increase the challenge.

- **Rematches**: Players can play multiple rounds, keeping score of victories to determine an overall winner.

## Conclusion

Divide and Conquer is a strategic and educational game that tests your numerical reasoning and planning skills. By carefully selecting prime factors and anticipating your opponent's moves, you can outmaneuver them and claim victory.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
