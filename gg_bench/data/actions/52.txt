The action space indices directly represent potential divisors in the game, where each index corresponds to a possible divisor \(D\) such that \(2 \leq D < N\). An action chosen corresponds to selecting an index that represents a valid proper divisor to divide the current number \(N\). If a chosen action (index) is not a valid divisor (not within the proper range or doesn't divide \(N\) evenly), it results in an invalid move.
