# Switch Conquer: Rule Book

## Objective

**Switch Conquer** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to align all four switches to your designated state. Each player is assigned a state—either 'A' or 'B'—and must manipulate the switches to achieve a uniform configuration of their state. The first player to successfully set all switches to their state on their turn wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Players**: Two players are required. 
   - **Player 1** is assigned state **'A'**.
   - **Player 2** is assigned state **'B'**.

2. **Switches**: There are four switches arranged in a linear sequence. Each switch has two possible states:
   - **State 'A'**
   - **State 'B'**

3. **Initial Configuration**: The game starts with the switches in a random configuration of states 'A' and 'B'. For example:
   ```
   Switches: A B B A
   ```

---

## Game Components

- **Switches**: Represented as a sequence of four characters ('A' or 'B') indicating their current states. For example:
  ```
  A B A B
  ```

- **Player States**: Each player's designated state ('A' or 'B'). Players aim to change the switches to match their state.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Player 1 begins the game, and players alternate turns thereafter.

- **Actions per Turn**: On their turn, a player can perform one of the following actions:
  1. **Flip a Single Switch**: Change the state of any one switch.
  2. **Flip Two Adjacent Switches**: Change the states of any two switches that are next to each other.

- **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their action, the game checks for a win condition. If neither player has won, the turn passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Flipping a Switch**:
   - **Single Switch Flip**:
     - Select any one of the four switches.
     - Change its state from 'A' to 'B' or from 'B' to 'A'.
   - **Adjacent Switches Flip**:
     - Select any two switches that are adjacent (next to each other).
     - Change both of their states.

2. **Switch States**:
   - Switch states are always either 'A' or 'B'.
   - Flipping changes 'A' to 'B' and 'B' to 'A'.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Player 1 Wins**: When all switches are in state 'A' on Player 1's turn.
   - **Player 2 Wins**: When all switches are in state 'B' on Player 2's turn.
   - The win condition is checked at the end of each player's turn.

4. **No Draws**:
   - The game continues until one player wins.
   - Due to the finite number of switch configurations and the ability to always change states, the game cannot end in a draw.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: The game is won by the player who first aligns all switches to their designated state.
- **No Points System**: There is no point scoring system. The outcome is a win or loss based on achieving the objective.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your flips to counteract their strategy.
- **Control the Center**: Flipping the middle switches can be more impactful due to their adjacency to two other switches.
- **Force Moves**: Try to create configurations where your opponent has limited options to prevent them from aligning the switches to their state.
