In the gym environment for the "Sum Stack" game, the action space is a `Discrete(9)`, meaning it consists of integers from 0 to 8. Each action corresponds to selecting a number from 1 to 9 to add to the shared stack. The mapping is as follows: action index 0 maps to the number 1, action index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8 which maps to the number 9. This mapping allows players to select numbers by choosing the respective action index, where the action index is always one less than the number being chosen.
