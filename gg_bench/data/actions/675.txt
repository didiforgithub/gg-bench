The action space indices in the code map to the possible forward moves a player can make. Specifically:

- Action `0` corresponds to moving forward by `1` node.
- Action `1` corresponds to moving forward by `2` nodes.
- Action `2` corresponds to moving forward by `3` nodes.

These indices align with the action space defined using `spaces.Discrete(3)`, where each index represents a discrete choice of moving 1, 2, or 3 nodes forward on the game path.
