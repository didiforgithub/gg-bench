# Number Quest: A Strategic Grid Game

## Objective

**Number Quest** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid hides a unique number from 1 to 9. Players take turns selecting cells to reveal these numbers, aiming to reach a total score of **exactly 15**. The first player to accumulate a total score of **exactly 15** wins the game. However, if a player's total score exceeds 15 at any point, they **immediately lose**. The game requires careful planning and memory, allowing skilled players to consistently outperform unskilled opponents.

## Setup

1. **Grid Preparation**:
   - Create a 3x3 grid representing the game board.
   - Label the rows as 1 to 3 from top to bottom and the columns as 1 to 3 from left to right.
   - The cells are identified by their row and column numbers (e.g., cell (2,3) is in row 2, column 3).

2. **Number Assignment**:
   - Randomly shuffle the numbers from 1 to 9.
   - Assign one number to each cell in the grid, keeping them hidden from both players.

3. **Player Setup**:
   - Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2) by mutual agreement or a random method.
   - Both players start with a total score of **0**.

## Game Components

- **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid with hidden numbers in each cell.
- **Numbers**: Integers from 1 to 9, each used exactly once.
- **Player Scores**: Each player maintains a running total of the numbers they have revealed.
- **Markers**: Indicate which cells have been selected (can be as simple as an 'X' for selected cells).

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.

2. **Turn Actions**:
   - **Select a Cell**: On your turn, choose an unselected cell by specifying its row and column numbers.
   - **Reveal the Number**: Uncover the hidden number in the chosen cell.
   - **Update Score**: Add the revealed number to your total score.
   - **Mark the Cell**: Indicate that the cell has been selected to prevent it from being chosen again.

3. **End of Turn**:
   - Check for a winning or losing condition (reaching exactly 15 or exceeding 15).
   - If the game has not ended, pass the turn to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Cell Selection**:
   - Players can only select cells that have not been previously chosen.
   - Once a cell is selected, its number is revealed and cannot be selected again.

2. **Scoring**:
   - Players maintain their own total score, which is the sum of the numbers they have revealed.
   - The score is updated immediately after revealing a new number.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a total score of **exactly 15** wins the game.
   - If a player exceeds a total score of 15, they **immediately lose**, and the other player wins.

4. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Winning**: Achieving a score of exactly 15.
   - **Losing**: Exceeding a score of 15.
   - **No Possible Moves**: If all cells have been selected and no player has won or lost as per the above conditions, the player with the total score closest to 15 without exceeding it wins.
   - **Tie-Breaker**: If both players have the same total score closest to 15, the player who was last to play loses.

5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players should remember which numbers have been revealed to calculate probabilities and plan future moves.
   - It is crucial to avoid exceeding a total score of 15 while preventing the opponent from reaching exactly 15.

## Scoring

- **Player Total Score**: Sum of all numbers the player has revealed during the game.
- **Winning Score**: Exactly 15.
- **Losing Score**: Any total exceeding 15.
