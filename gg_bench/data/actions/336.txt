The action space indices in this game map to moves as follows:

- Index 0 represents a "pass" action, where the player chooses not to allocate any more energy units for their turn.
- Indices 1 to 75 represent energy allocations to nodes, structured in a grid like fashion. Specifically, each node can receive allocations ranging from 1 to 15 units of energy. The mapping is divided as:
  - Indices 1 to 15 map to allocating 1 to 15 units to Node 1.
  - Indices 16 to 30 map to allocating 1 to 15 units to Node 2.
  - Indices 31 to 45 map to allocating 1 to 15 units to Node 3.
  - Indices 46 to 60 map to allocating 1 to 15 units to Node 4.
  - Indices 61 to 75 map to allocating 1 to 15 units to Node 5.

Each of these mappings involves computing the particular node and the number of units allocated through integer division and modulus operations, respectively.
