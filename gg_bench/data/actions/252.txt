In the Bit Flip Duel environment, the action space indices directly map to the positions of bits in the players' sequences. The action space is defined with 5 discrete actions, representing the 5 available bit positions, indexed from 0 to 4. When a player selects an action (e.g., action 0), it corresponds to flipping the bit at that 0-indexed position (e.g., the leftmost bit) in both their own and their opponent's sequence.
