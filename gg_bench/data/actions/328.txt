The action space indices in the environment correspond directly to the numbers in the pool, which are ordered as an array: `[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Each index from 0 to 9 represents selecting the respective number from this list. For example, choosing action `0` selects `-5`, action `1` selects `-4`, and so on, up to action `9` which selects `5`. Each action causes the respective number to be removed from the pool and added to the current player's running total.
