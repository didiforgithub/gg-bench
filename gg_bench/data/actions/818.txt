In the `CustomEnv` for the **Sequence Splitter** game, the action space has been defined as `spaces.Discrete(15)`, meaning it allows integer actions from 0 to 14. During the partitioning phase, valid actions correspond to splitting positions where you can partition the sequence into two non-empty contiguous segments, so the valid indices range from 1 to the length of the current sequence minus 1. In the selecting phase, only actions 0 and 1 are valid, representing the choice to remove either the first or the second segment resulting from the previous partition.
