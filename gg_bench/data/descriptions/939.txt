# Countdown Clash

## Objective

**Countdown Clash** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to reduce a shared countdown number to exactly zero. On each turn, players subtract a prime number from a specified set from the shared number. The player who brings the countdown to zero wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move without causing the countdown to go negative, they lose.

## Setup

1. **Select the Starting Number (N):**
   - The game begins with a shared countdown number, **N**.
   - **N** should be a positive integer agreed upon by both players before the game starts. For a quick game, it's recommended to choose a number between 15 and 30.

2. **Determine Player Order:**
   - Decide which player goes first. This can be done by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Shared Countdown Number (N):**
  - A positive integer that both players will reduce with each turn.

- **Allowed Prime Numbers:**
  - The set of prime numbers that can be subtracted from **N** on each turn:
    - **2, 3, 5, 7**

## Turns

1. **Player Action:**
   - On their turn, a player must subtract one of the allowed prime numbers from the current value of **N**.

2. **Valid Moves:**
   - The chosen prime number must not reduce **N** below zero.
   - If no valid moves are available (all allowed primes are greater than **N**), the player loses.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - Players alternate turns until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Subtracting Primes:**
   - Players can only subtract from the list of allowed prime numbers: **2, 3, 5, 7**.

2. **Updating the Countdown:**
   - After a player subtracts a prime number, **N** is updated to reflect the new value (N = N - prime number).

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player who reduces **N** to exactly zero wins the game.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - A player loses if:
     - They cannot make a valid move on their turn (no allowed primes can be subtracted without making **N** negative).
     - They reduce **N** to a negative number (an invalid move).

5. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If a player has at least one valid move, they must make a move.

## Scoring

- **Winning:**
  - The winner is the player who successfully reduces **N** to zero or forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves.

- **Tracking Wins:**
  - Players can track the number of games won if playing multiple rounds.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Number (N):** 23

**Turn Sequence:**

1. **Player 1's Turn (N = 23):**
   - Player 1 subtracts **5**.
   - **N** is now **18** (23 - 5).

2. **Player 2's Turn (N = 18):**
   - Player 2 subtracts **7**.
   - **N** is now **11** (18 - 7).

3. **Player 1's Turn (N = 11):**
   - Player 1 subtracts **5**.
   - **N** is now **6** (11 - 5).

4. **Player 2's Turn (N = 6):**
   - Player 2 subtracts **2**.
   - **N** is now **4** (6 - 2).

5. **Player 1's Turn (N = 4):**
   - Player 1 subtracts **2**.
   - **N** is now **2** (4 - 2).

6. **Player 2's Turn (N = 2):**
   - Player 2 subtracts **2**.
   - **N** is now **0** (2 - 2).
   - **Player 2 wins**.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Game Start: N = 23

Player 1's turn.
Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7
N = 23
Enter the prime number to subtract: 5
N is now 18

Player 2's turn.
Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7
N = 18
Enter the prime number to subtract: 7
N is now 11

Player 1's turn.
Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7
N = 11
Enter the prime number to subtract: 5
N is now 6

Player 2's turn.
Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7
N = 6
Enter the prime number to subtract: 2
N is now 4

Player 1's turn.
Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7
N = 4
Enter the prime number to subtract: 2
N is now 2

Player 2's turn.
Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7
N = 2
Enter the prime number to subtract: 2
N is now 0

Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Planning Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the results of your move and how it will affect your opponent's options.
  
- **Controlling the Game:**
  - Try to leave **N** in a state where the opponent has limited choices, potentially forcing them into a losing position.
  
- **Prime Selection:**
  - Use higher primes early to reduce **N** quickly, but be cautious of the remaining options as **N** decreases.

## Game Variations

- **Changing Allowed Primes:**
  - Modify the list of allowed primes to adjust game difficulty (e.g., use only 2, 3, and 5).

- **Different Starting Number:**
  - Start with a higher **N** for a longer game or a lower **N** for a quicker game.

- **Additional Primes:**
  - Include more prime numbers (e.g., 11, 13) to add complexity.

## Summary

**Countdown Clash** is a simple yet strategic game that requires foresight and planning. It's easy to implement in a command-line interface and provides a quick and competitive experience. By understanding the game's mechanics and carefully selecting which prime numbers to subtract, a skilled player can consistently triumph over their opponent.

Have fun clashing!
