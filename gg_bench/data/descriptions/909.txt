# Number Reach: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the **target number** exactly by strategically applying allowed mathematical operations to the **shared current number**. Careful planning and foresight are essential, as exceeding the target number results in an immediate loss.

## Setup

1. **Determine the Target Number**: Agree on a target number to reach. For a quick game, a number between 15 and 31 is recommended (e.g., **23**).
2. **Initialize the Game**: Set the **current number** to **1**.
3. **Assign Operation Limits**: Each player has a limited number of times they can use each allowed operation:
   - **Add 1**: Up to **5** times per player.
   - **Multiply by 2**: Up to **4** times per player.
4. **Decide the Turn Order**: Choose who goes first (coin toss, mutual agreement, etc.).

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that starts at **1** and changes based on players' moves.
- **Target Number**: The agreed-upon number that players aim to reach exactly.
- **Operations**:
  - **Add 1** (`+1`): Increases the current number by 1.
  - **Multiply by 2** (`*2`): Multiplies the current number by 2.
- **Operation Limits**:
  - Each player can use **Add 1** up to **5 times**.
  - Each player can use **Multiply by 2** up to **4 times**.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input commands to perform operations during their turns.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Information**: At the start of each turn, display the current number, remaining operation counts for both players, and the target number.
  2. **Player Action**: The current player chooses one allowed operation to apply to the current number.
  3. **Validation**: The game checks if the operation is valid (operation limits and not exceeding the target number).
  4. **Update State**: Apply the operation, update the current number, and decrement the player's operation count for that operation.
  5. **Turn Progression**: The turn passes to the other player.

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Allowed Operations**: On your turn, you must choose one of the following operations to apply to the current number:
   - **Add 1** (`+1`): Increases the current number by 1.
   - **Multiply by 2** (`*2`): Multiplies the current number by 2.

2. **Operation Limits**:
   - **Add 1**: Can be used up to **5 times per player**.
   - **Multiply by 2**: Can be used up to **4 times per player**.

3. **Applying Operations**:
   - The chosen operation is applied to the current number to produce a new current number.
   - **Example**: If the current number is 6 and you choose `*2`, the new current number is 12.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Exact Match**: If your operation brings the current number to **exactly match the target number**, you win.
   - **Exceeding the Target**: If your operation causes the current number to **exceed the target number**, you lose immediately.
   
5. **Valid Moves**:
   - You cannot perform an operation if you have exhausted its usage limit.
   - You cannot make a move that would cause the current number to exceed the target number.

6. **Draws**: There are no draw conditions in this game.

7. **Running Out of Operations**:
   - If both players run out of allowed operations without reaching the target number, the **last player to make a valid move wins**.

8. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends when one player wins or loses according to the rules above.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who reaches the target number exactly wins the game.
- **Defeat**: A player loses if:
  - They apply an operation that causes the current number to exceed the target number.
  - They have no valid operations left, and it's their turn to play.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the structure of the rules.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of both your and your opponent's remaining operations.
- **Operation Limits**: Use your multiplication operations wisely; they have a greater impact but are limited.
