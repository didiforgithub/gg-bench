In the gym environment for Divisor Duel, each action space index corresponds to a divisor of the current number \( N \). The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.initial_N)`, meaning it represents a range of integers from 0 to `initial_N - 1`. Each index \( a \) in this action space maps directly to a potential divisor of \( N \) by using the formula \( \text{divisor} = a + 1 \). This means action index 0 maps to divisor 1, index 1 maps to divisor 2, and so on, up to the maximum possible divisor of `initial_N`. Only valid action indices, which correspond to actual divisors of \( N \), result in legitimate moves within the game.
