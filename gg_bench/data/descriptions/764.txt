# Factor Fury: A Strategic Number Game

## Objective

Be the first player to accumulate **15 points** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool and leveraging their unique prime factors. Outscore your opponent by carefully choosing numbers that maximize your point gain while limiting their options.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization**:
   - Create a shared pool containing integers from **2 to 50** inclusive.
   - Ensure all numbers are available at the start of the game.

2. **Player Roles**:
   - This is a **two-player game**. Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Players may choose their designation randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Set both players' scores to **zero**.
   - Determine who takes the first turn (e.g., by a coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**:
  - A list of integers from **2 to 50**.
  - Numbers can be selected only once during the game.

- **Player Scores**:
  - Each player has a score that starts at **zero**.
  - Scores increase based on the prime factors of the selected numbers.

- **Prime Numbers**:
  - Fundamental to scoring. The unique prime factors of selected numbers determine point gains.
  - Prime numbers between 2 and 47 (the largest prime under 50) are integral to the game.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns, starting with the designated first player.

- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Select a Number**:
     - Choose any available number from the number pool.
     - Numbers already chosen by either player cannot be selected again.
  2. **Score Calculation**:
     - Identify the **unique prime factors** of the selected number.
     - Add the count of these prime factors to your score.
  3. **Update the Number Pool**:
     - Remove the selected number from the pool.
  4. **Announce Turn Results**:
     - Reveal the selected number, its prime factors, and the updated scores.
  5. **Check for Victory**:
     - If a player reaches or exceeds **15 points**, the game ends with that player’s victory.
     - If not, the next player takes their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection Rules**:
   - Only numbers from **2 to 50** can be selected.
   - Each number can be chosen **only once**.
   - Players must select a number on their turn; skipping a turn is not allowed.

2. **Scoring Mechanics**:
   - **Points per Turn**:
     - Points gained per turn equal the count of **unique prime factors** of the selected number.
   - **Prime Factorization**:
     - Break down the selected number into its prime factors.
     - Only **unique** primes count towards the score, regardless of their multiplicity.
     - For example:
       - Selecting **18** (prime factors 2 and 3) grants **2 points**.
       - Selecting **16** (prime factor 2) grants **1 point**.
       - Selecting a prime number like **13** grants **1 point**.

3. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Maximize Points**:
     - Aim to select numbers with the highest number of unique prime factors.
   - **Deny Opponent**:
     - Anticipate and select numbers that your opponent might use to gain high points.
   - **Prime Numbers**:
     - Remember that prime numbers only grant **1 point**.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach or exceed **15 points** at the end of their turn wins.
   - If both players reach 15 points in the same round, the player with the higher score wins.
   - In the unlikely event of a tie, continue playing until the tie is broken.

## Scoring

- **Point Calculation Example**:
  - **Number Selected**: 30
  - **Prime Factors**: 2, 3, 5 (since 30 = 2 × 3 × 5)
  - **Points Gained**: 3
  - **Updated Score**: Add points gained to the player's existing score.

- **Tracking Scores**:
  - Keep a running total of each player's score after every turn.
  - Ensure transparency by announcing updated scores after each move.

Enter your chosen number: 30
You selected 30.
Prime factors: 2, 3, 5
Points gained: 3
Alice's Score: 3
```

**Turn 2**:
```
Bob's Turn:
Available Numbers: 2-29, 31-50
Enter your chosen number: 42
You selected 42.
Prime factors: 2, 3, 7

Bob's Score: 3
```

**Turn 3**:
```

## Additional Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Look at the available numbers and their prime factors.
  - Choose numbers that maximize your points while minimizing high-value options for your opponent.

- **Prime Awareness**:
  - Be mindful of prime numbers left in the pool. They grant only 1 point but can be used strategically.

- **Avoid Helping Opponent**:
  - Try not to leave numbers with many unique prime factors available for your opponent's next turn.

## Conclusion

Factor Fury combines basic number theory with strategic planning, offering a simple yet engaging experience. By selecting numbers wisely and anticipating your opponent's moves, you can outscore them and claim victory. Enjoy the challenge of blending arithmetic with cunning strategy!
