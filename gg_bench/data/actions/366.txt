In the game environment, the action space is indexed from 0 to 24, representing each cell in the 5x5 grid linearly. An action corresponds to selecting a specific cell by calculating its row and column position with integer division and modulo operations. Specifically, for a given action `a`, the row is `a // 5` and the column is `a % 5`. This directly translates the linear index to the intended cell in the grid, allowing for efficient move selection.
