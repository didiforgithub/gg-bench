# Divisor Duel: A Strategic Two-Player Number Game

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the **Current Number** to exactly **zero** by strategically subtracting its proper divisors.

- **Victory**: You win if you reduce the Current Number to zero on your turn.
- **Loss**: You lose if your opponent reduces the Current Number to zero before you.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared **Current Number** of **20**. Players can agree to start with a different positive integer for varied difficulty.
2. **Player Assignment**: Determine who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. You can flip a coin or choose randomly.
3. **Game Interface**: The game is played in a command-line interface, where players enter their moves when prompted.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: An integer that starts at **20** and changes as players subtract numbers.
- **Proper Divisors**: Numbers that evenly divide the Current Number excluding 1 and the number itself.
  - For example, proper divisors of 8 are **2** and **4**.
- **Prime Number Identifier**: Recognizes when the Current Number is prime.

---

## Turns

- **Alternate Turns**: Players take turns one after the other, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Current Number**: The game shows the Current Number.
  2. **List Proper Divisors**: The game lists available proper divisors for the Current Number.
  3. **Player Action**: The current player chooses a number to subtract according to the rules.
  4. **Update Number**: The chosen number is subtracted from the Current Number.
  5. **Check for Win**: If the Current Number reaches zero, the player who made the last move wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Subtracting Proper Divisors**:
   - On your turn, you **must** subtract a proper divisor of the Current Number.
   - **Proper Divisors** exclude **1** and the number itself.
   - If the Current Number is **4**, valid options are **2** (since 2 divides 4 evenly).

2. **Handling Prime Numbers**:
   - If the Current Number is **prime** (no proper divisors), you **must** subtract **1**.
   - For example, if the Current Number is **13**, you can only subtract **1**.

3. **No Proper Divisors**:
   - If the Current Number has no proper divisors (excluding 1 and itself), you **must** subtract **1**.
   - This applies to numbers like **1** and **prime numbers**.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - You cannot subtract **1** unless the Current Number is prime or has no proper divisors.
   - You cannot subtract a number that's not a proper divisor of the Current Number.
   - Making an invalid move forfeits your turn (optional rule for added competitiveness).

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - You win if you reduce the Current Number to **exactly zero** on your turn.
   - If you cannot make a valid move when the Current Number is greater than zero, you lose.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: First player to reduce the Current Number to zero wins.
- **No Points System**: The game doesn't track points; it's a win-or-lose outcome.
- **Match Play**: Players can decide to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins.

Enter a number to subtract: 5

Player 1 subtracts 5.
New Current Number: 15

Player 2's Turn
Current Number: 15
Proper Divisors: 3, 5
Enter a number to subtract: 5

Player 2 subtracts 5.
New Current Number: 10

Player 1's Turn
Current Number: 10
Proper Divisors: 2, 5
Enter a number to subtract: 5

Player 1 subtracts 5.
New Current Number: 5

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves by calculating potential future Current Numbers.
- **Control the Primes**: Force the Current Number into a prime on your opponent's turn, limiting their options.
- **Balance Subtractions**: Sometimes subtracting a smaller proper divisor can set up a win in subsequent turns.
- **Avoid Invalid Moves**: Always ensure the number you subtract is a proper divisor to avoid losing a turn.

---

## Additional Rules (Optional for Advanced Play)

- **Forfeit Rule**: An invalid move results in an immediate loss.
- **Time Limit**: Players have a set amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds) per turn to make their move.
- **Variable Starting Number**: Agree on different starting numbers to increase difficulty. Larger numbers make the game longer and potentially more complex.

## Conclusion

Divisor Duel is an engaging and strategic game that combines simple arithmetic with tactical planning. It's easy to learn and quick to play, making it ideal for a fun challenge between friends or as a programming project to implement. Mastery comes from understanding the properties of numbers and anticipating your opponent's moves.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
