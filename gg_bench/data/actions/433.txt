In the gym environment for the "Number Bid" game, the action space is discrete with indices ranging from 0 to 9. Each index corresponds to a move where the player bids a number from the available pool. Specifically, each action index `i` represents the bid of number `i + 1`, where `i` is an index from the action space. For example, action index 0 corresponds to bidding the number 1, and action index 9 corresponds to bidding the number 10.
