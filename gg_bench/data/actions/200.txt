In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as `Discrete(self.Max_N - 1)`, which means the valid action indices range from `0` to `self.Max_N - 2`. Each action index represents a potential divisor that the player can subtract from the current value of `N`. Specifically, an action index `a` corresponds to the divisor `a + 1`. This mapping accounts for the fact that gym action spaces typically start from zero, whereas proper divisors are positive integers starting from one. Therefore, selecting action index `a` will attempt to subtract the divisor `a + 1` from `N`.
