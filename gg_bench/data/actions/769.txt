In the CustomEnv class, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(8)`, which represents the indices 0 to 7. These indices are mapped to the game multipliers from 2 to 9. The mapping is simple: index 0 corresponds to multiplier 2, index 1 corresponds to multiplier 3, and so on, up to index 7 which corresponds to multiplier 9. Thus, the action index `i` maps to the multiplier `i + 2`.
