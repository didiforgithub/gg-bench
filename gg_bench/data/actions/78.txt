In the game, the action space consists of 50 discrete actions, divided into two types:

1. **Move Actions (0-24)**: These actions correspond to moving a player's piece to a specific cell on the grid. The action index directly maps to a grid position:
   - Index 0 to 24 represent grid positions (Row 1 to 5, Column 1 to 5).
   - For any move action index `n`, the corresponding target cell is `(n // 5, n % 5)`.

2. **Block Actions (25-49)**: These actions correspond to placing a block on the grid. The action index maps in the same manner as move actions, but the index starts from 25:
   - Index 25 to 49 represent block placement possibilities on the grid positions (Row 1 to 5, Column 1 to 5).
   - For a block action index `m`, the corresponding target cell is `((m - 25) // 5, (m - 25) % 5)`.
