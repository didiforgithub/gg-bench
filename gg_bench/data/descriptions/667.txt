# Number Morph: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

**Number Morph** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players manipulate a shared three-digit number. The primary goal is to be the last player to produce a valid number according to the game's rules. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Setup

- **Initial Number**: The game starts with a randomly selected three-digit number that meets the initial validity criteria (see Rules and Mechanics).
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss). Turns alternate between the players throughout the game.
- **History Log**: An empty list to keep track of all numbers used during the game to prevent repeats.

## Game Components

- **Three-Digit Number**: The core element of the game, which players alter on their turns.
- **Digits (0-9)**: Players can manipulate individual digits within the number.
- **Positions**: Each digit in the three-digit number has a position â€” hundreds (leftmost), tens (middle), and units (rightmost).
- **History Log**: A record of all previously used numbers to ensure no repeats.

## Turns

- **Action**: On their turn, a player must change exactly one digit of the current three-digit number to create a new valid number.
- **Digit Selection**: The player chooses one position (hundreds, tens, or units) and replaces the digit in that position with a different digit from 0-9.
- **Validity Check**: The new number must satisfy all the rules specified in the Rules and Mechanics section.
- **Logging**: The new valid number is added to the History Log.
- **Passing Turn**: After a successful move, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Single-Digit Change**: Players can change only one digit per turn.
2. **Digit Positions**:
   - **Hundreds Place**: Can be any digit from 1-9 (cannot be 0; leading zeros are not allowed).
   - **Tens and Units Places**: Can be any digit from 0-9.
3. **Valid Numbers**:
   - The new number must be a **prime number**.
   - The number must be **odd** (since all primes except 2 are odd, and 2 cannot be a three-digit number).
   - The number must not have been previously used in the game (no repeats).
4. **Restrictions**:
   - Players cannot rearrange digits; only a single-digit substitution is allowed.
   - Changing a digit to the same digit (no change) is not permitted.
5. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if they create a valid number that leaves the opponent with no valid moves on their subsequent turn.
   - A player loses if they cannot produce a valid number on their turn.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Condition**: The game is a zero-sum game with no points system. The outcome is a win for one player and a loss for the other.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite number of valid primes and the no-repeat rule.

- **New Number**: **271**
- **Validity Check**: 271 is prime but already used.
- **Attempt 4**: Changes the units digit from **7** to **9**
- **New Number**: **279**
- **Validity Check**: 279 is not prime.
- **Attempt 5**: Changes the tens digit from **7** to **9**

- **Unable to Find Valid Move**: Player 1 cannot make a valid move.
- **Game Ends**: Player 2 wins.

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

**Starting the Game**:

```
Welcome to Number Morph!
Starting number is: 211

Enter the position to change (hundreds/tens/units): units
Enter the new digit (0-9): 7
New number formed: 277
277 is a prime number. Turn complete.
```

**Turn 3**: Player 1

```
Current number: 277
Enter the position to change (hundreds/tens/units): hundreds
