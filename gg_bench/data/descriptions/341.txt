# Energy Capture

## Objective

Become the first player to accumulate a total energy score of **15 or more** by capturing Energy Cells scattered across a 5x5 grid. Strategically navigate the grid to collect Energy Cells while blocking your opponent from doing the same.

---

## Setup

1. **Grid Initialization**:
   - The game is played on a **5x5 grid** with cells labeled by their coordinates `(row, column)`, ranging from `(1,1)` in the top-left corner to `(5,5)` in the bottom-right corner.

2. **Player Positions**:
   - **Player 1** starts at the **top-left corner** at position `(1,1)`.
   - **Player 2** starts at the **bottom-right corner** at position `(5,5)`.

3. **Energy Cells Placement**:
   - A total of **8 Energy Cells** are randomly placed on the grid at the beginning of the game.
   - Energy Cells have random energy values ranging from **1 to 5**.
   - Energy Cells cannot be placed on the starting positions `(1,1)` or `(5,5)` or occupy the same cell.
   - Each Energy Cell's position and energy value are visible to both players.

4. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Both players begin with an energy score of **0**.
   - Players cannot occupy the same cell at any time.

## Game Components

1. **Grid Cells**:
   - **Empty Cells**: Cells with no Energy Cells or player markers.
   - **Energy Cells**: Contain an energy value (**1-5**). Represented as `E[value]` (e.g., `E3` for an energy value of 3).
   - **Player Markers**: Indicate the current position of each player on the grid. Represented as `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2.

2. **Players**:
   - Each player controls a single marker on the grid.
   - Players can move their marker to collect Energy Cells.

3. **Energy Score**:
   - A tally of the energy values from captured Energy Cells.
   - The objective is to reach an energy score of **15 or more**.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Movement**:
     - Move your marker to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).
     - Diagonal movements are **not** allowed.
     - You **cannot** move onto a cell occupied by the opponent's marker.
     - You **cannot** revisit a cell you have previously occupied during the game.

   - **Capturing Energy Cells**:
     - If you move onto a cell containing an Energy Cell, you immediately capture it.
     - Add the Energy Cell's value to your energy score.
     - Remove the Energy Cell from the grid.

   - **Blocking**:
     - While you cannot occupy the same cell as your opponent, you can position yourself to block their path to an Energy Cell.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After completing your movement and any applicable actions (like capturing an Energy Cell), your turn ends.
   - The opponent then begins their turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Restrictions**:
   - **Adjacent Cells Only**: You can only move to cells directly next to your current position (no skipping cells).
   - **No Revisiting Cells**: Once you have moved away from a cell, you cannot return to it later in the game.
   - **Opponent's Cell**: You cannot move into the cell occupied by your opponent.

2. **Energy Cells**:
   - **Visibility**: All Energy Cells and their values are visible to both players at all times.
   - **Capture**: Moving onto a cell with an Energy Cell automatically captures it.
   - **Removal**: Once captured, the Energy Cell is removed from the grid.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Victory Condition**: The first player to reach an energy score of **15 or more** wins immediately.
   - **No Draws**: The game continues until one player achieves the victory condition.

4. **Adjacent Energy Cells**:
   - If both players are adjacent to the same Energy Cell, the player whose turn it is can capture it during their turn.

5. **Energy Score Tie**:
   - If both players exceed an energy score of 15 on the same turn, the player with the **higher energy score** wins.
   - If tied, the player who captured the most Energy Cells wins.
   - If still tied, the player who captured the highest value Energy Cell wins.

## Scoring

- **Energy Score Tracking**:
  - Keep a running total of your energy score after each capture.
  - Example: If you first capture an Energy Cell with value 4, your energy score is now 4.

- **Victory Threshold**:
  - Aim to accumulate an energy score of **15 or more** as quickly as possible.
