In the gym environment for Zero Sum Duel, the action space is represented by discrete indices 0 to 4. These indices map directly to subtraction numbers 1 through 5 used in the game. Specifically, the mapping is as follows:

- Action index 0 corresponds to the subtraction number 1.
- Action index 1 corresponds to the subtraction number 2.
- Action index 2 corresponds to the subtraction number 3.
- Action index 3 corresponds to the subtraction number 4.
- Action index 4 corresponds to the subtraction number 5.

This mapping allows players to choose their move by selecting an action index, which is then translated into the corresponding number they wish to subtract from their score.
