The action space indices in the gym environment correspond to a predefined array of prime numbers. Specifically, each index in the `self.primes` array maps directly to a prime number, which represents a possible move in the game. When a player selects an action index, the environment translates that selection into the corresponding prime number, which is then used to attempt a division on the current value of **N**. If **N** is divisible by the selected prime, this move is valid; otherwise, it is invalid. Each index-action thus maps deterministically to a prime factor used to manipulate the shared integer **N**.
