**Multiplication Showdown**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to reach or exceed the target number of **100** by sequentially multiplying a shared current number by integers between **2** and **9** on your turn.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a **current number** set to **1**.
2. **Players**: Two players decide who will go first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Current Number**: A shared number that starts at **1** and changes based on player actions.
- **Target Number**: **100**. The goal is to reach or exceed this number.
- **Allowed Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   
2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:

   - **Choose a Multiplier**: Select an integer between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - **Multiply**: Multiply the **current number** by the chosen multiplier.
   - **Update Current Number**: The result becomes the new **current number**.

3. **Turn Progression**: After updating the current number, the turn passes to the other player.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Allowed Multipliers**: On each turn, you must choose an integer between **2** and **9**.

2. **Updating the Current Number**:

   - Multiply the existing **current number** by the chosen multiplier.
   - Example: If the current number is **3** and you choose **4**, the new current number is **12** (3 × 4).

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - **Victory Condition**: The player whose action causes the current number to **reach or exceed 100** wins the game.
   - **Exact Match Not Required**: Exceeding 100 is acceptable for winning.

4. **Invalid Moves**:

   - **Exceeding Number Before 100**: There is no penalty for causing the current number to exceed 100; the player still wins.
   - **Invalid Multiplier**: Choosing a multiplier outside the range **2** to **9** is not allowed. If attempted, the player must reselect.

5. **Strategy Note**:

   - Players should plan ahead to force their opponent into a losing position by careful selection of multipliers.

### **Scoring**

- **Winning**: The winner is the player who reaches or surpasses the target number of **100**.
- **No Points System**: There are no points; the game is won by meeting the victory condition.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Starting the Game**

- The current number is **1**.

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- Chooses multiplier **5**.
- Calculation: 1 × 5 = **5**.
- New current number: **5**.

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- Chooses multiplier **9**.
- Calculation: 5 × 9 = **45**.
- New current number: **45**.

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- Chooses multiplier **2**.
- Calculation: 45 × 2 = **90**.
- New current number: **90**.

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- Chooses multiplier **2**.
- Calculation: 90 × 2 = **180**.
- New current number: **180**.

- Since the current number **180** has exceeded **100**, **Player 2 wins**.

---

#### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

Assuming a simple command-line interface where players input their chosen multiplier.

**Game Start**

- `Current number: 1`
- `Player 1, enter your multiplier (2-9):`

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- Player 1 inputs: `5`
- Output:
  - `Player 1 multiplies by 5.`
  - `New current number is 5.`

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- `Current number: 5`
- `Player 2, enter your multiplier (2-9):`
- Player 2 inputs: `9`
- Output:
  - `Player 2 multiplies by 9.`
  - `New current number is 45.`

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- `Current number: 45`
- `Player 1, enter your multiplier (2-9):`
- Player 1 inputs: `2`
- Output:
  - `Player 1 multiplies by 2.`
  - `New current number is 90.`

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- `Current number: 90`
- `Player 2, enter your multiplier (2-9):`
- Player 2 inputs: `2`
- Output:
  - `Player 2 multiplies by 2.`
  - `New current number is 180.`
  - `Player 2 has reached or exceeded 100 and wins the game!`

### **Additional Notes**

- **Strategic Depth**:

  - Players can develop strategies to force their opponent into a position where they cannot prevent the current number from reaching 100 on the next turn.
  - Understanding multiplication and factors of the current number enhances gameplay.

- **Game Length**:

  - The game is designed to be quick, typically concluding within a few turns.

- **Skill Factor**:

  - A skilled player who thinks ahead and calculates possible outcomes can consistently beat an unskilled player.
