# Deca Sum: A Two-Player Turn-Based Number Strategy Game

## Objective

**Deca Sum** is a strategic two-player game where the goal is to be the first player to accumulate a total sum of numbers that is a multiple of 10 (i.e., 10, 20, or 30). Players achieve victory by carefully selecting numbers from a shared pool and summing them to reach the target total before their opponent.

- **Win Condition**: The first player to reach a total sum exactly divisible by 10 wins the game.
- **Loss Condition**: If a player cannot make a move (no numbers remain), and neither player has achieved a total sum divisible by 10, the player with the total closest to a multiple of 10 without exceeding it wins.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool**: A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9** is available for both players.
2. **Player Scores**: Each player starts with an initial score of **0**.
3. **First Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: Digits from **1** to **9**, represented as a list or array.
- **Player Score**: A running total of numbers selected by each player.
- **Game Interface**: Command-line prompts and inputs for player actions.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the first player decided during setup.
2. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player selects an available number from the shared number pool.
3. **Updating Scores**: The selected number is added to the player's total score.
4. **Number Removal**: Once a number is selected, it is removed from the number pool and cannot be selected again.
5. **End of Turn**: The turn ends after the player updates their score and the number pool is adjusted.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Number Selection**:
  - Players can only select numbers that are currently available in the number pool.
  - Each number from **1** to **9** can be selected only once during the game.

- **Scoring**:
  - A player's total score is the sum of all numbers they have selected.
  - Scores are updated immediately after each selection.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - If a player's total score becomes exactly **10**, **20**, or **30** after their turn, they win the game immediately.
  
- **Game End Without Immediate Win**:
  - If all numbers have been selected and neither player has a total score divisible by **10**, the game ends.
  - The player with the total score closest to a multiple of **10** without exceeding it wins.
  - If both players are equally close, the last player to have taken a turn wins.

- **Strategic Considerations**:
  - Players must anticipate the opponent's possible moves and plan accordingly.
  - Choosing numbers not only to advance one's own score but also to block the opponent is key.

## Scoring

- **Player Total Score**: Sum of all numbers selected by the player.
- **Winning Score**: A total score of **10**, **20**, or **30**.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  - If both players have the same total score after all numbers are selected, the last player to have taken a turn wins.

## Strategy Tips

- **Monitor Totals**: Keep track of both your total and your opponent's total to anticipate possible winning moves.
- **Control Key Numbers**: Be aware of numbers that can help you reach multiples of 10 and try to select them before your opponent.
- **Block Opponent**: If you can't reach a multiple of 10 in your next move, consider selecting numbers that prevent your opponent from doing so.
- **Plan Ahead**: Think several moves ahead to set up your path to victory.
