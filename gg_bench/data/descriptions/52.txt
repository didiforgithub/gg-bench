# Divide and Conquer: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divide and Conquer** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where the primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared starting number to exactly **1** on their turn using division rules. Players take turns dividing the current number by its proper divisors, aiming to force their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Mastery of the game's mechanics and foresight in planning moves will enable skilled players to consistently outmaneuver their opponents and achieve victory.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Decide on a positive integer **N** to serve as the starting number for the game. This number should be greater than **1**. For a standard game, **N = 100** is recommended for balanced gameplay.
2. **Player Order**: Determine which player will make the first move. This can be decided by mutual agreement or by a random method such as flipping a coin.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: The central element of the game is a shared positive integer **N** that changes as players make their moves.
  - **Initial Value**: Set to the agreed-upon starting number (e.g., **100**).
  - **Current Value**: Updated after each player's turn to reflect the result of their division.
- **Proper Divisors**: The set of integers that can exactly divide **N** (excluding **1** and **N** itself). These are used by players to make valid moves.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - **Player 1** makes the first move, followed by **Player 2**, and so on.
2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Identify Valid Divisors**: The player examines the current **N** to determine its proper divisors (excluding **1** and **N**).
   - **Select a Divisor**: The player chooses one proper divisor **D** to divide **N**.
   - **Calculate New N**: The player computes the new value of **N** by dividing it by **D** (**N = N ÷ D**).
   - **Announce Move**: The player announces the chosen divisor and the new value of **N**.
3. **Progression of Turns**:
   - The updated **N** becomes the starting value for the next player's turn.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On their turn, a player **must** divide **N** by one of its proper divisors (**D**), where **1 < D < N** and **N mod D = 0**.
   - Proper divisors are integers greater than **1** and less than **N** that divide **N** without leaving a remainder.
2. **Invalid Moves**:
   - A move is invalid if:
     - The player attempts to divide by **1** or **N**.
     - The chosen divisor does not divide **N** exactly (remainder is not zero).
     - The player selects a number not within the proper divisors of **N**.
3. **Forcing a Win**:
   - A player cannot skip their turn or pass; they must make a valid move if one exists.
   - If **N** is a prime number (it has no proper divisors), or if **N** equals **1** at the start of a player's turn, the player loses because they cannot make a valid move.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces **N** to exactly **1** on their turn by making a valid division wins the game.
   - Alternatively, if a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose, and the opponent wins.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: The winner is the player who successfully reduces **N** to **1** on their turn by making a valid move.
- **Loss Condition**: A player loses if:
  - They cannot make a valid move on their turn because **N** is **1** or a prime number.
  - They attempt to make an invalid move (violating the division rules).

No points are tracked beyond determining the winner and the loser of the game. Each game is a standalone event where strategic play leads directly to victory or defeat.

## Examples

### Example 1: Starting with N = 100

**Setup**:
- Starting Number (**N**): 100
- Player 1 begins.

**Game Play**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 100
   - **Proper Divisors of 100**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
   - **Player 1 Chooses D = 50**:
     - **Calculation**: N = 100 ÷ 50 = 2
     - **Announcement**: "I divide 100 by 50; the new N is 2."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 2
   - **Proper Divisors of 2**: None (2 is prime)
   - **Result**: Player 2 cannot make a valid move and loses.
   - **Winner**: Player 1

**Conclusion**: Player 1 wins by reducing N to a prime number on Player 2's turn, leaving no valid moves.

### Example 2: Starting with N = 30

**Setup**:
- Starting Number (**N**): 30
- Player 1 begins.

**Game Play**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 30
   - **Proper Divisors of 30**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
   - **Player 1 Chooses D = 2**:
     - **Calculation**: N = 30 ÷ 2 = 15
     - **Announcement**: "I divide 30 by 2; the new N is 15."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 15
   - **Proper Divisors of 15**: 3, 5
   - **Player 2 Chooses D = 5**:
     - **Calculation**: N = 15 ÷ 5 = 3
     - **Announcement**: "I divide 15 by 5; the new N is 3."

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 3
   - **Proper Divisors of 3**: None (3 is prime)
   - **Result**: Player 1 cannot make a valid move and loses.
   - **Winner**: Player 2

**Conclusion**: Player 2 wins by leaving Player 1 with a prime number with no valid moves.

**Conclusion**: Player 1 uses a strategic move to reduce N to a prime number, forcing a win.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample interaction illustrating how the game might be played in a command-line interface.

### Sample Game: Starting with N = 36

**Game Start**:
- **N**: 36
- **Player 1** begins.

**Player 1's Turn**:
```
Current N is 36.
Proper divisors are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18
Enter your chosen divisor: 18
You divided 36 by 18. New N is 2.
```

**Player 2's Turn**:
```
Current N is 2.
No valid moves available. 2 is a prime number.
Player 2 cannot make a move and loses.
```

**Outcome**:
- **Winner**: Player 1

### Alternative Scenario

If **Player 1** makes a less strategic move:

**Player 1's Turn**:
```
Current N is 36.
Proper divisors are: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18
Enter your chosen divisor: 2
You divided 36 by 2. New N is 18.
```

**Player 2's Turn**:
```
Current N is 18.
Proper divisors are: 2, 3, 6, 9
Enter your chosen divisor: 9
You divided 18 by 9. New N is 2.
```

**Player 1's Turn**:
```
Current N is 2.
No valid moves available. 2 is a prime number.
Player 1 cannot make a move and loses.
```

**Outcome**:
- **Winner**: Player 2

**Conclusion**: Making strategic choices is crucial. Selecting divisors that leave the opponent with a prime number or **N = 1** can secure a win.
