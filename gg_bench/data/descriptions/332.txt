### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the results of both addition and multiplication to avoid exceeding the target number.
  
- **Control the Pace:**
  - Use addition to fine-tune the current number when close to the target.
  
- **Force Errors:**
  - Try to put your opponent in a position where any move they make will cause them to exceed the target number.

- **Operation Choice:**
  - Early in the game, multiplication can quickly increase the current number.
  - As you approach the target number, addition may be safer.

---

### **Variations**

- **Changing Operations:**
  - Add more operations, such as subtracting a number or multiplying by different values, to increase complexity.

- **Different Target Numbers:**
  - Set higher or lower target numbers for shorter or longer games.
