The action space in the gym environment is represented by `Discrete(10)`, meaning actions are indexed from 0 to 9. Each index corresponds to a move in the game where a player chooses a number from 1 to 10. Specifically, action index `i` maps to the move of selecting the number `i + 1`. For example, an action of 0 represents choosing the number 1, and an action of 9 represents choosing the number 10.
