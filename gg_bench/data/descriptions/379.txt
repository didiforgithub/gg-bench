# Dueling Wizards

## Objective

Become the last wizard standing by strategically using spells to reduce your opponent's Magic Points (MP) to zero before they do the same to you. Utilize your arsenal of spells wisely to attack, defend, and outmaneuver your opponent in this intense duel of magic.

## Setup

1. **Magic Points (MP):**
   - Each player starts with **10 MP**.
   - MP represents your life force in the duel; if it drops to zero or below, you lose.

2. **Spell Cards:**
   - Each player has a set of spell cards with limited uses:
     - **Fireball**: 3 uses
     - **Shield**: 2 uses
     - **Drain**: 2 uses
     - **Recharge**: 2 uses

3. **Starting Player:**
   - Decide randomly who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or random selection).

## Game Components

1. **Players' MP:**
   - Represents each player's remaining life force.
   - Starts at 10 and decreases or increases based on spell effects.

2. **Spell Cards:**
   - **Fireball** (Attack Spell):
     - **Uses**: 3 per player
     - **Effect**: Deals 3 damage to the opponent.
   - **Shield** (Protection Spell):
     - **Uses**: 2 per player
     - **Effect**: Negates the next incoming damage.
   - **Drain** (Steal Spell):
     - **Uses**: 2 per player
     - **Effect**: Steals 2 MP from the opponent.
   - **Recharge** (Heal Spell):
     - **Uses**: 2 per player
     - **Effect**: Restores 2 MP to yourself (cannot exceed 10 MP).

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players take turns casting spells.
   - On your turn, you **must** cast one spell from your available spells.

2. **Spell Selection:**
   - Choose a spell you haven't used up.
   - Declare your spell choice to the opponent.

3. **Spell Resolution:**
   - Spells take effect immediately upon casting.
   - Effects are applied according to the spell's rules.

4. **Updating Spell Uses:**
   - After casting, reduce the available uses of that spell by one.
   - Once a spell's uses are depleted, you cannot cast it again.

5. **Opponent's Turn:**
   - After your turn ends, the opponent takes their turn following the same structure.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Spell Effects:**
   - **Fireball:**
     - Deals **3 damage** to the opponent's MP.
     - If the opponent has an active **Shield**, the damage is **negated**, and the Shield is consumed.
   - **Shield:**
     - Grants a **Shield** that negates the **next incoming damage** from an opponent's spell.
     - The Shield remains active until it negates a spell effect or until your next turn begins, whichever comes first.
   - **Drain:**
     - Reduces the opponent's MP by **2** and increases your MP by **2**.
     - If the opponent has less than 2 MP, only the available MP is stolen.
     - If the opponent has an active **Shield**, the Drain is **negated**, and the Shield is consumed.
   - **Recharge:**
     - Increases your MP by **2** (up to a maximum of 10 MP).
     - Cannot raise your MP above 10.

2. **Shield Mechanics:**
   - Shields are **temporary** and only protect against **one spell**.
   - If no damage is received before your next turn, the Shield expires.
   - Shields do **not** stack; you cannot have more than one Shield active.

3. **MP Limits:**
   - Players' MP cannot exceed **10**.
   - MP can drop below zero due to spell effects.

4. **Elimination:**
   - When a player's MP reaches **zero or below**, they are eliminated.
   - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

5. **Spell Availability:**
   - Keep track of your remaining spell uses.
   - You cannot cast a spell if you have exhausted all its uses.

## Scoring

- **MP Tracking:**
  - Continuously update both players' MP after each spell is cast.
  - No other scoring is required; the focus is on reducing the opponent's MP to zero.

  - **Result:**
    - The game reaches a stalemate.

**Note:** Since the objective is to reduce the opponent's MP to zero, and both players have depleted their spells, the player with the higher MP could be declared the winner by default if the rules permit, or players could agree to a draw (though per the game design, draws are not intended).

**Alternate Rule to Prevent Draws:**

- **Sudden Death:** If both players run out of spell uses and neither has been defeated, the player with the higher MP wins.
- **In This Example:**
  - Player 2 wins with **9 MP** over Player 1's **1 MP**.

## Strategy Tips

- **Manage Spell Uses:** Be mindful of how many times you can cast each spell. Use powerful spells like Fireball and Drain when they will have the most impact.
- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves:** Consider when your opponent might cast a Shield and plan your attacks accordingly.
- **Preserve Your MP:** Use Recharge to recover MP when you're low, but be cautious of overusing it at the expense of offensive actions.
- **Use Shields Wisely:** Casting a Shield preemptively can protect you from heavy damage but wastes a turn if the opponent doesn't attack.
