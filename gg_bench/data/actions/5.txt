In the game environment, the action space is represented as `spaces.Discrete(20)`, where each index from 0 to 19 corresponds to the numbers 1 to 20 in the sequence, respectively. When a player takes an action, they select an index `action`, which is mapped to the number `action + 1` in the sequence. Thus, each action index directly corresponds to a specific number in the sequence that can be removed according to the game's rules.
