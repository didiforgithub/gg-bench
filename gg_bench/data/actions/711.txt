The action space indices in the game map to moves as follows:
- Index 0 corresponds to the move "up."
- Index 1 corresponds to the move "down."
- Index 2 corresponds to the move "left."
- Index 3 corresponds to the move "right."

This mapping is used to translate the integer actions from the action space into the game's movement directions.
