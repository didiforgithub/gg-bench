The action space in the GridLock game enviroment is represented by the discrete values 0 through 15, corresponding to the positions in the 4x4 grid. Each index can be converted to a grid position using the formula: 

- **Row** = `action // 4`
- **Column** = `action % 4`

This mapping means:

- Action `0` represents Row 0, Column 0
- Action `1` represents Row 0, Column 1
- ...
- Action `15` represents Row 3, Column 3

Thus, each index uniquely identifies a cell on the grid by representing the row and column where a player can place a marker.
