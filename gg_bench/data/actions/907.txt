In the provided gym environment, the action space consists of discrete indices ranging from 0 to 998, which correspond to potential divisors in the game. To map these indices to actual moves, each index represents a number that is 2 greater than the index itself. Therefore, the action index of `0` corresponds to the divisor `2`, an index of `1` corresponds to the divisor `3`, and so on. This mapping allows actions to be represented compactly within the gym environment while maintaining their relationship to the game's mechanics of selecting proper divisors to divide the current number.
