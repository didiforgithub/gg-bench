# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Be the player who reduces the shared counter to **exactly zero** by subtracting allowed divisors of the current counter value. The player who makes the counter reach zero **wins the game**.

## Setup

- The game starts with a **shared counter** set to **20**.
- Determine which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss, random selection, or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Shared Counter**: A single integer value that starts at **20** and is updated throughout the game.
- **Players**: Two players who will take turns according to the game rules.

## Turns

- Players take turns **alternately**.
- On each turn, a player performs the following steps:
  1. **Identify Valid Moves**: Determine the proper divisors of the current counter value.
  2. **Choose a Divisor**: Select one of the valid divisors to subtract from the counter.
  3. **Update the Counter**: Subtract the chosen divisor from the current counter value.
- The turn passes to the other player after the counter is updated.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Choosing Divisors

- **Proper Divisors Only**: On your turn, you must subtract a **proper divisor** of the current counter value.
  - A proper divisor is any positive integer divisor of the counter value **excluding** 1 and the counter value itself.
- **Prime Numbers Exception**:
  - If the current counter value is a **prime number**, you may subtract **1**.
  - Remember that prime numbers have no proper divisors other than 1 and themselves.

### 2. Valid Moves

- **Mandatory Move**: If there is at least one valid proper divisor, you must subtract one of them.
- **No Skipping Turns**: You cannot skip your turn or pass; you must make a valid move if possible.
- **No Negative Counter**: The result after subtraction must not reduce the counter below zero.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Winning Condition**: You win if you reduce the counter to **exactly zero** on your turn.
- **Unable to Move**: If you cannot make a valid move on your turn (i.e., there are no proper divisors and the counter is not prime), you **lose** the game.

## Scoring

- The game is **won** by the player who successfully reduces the counter to zero according to the rules.
- There is no points system; the outcome is a win or loss.

## Examples

### Example Turn Sequence

**Starting Counter**: 20

---

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 20
  - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10
  - **Player 1 Chooses**: Subtract 5
  - **New Counter**: 20 - 5 = **15**

---

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 15
  - **Proper Divisors**: 3, 5
  - **Player 2 Chooses**: Subtract 5
  - **New Counter**: 15 - 5 = **10**

---

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 10
  - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 5
  - **Player 1 Chooses**: Subtract 2
  - **New Counter**: 10 - 2 = **8**

---

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 8
  - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 4
  - **Player 2 Chooses**: Subtract 4
  - **New Counter**: 8 - 4 = **4**

---

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 4
  - **Proper Divisors**: 2
  - **Player 1 Chooses**: Subtract 2
  - **New Counter**: 4 - 2 = **2**

---

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 2 (Prime Number)
  - **Player 2 Chooses**: Subtract 1
  - **New Counter**: 2 - 1 = **1**

---

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Current Counter**: 1
  - **No Proper Divisors**: 1 is not prime and has no proper divisors.
  - **Player 1 Cannot Move**: Player 1 loses the game.
  - **Player 2 Wins!**

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start! The counter is at 20.

Player 1's turn.
Current counter: 20
Available divisors to subtract: [2, 4, 5, 10]
Enter divisor to subtract: 5
Counter is now 15.

Player 2's turn.
Current counter: 15
Available divisors to subtract: [3, 5]
Enter divisor to subtract: 5
Counter is now 10.

Player 1's turn.
Current counter: 10
Available divisors to subtract: [2, 5]
Enter divisor to subtract: 2
Counter is now 8.

Player 2's turn.
Current counter: 8
Available divisors to subtract: [2, 4]
Enter divisor to subtract: 4
Counter is now 4.

Player 1's turn.
Current counter: 4
Available divisors to subtract: [2]
Enter divisor to subtract: 2
Counter is now 2.

Player 2's turn.
Current counter: 2
The counter is a prime number. You may subtract 1.
Enter number to subtract: 1
Counter is now 1.

Player 1's turn.
Current counter: 1
No valid moves available. Player 1 cannot make a move.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Force Prime Counters**: Try to leave the counter at a prime number for your opponent, limiting their options.
- **Avoid Prime Traps**: Be cautious when the counter is approaching a prime number; plan your moves to avoid being forced into subtracting 1.
- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the possible subsequent counter values resulting from your move to anticipate your opponent's options.
- **Divisor Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with the proper divisors of numbers to make quick and strategic decisions.

## Conclusion

**Divisor Duel** is a game of strategic numerical reduction. It combines simple arithmetic with forward-thinking tactics, making it easy to learn but challenging to master. Ideal for a quick battle of wits in a command-line interface, this game rewards players who can anticipate their opponent's moves and manipulate the counter to their advantage.
