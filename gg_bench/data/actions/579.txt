The action space indices in the gym environment represent the integers a player can choose to add to the total:

- Action index `0` corresponds to the move of adding `1`.
- Action index `1` corresponds to the move of adding `2`.
- Action index `2` corresponds to the move of adding `3`.
- Action index `3` corresponds to the move of adding `4`.
- Action index `4` corresponds to the move of adding `5`.

Thus, each action index from `0` to `4` maps directly to adding integers `1` to `5`, respectively, to the running total.
