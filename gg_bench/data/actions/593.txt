In the gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with four possible actions, corresponding to the indices of the list of allowed prime numbers [2, 3, 5, 7]. Each index in the action space maps to a prime number that a player can choose to divide the current number N:

- Action 0 corresponds to the prime number 2.
- Action 1 corresponds to the prime number 3.
- Action 2 corresponds to the prime number 5.
- Action 3 corresponds to the prime number 7.

A valid move in the game occurs when a player selects an action that corresponds to a prime number which exactly divides the current value of N.
