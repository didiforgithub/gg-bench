The action space indices in the environment map to the selectable numbers in the shared pool of the game. Specifically, each action index \(i\) corresponds to the number \(i + 2\). Since the pool consists of numbers from 2 to 50, the indices 0 through 48 represent numbers 2 through 50, respectively. Thus, choosing an action with a particular index selects the corresponding number from the number pool for the game move.
