In the gym environment for the game, the action space is represented by a `Discrete(8)`, which means it includes actions with indices from 0 to 7. Each index corresponds to selecting a number between 2 and 9 from the number pool. Specifically, action index 0 maps to selecting number 2, action index 1 maps to selecting number 3, and so on, up to action index 7 mapping to selecting number 9. This mapping effectively allows players to choose numbers based on the action index plus 2.
