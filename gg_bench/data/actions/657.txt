In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for the "Capture the Line" game, the action space is defined with two discrete actions: 

- **Action 0**: Corresponds to moving 1 point forward.
- **Action 1**: Corresponds to moving 2 points forward. 

These actions allow players to advance towards the center point (Point 6) according to the game rules.
