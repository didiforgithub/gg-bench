# Quantum Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce your opponent's energy level to **zero or below**, or cause them to lose through a **paradox encounter**. Utilize strategic choices of **Attack**, **Defend**, and a one-time **Paradox** to outwit your opponent.

## Setup

- **Players**: 2
- **Starting Energy**: Each player begins with **10 energy units**.
- **Initial Conditions**: No additional setup is required.

## Game Components

- **Energy Level Tracker**: A variable or counter for each player to keep track of their current energy level (starting at 10).
- **Actions**:
  - **Attack**: An offensive move to reduce the opponent's energy.
  - **Defend**: A defensive move to protect and potentially counter an opponent's attack.
  - **Paradox**: A special action that can alter the outcome dramatically, usable **only once per player per game**.

## Turns

- The game is played in **rounds**, with each round consisting of both players making their moves.
- **Order of Play**:
  - **Player 1** takes their turn by selecting an action.
  - **Player 2** then takes their turn by selecting an action.
- **Action Selection**:
  - Players choose their actions independently and secretly.
  - In a command-line interface, this can be simulated by having each player input their action without the other seeing.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Available Actions

1. **Attack**
   - Attempt to reduce the opponent's energy.
2. **Defend**
   - Protect against an opponent's attack.
3. **Paradox**
   - A unique move that can change the tide of the game but can only be used **once per game** by each player.

### Action Resolution

After both players have chosen their actions for the round, the actions are revealed and resolved according to the following rules:

1. **Attack vs. Attack**
   - Both players lose **2 energy units**.
   - *Example*: Player 1 and Player 2 both choose Attack.
     - Player 1 energy: -2
     - Player 2 energy: -2

2. **Attack vs. Defend**
   - The attacking player **steals 1 energy unit** from the defending player.
   - *Example*: Player 1 attacks, Player 2 defends.
     - Player 1 energy: +1
     - Player 2 energy: -1
     - **Note**: Player 1 cannot exceed the maximum of 10 energy units.

3. **Defend vs. Defend**
   - No change in energy levels.
   - *Example*: Both players choose Defend.
     - Player 1 energy: No change
     - Player 2 energy: No change

4. **Paradox Usage**
   - **Paradox vs. Attack**
     - The player who chose Paradox **immediately wins**; the attacking player loses.
   - **Paradox vs. Defend**
     - No effect; the game continues with no change in energy levels.
   - **Paradox vs. Paradox**
     - **Both players lose**, resulting in a loss for both.
   - **Restrictions on Paradox**:
     - Each player can only use Paradox **once per game**.
     - After a Paradox is used by a player, they cannot select it again.

### Energy Rules

- **Starting Energy**: 10 units per player.
- **Maximum Energy**: A player cannot exceed 10 energy units.
- **Energy Loss**:
  - If a player's energy drops to **zero or below**, they lose the game.
  - Energy cannot be negative for game continuation purposes.

## Scoring

- The game is won by either:
  - Reducing the opponent's energy to **zero or below**.
  - Causing the opponent to lose through a **Paradox vs. Attack** interaction.
- There are no points; it's a win/loss outcome.

## Strategy Tips

- **Predict Opponent Behavior**: Try to anticipate whether your opponent is likely to attack or defend based on their energy level and previous moves.
- **Paradox Timing**: Use your Paradox strategically when you believe your opponent will attack, maximizing the chances of an immediate win.
- **Energy Management**: Keep an eye on both your own and your opponent's energy levels to decide when to attack aggressively or defend.
- **Deception**: Occasionally vary your moves to prevent your opponent from easily predicting your strategy.

## Final Notes

- The game encourages players to think ahead and read their opponent's intentions.
- Because each player can only use **Paradox** once, deciding when to use it adds a layer of strategic depth.
- There are no draws in this game; a scenario where both players lose (double Paradox) still results in a loss for both.

Enjoy playing **Quantum Duel**, and may the most strategic mind win!
