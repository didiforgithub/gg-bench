# Rule Book for "Pathway"

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to create an unbroken path connecting your designated sides of a 5x5 grid by strategically claiming cells. Block your opponent's progress while advancing your own to achieve victory.

---

**Setup:**

1. **Grid Initialization:**
   - The game is played on a 5x5 grid consisting of 25 cells.
   - Rows are numbered from 1 to 5, starting from the bottom (row 1) to the top (row 5).
   - Columns are numbered from 1 to 5, starting from the left (column 1) to the right (column 5).
   - All cells are initially unclaimed and are identified by their coordinates (row, column).

2. **Player Assignment:**
   - **Player 1** is assigned the task of creating a vertical path connecting the bottom row to the top row.
   - **Player 2** is assigned the task of creating a horizontal path connecting the leftmost column to the rightmost column.

3. **Starting Conditions:**
   - Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
   - Both players have no claimed cells at the start.

---

**Game Components:**

1. **Grid Cells:**
   - Each cell can be in one of three states:
     - **Unclaimed (Empty):** Available for either player to claim.
     - **Claimed by Player 1:** Marked with 'X' or another distinct symbol.
     - **Claimed by Player 2:** Marked with 'O' or a different distinct symbol.

2. **Player Markers:**
   - Symbols or identifiers used to mark claimed cells on the grid.
   - **Player 1:** Uses 'X'.
   - **Player 2:** Uses 'O'.

3. **Grid Coordinates:**
   - Used for identifying and selecting cells during gameplay.
   - Format: (row, column), e.g., (3,2).

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - The player designated to go first makes the initial move.

2. **Turn Actions:**
   - On your turn, perform the following steps:
     1. **Input Selection:**
        - Enter the coordinates of an unclaimed cell you wish to claim.
     2. **Validation:**
        - Ensure the selected cell is within the grid and unclaimed.
        - If the cell is already claimed or invalid, you must choose a different cell.
     3. **Claiming the Cell:**
        - Mark the cell with your designated symbol on the grid.
     4. **Grid Update:**
        - Display the updated grid to both players.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - The turn passes to the other player after a valid cell has been claimed and the grid updated.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Claiming Cells:**
   - Only one cell may be claimed per turn.
   - A cell, once claimed, cannot be claimed again or changed.

2. **Path Formation:**
   - **Player 1's Objective (Vertical Path):**
     - Create a continuous path of vertically or horizontally adjacent cells connecting any cell in the bottom row (row 1) to any cell in the top row (row 5).
   - **Player 2's Objective (Horizontal Path):**
     - Create a continuous path of vertically or horizontally adjacent cells connecting any cell in the leftmost column (column 1) to any cell in the rightmost column (column 5).
   - **Adjacency Rules:**
     - Cells are considered adjacent if they are directly above, below, or beside each other (no diagonal connections).

3. **Blocking:**
   - Players may claim cells that could be used by their opponent to block their path.
   - Strategic blocking is a key element of gameplay.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to complete their respective path wins immediately.
   - A completed path must be continuous and unbroken, following the adjacency rules.

5. **Continuous Play:**
   - If neither player has completed their path and unclaimed cells remain, the game continues.
   - The game cannot end in a draw due to the grid size and path requirements.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Victory:** Achieved by forming the required continuous path before your opponent.
- **No Points System:** The game is won outright; no point tracking is necessary.
- **Strategic Depth:** Success depends on strategic claiming and blocking rather than accumulating points.

       ```
         5 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
         4 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
         3 [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

**Strategic Tips:**

- **Balancing Offense and Defense:**
  - While focusing on building your path, keep an eye on your opponent's progress.
  - Use turns to block key cells that your opponent needs for their path.

- **Key Positions:**
  - Control of central cells can offer more options for expansion and blocking.
  - Corners and edges can be strategic for blocking your opponent's paths.

- **Planning Ahead:**
  - Think several moves ahead to anticipate your opponent's strategy.
  - Reserve critical cells for future turns if they are not immediately threatened.

---

**Game Variations:**

- **Increased Grid Size:**
  - For a longer game with more complexity, use a larger grid (e.g., 7x7).
  
- **Diagonal Connections:**
  - Allow diagonal connections to increase the number of possible paths.

- **Random Obstacles:**
  - Introduce randomly placed blocked cells at the start of the game to add unpredictability.
