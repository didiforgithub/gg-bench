In the game, actions are represented as indices in the range of 0 to 8 within the action space. These indices directly correspond to numbers 1 through 9, which are the possible moves in the game. Specifically, action index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which maps to the number 9. This mapping allows players to select numbers from 1 to 9 based on the action index chosen during their turn.
