The action space indices in the game are mapped directly to possible divisors of the current number. Each index corresponds to a divisor ranging from 2 to 60. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to the divisor 2, index 1 to 3, and so on, up to index 58 which corresponds to the divisor 60. This mapping allows each action to represent a choice of divisor, aligning the gym environment's discrete action space with the game's mechanics of selecting divisors from a set range.
