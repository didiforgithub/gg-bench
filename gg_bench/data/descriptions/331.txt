# GridLock

## Objective

GridLock is a strategic two-player game where the goal is to be the last player able to place a mark on a shared grid. Players take turns placing their marks on the grid while blocking adjacent cells for their opponent. The player who successfully forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move wins the game.

## Setup

At the beginning of the game, an empty 3x3 grid is presented:

```
[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
```

- The grid consists of 9 cells, arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns.
- Players decide who will be Player 1 (`X`) and Player 2 (`O`).
- All cells are initially unclaimed and unblocked.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 3x3 grid representing the game board.
- **Marks**: Each player has a unique mark (`X` for Player 1 and `O` for Player 2) used to claim cells on the grid.
- **Blocked Cells**: Cells that are temporarily unavailable for placement due to the opponent's last move.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1 (`X`).
- On each turn, a player places their mark on an unclaimed and unblocked cell.
  
  **Turn Structure**:
  
  1. **Input Move**: The player selects a cell to place their mark by specifying the row and column numbers.
  2. **Validation**: The game checks if the selected cell is unclaimed and unblocked.
  3. **Placement**: If valid, the player's mark is placed in the selected cell.
  4. **Blocking**: All orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) become blocked for the opponent's next turn.
  5. **Display Grid**: The updated grid is displayed, showing claimed cells, blocked cells, and available cells.
  6. **Turn Ends**: Control passes to the other player.

- **Blocked Cells**:

  - Blocked cells are only blocked for the opponent's next turn.
  - After the opponent's turn, previously blocked cells become unblocked unless they are blocked again by the opponent's move.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Placing Marks**:

   - A player can only place their mark on a cell that is both unclaimed and unblocked for them.
   - Diagonal adjacency does not cause blocking.

2. **Blocking Mechanism**:

   - When a player places their mark, they block all orthogonally adjacent cells for their opponent's next turn.
   - Blocked cells are marked with the opponent's symbol in lowercase (e.g., `x` or `o`) to indicate temporary blockage.
   - Blocking does not affect cells already claimed.

3. **Claimed Cells**:

   - Once a cell is claimed by a player, it cannot be claimed or blocked again.
   - Claimed cells remain occupied for the rest of the game.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn because all available cells are claimed or blocked, they lose.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.

5. **Game End**:

   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot place a mark on their turn.
   - If all cells are claimed or blocked and neither player can make a move, the last player to have placed a mark wins.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Winning the game by successfully forcing the opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **No Point System**: There are no points; the outcome is a win or loss based on the game mechanics.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

Below is a sample game illustrating how turns proceed, including command-line interactions.

#### Initial Grid

```
[1,1] [1,2] [1,3]
[2,1] [2,2] [2,3]
[3,1] [3,2] [3,3]
```

**Note**: Cells are identified by their row and column numbers.

#### Turn 1: Player 1 (`X`)

- **Input Move**: Player 1 places `X` at (2,2).

```
Enter your move, Player X (row and column): 2 2
```

- **Grid After Move**:

```
[ ]   [ ]   [ ]
 [ ] [X] [ ]
[ ]   [ ]   [ ]
```

- **Cells Blocked for Player 2 (`O`)**:

  - (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)

- **Updated Grid**:

```
[ ]   [o]   [ ]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o]   [ ]
```

#### Turn 2: Player 2 (`O`)

- **Available Moves**: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)
- **Input Move**: Player 2 places `O` at (1,1).

```
Enter your move, Player O (row and column): 1 1
```

- **Grid After Move**:

```
[O]   [o]   [ ]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o]   [ ]
```

- **Cells Blocked for Player 1 (`X`)**:

  - (1,2), (2,1)

- **Updated Grid**:

```
[O]   [o]   [ ]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o]   [ ]
```

**Note**: Since (1,2) and (2,1) are already blocked, they remain blocked.

#### Turn 3: Player 1 (`X`)

- **Available Moves**: (1,3), (3,1), (3,3)
- **Input Move**: Player 1 places `X` at (3,3).

```
Enter your move, Player X (row and column): 3 3
```

- **Grid After Move**:

```
[O]   [o]   [ ]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o] [X]
```

- **Cells Blocked for Player 2 (`O`)**:

  - (2,3), (3,2)

- **Updated Grid**:

```
[O]   [o]   [ ]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o] [X]
```

#### Turn 4: Player 2 (`O`)

- **Available Moves**: (1,3), (3,1)
- **Input Move**: Player 2 places `O` at (1,3).

```
Enter your move, Player O (row and column): 1 3
```

- **Grid After Move**:

```
[O]   [o]   [O]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o] [X]
```

- **Cells Blocked for Player 1 (`X`)**:

  - (1,2), (2,3)

- **Updated Grid**:

```
[O]   [o]   [O]
 [o] [X] [o]
[ ]   [o] [X]
```

**Note**: Again, blocked cells may overlap with previously blocked or claimed cells.

#### Turn 5: Player 1 (`X`)

- **Available Moves**: (3,1)
- **Input Move**: Player 1 places `X` at (3,1).

```
Enter your move, Player X (row and column): 3 1
```

- **Grid After Move**:

```
[O]   [o]   [O]
 [o] [X] [o]
[X]   [o] [X]
```

- **Cells Blocked for Player 2 (`O`)**:

  - (2,1), (3,2)

- **Updated Grid**:

```
[O]   [o]   [O]
 [o] [X] [o]
[X]   [o] [X]
```

#### Turn 6: Player 2 (`O`)

- **Available Moves**: None

Player 2 has no valid moves left.

**Game Over**:

```
Player O has no valid moves left. Player X wins!
```

## Strategies and Tips

- **Center Control**: Claiming the center cell early can block multiple options for the opponent.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into positions where their choices are limited.
- **Blocking Awareness**: Keep track of which cells will be blocked after your move, and plan accordingly to maximize your control.
- **Anticipate Opponent's Options**: Before placing your mark, consider which cells will be available to your opponent and whether you can limit their moves.

## Command-Line Interaction

- The game prompts each player for input on their turn.
- Invalid inputs or moves are rejected with an explanation, and the player is prompted to try again.
- The grid is displayed after each turn, showing:

  - Player marks (`X` or `O`)
  - Blocked cells (`x` or `o`)
  - Available cells (`[ ]`)

- Game status updates inform players of blocked cells and remaining moves.

**Example Interaction**:

```
Current Grid:
[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ]

Enter your move, Player X (row and column): 2 2

You placed X at (2,2).
Blocking cells for Player O: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)

Updated Grid:
[ ] [o] [ ]
[o] [X] [o]
[ ] [o] [ ]

Enter your move, Player O (row and column): ...
```

## Conclusion

GridLock is a simple yet strategically rich game that challenges players to think ahead and control the board. With its straightforward rules and quick gameplay, it's easy to learn and provides depth for skilled players to consistently outperform less experienced opponents.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
