The action space consists of 18 discrete actions, representing combinations of selecting one of the 9 digits (from 1 to 9) and placing it either on the left ('L') or right ('R') of the current number. Specifically, each action index maps to a tuple (digit, side), where:

- Action index 0 maps to (1, 'L')
- Action index 1 maps to (1, 'R')
- Action index 2 maps to (2, 'L')
- Action index 3 maps to (2, 'R')
- ...
- Action index 16 maps to (9, 'L')
- Action index 17 maps to (9, 'R')

This mapping allows players to choose any available digit and place it on either side of their current number in the game. Each pair of indices (2*i, 2*i+1) corresponds to digit (i+1) being placed on the left or the right, respectively.
