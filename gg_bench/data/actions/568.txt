In the gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.initial_number + 1)`, meaning it includes all integers from 0 to `self.initial_number` (inclusive). However, valid game moves correspond to the proper divisors of the current shared number, which can dynamically change each turn. The action taken must match one of these valid divisors; otherwise, it is considered invalid and results in a penalty or loss. The mapping between action indices and game moves is indirect: the indices correspond to potential moves, but only those that align with current proper divisors are valid within the game's context.
