In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 9, corresponding to the moves of selecting numbers 1 to 10, respectively. Specifically, the action index `i` maps to the number `i + 1` in the game. This means if a player selects action index 0, they choose the number 1; if they select action index 1, they choose the number 2; and so on, up to action index 9, which corresponds to selecting the number 10.
