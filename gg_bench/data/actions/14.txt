In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 8, corresponding to the cards numbered from 1 to 9. When a player selects an action represented by an index `i`, it maps to playing the card numbered `i + 1` from the player's hand. This mapping ensures that each action in the space selects a specific card, using 0-based indexing of the actions to refer to the cards which inherently start from number 1.
