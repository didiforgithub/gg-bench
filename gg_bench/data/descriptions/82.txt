# Divider

## Objective

The objective of **Divider** is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a legal move. Players take turns subtracting proper divisors from a shared number. The player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Number (N):** The game begins with a positive integer greater than 1. The default starting number is **100**, but players can agree on any starting number to adjust the game's difficulty and length.
- **Players:** Two players participate, deciding who goes first through mutual agreement or randomly.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):** A positive integer that is updated throughout the game.
- **Proper Divisors:** For any number N, these are all positive integers greater than 1 and less than N that divide N exactly (without leaving a remainder).

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors:** On your turn, determine all proper divisors of the current number N.
  2. **Select Divisor to Subtract:** Choose one proper divisor to subtract from N.
  3. **Subtract and Update N:** Subtract the chosen divisor from N to get the new N.
  4. **Announce Move:** State the chosen divisor and the new value of N.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Legal Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must subtract a proper divisor of N from N.
   - **Proper Divisors** exclude 1 and N itself.
   - If N has no proper divisors (i.e., N is prime or N equals 1), you cannot make a move and lose the game.

2. **Subtraction Rules:**
   - Only one proper divisor can be subtracted per turn.
   - The chosen divisor must divide N exactly.
   - After subtraction, N is updated for the next player's turn.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your opponent cannot make a legal move on their turn, you win.
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a move.

4. **Invalid Moves:**
   - Selecting a number that is not a proper divisor of N is an invalid move.
   - If an invalid move is made, the player must choose a valid divisor or concede the game if no valid moves are available.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- The outcome is a win or a loss.
- **Winner:** The player who forces their opponent into a position with no legal moves.

## Examples

### Example Game:

**Starting Number (N):** 15

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 15: 3, 5
  - Player 1 chooses to subtract 5.
  - New N: 15 - 5 = **10**
  
- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 10: 2, 5
  - Player 2 chooses to subtract 5.
  - New N: 10 - 5 = **5**
  
- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 5: None (5 is prime)
  - Player 1 cannot make a move.
  - **Player 2 wins the game!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example:

```plaintext
Game Start! Starting number (N): 15

Player 1's turn.
Current N: 15
Proper divisors of 15: 3, 5
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
Player 1 subtracts 5 from 15. New N is 10.

Player 2's turn.
Current N: 10
Proper divisors of 10: 2, 5
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
Player 2 subtracts 5 from 10. New N is 5.

Player 1's turn.
Current N: 5
Proper divisors of 5: None
Player 1 cannot make a legal move.
Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Try to anticipate the results of your move on the next turn.
- **Aim for Primes:** Leave your opponent with a prime number or 1 to limit their options.
- **Divisor Choice:** Choose divisors that result in numbers with fewer proper divisors.

## Conclusion

**Divider** is a simple yet strategic numerical game that challenges players to think ahead and use basic arithmetic skills. The straightforward rules make it easy to play in a command-line interface, and the game typically concludes quickly. Mastery comes from recognizing patterns and planning several moves in advance, allowing skilled players to consistently outperform less experienced opponents.
