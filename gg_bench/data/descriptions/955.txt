**Game Title: Sequence Duel**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to successfully create a continuous numerical sequence of a specified length from a shared pool of numbers. The sequence must consist of consecutive numbers in ascending order. The game tests strategic planning and foresight, allowing skilled players to consistently outperform unskilled ones.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers ranging from **1** to **20**.
2. **Sequence Length**: Decide on the sequence length required to win (e.g., **5** numbers).
3. **Initial Hands**: Both players start with an empty hand.
4. **Starting Conditions**: Determine randomly who takes the first turn (e.g., flip a coin or let the youngest player start).

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Number Pool**:
   - A list of numbers from **1** to **20**.
   - Each number is available only once; once taken, it is removed from the pool.
2. **Player Hands**:
   - Each player has a personal collection area (their "hand") where they hold the numbers they've selected.
3. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Players interact by entering commands to select numbers and view hands.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players alternate turns.
   - On each turn, a player selects **one** number from the shared pool.
2. **Actions Per Turn**:
   - **Select Number**: Choose an available number from the pool.
   - **View Hands** (Optional): Players can view their own hand and the opponent's hand at any time.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The game continues with players taking turns until one player achieves a valid sequence or no more valid moves can be made.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Selecting Numbers**:
   - Players must select numbers strategically to build a consecutive ascending sequence.
   - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool and cannot be chosen again.
2. **Building a Sequence**:
   - A valid sequence consists of consecutive numbers in ascending order (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
   - The sequence length required to win is predetermined (e.g., 5 numbers).
3. **Blocking Opponents**:
   - Players can select numbers that their opponent may need, introducing a strategic blocking element.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to collect the required number of consecutive numbers in ascending order wins.
5. **No Valid Moves**:
   - If neither player can possibly achieve the sequence with the remaining numbers, the player with the **longest consecutive sequence** wins.
   - If tied, the player with the **highest numerical sequence** wins (e.g., 6-7-8 beats 3-4-5).

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winning Condition**: Successfully create a consecutive ascending sequence of the predetermined length.
- **Alternate Winning Condition**: If the main condition can't be met, the player with the longest consecutive sequence wins.
- **Tie-Breaker**: If both players have sequences of equal length, the player with the higher numerical sequence wins.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Standard Playthrough**

**Sequence Length**: 3

**Number Pool**: 1-10

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1** selects **5**.
- **Player 1's Hand**: 5

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2** selects **6**.
- **Player 2's Hand**: 6

### **Additional Notes**

- **Strategic Depth**:
  - Players must balance between building their own sequence and blocking their opponent.
  - Observing the numbers the opponent selects is crucial for anticipating their strategy.
- **Game Variations**:
  - **Adjusting Sequence Length**: Increase for longer games, decrease for shorter ones.
  - **Expanding Number Pool**: Use a larger range for more complexity.
  - **Multiple Sequences**: Require players to build more than one sequence to win.
