In the game environment, the action space is defined with `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing numbers indexed from 0 to 8, which correspond to the numbers 1 to 9 in the game. Each action index corresponds to capturing a specific number from the shared list. For example, an action index of `0` captures the number `1`, an action index of `1` captures the number `2`, and so on, up to an action index of `8` which captures the number `9`.
