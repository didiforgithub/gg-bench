In the **String Duel** game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with two possible actions represented by indices: `0` and `1`. The mapping between these action indices and the moves in the game is as follows:

- **Action Index `0`**: Represents appending the character `'A'` to the shared string.
- **Action Index `1`**: Represents appending the character `'B'` to the shared string.

This mapping allows a player to choose between adding an `'A'` or a `'B'` to the shared string on their turn.
