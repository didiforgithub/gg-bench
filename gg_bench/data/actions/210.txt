The action space indices (0-9) correspond to selecting numbers 1 through 10 in the game. Specifically, each action index is mapped to a move by adding 1 to the index value. For example, an action of 0 selects the number 1, an action of 1 selects the number 2, and so on up to an action of 9 which selects the number 10.
