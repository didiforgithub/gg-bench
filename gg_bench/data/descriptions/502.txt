# Palindrome Duel

## Objective

The primary goal of **Palindrome Duel** is to be the **first player to create a palindrome of at least three digits** by sequentially adding digits to a shared number sequence. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121, 1331). Players achieve victory by strategically adding digits to either end of the current number sequence to form a palindrome while preventing their opponent from doing so.

## Setup

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - The game begins with an **empty number sequence**.
   - Determine who will take the first turn (e.g., by mutual agreement or a coin toss).

2. **Understanding the Components:**
   - Both players should be familiar with the digits available (0-9) and how to form palindromes.
   - No physical components are needed other than the command-line interface where the game will be played.

## Game Components

- **Digits (0-9):** These are the elements used to build the number sequence. Each digit can be used multiple times.
  
- **Shared Number Sequence:** A sequence of digits that both players contribute to on their turns. It starts empty and grows as the game progresses.

- **Command-Line Interface:** The medium through which players input their choices and view the current state of the game.

## Turns

- **Turn Order:**
  - Players take turns alternately according to the starting arrangement decided in the setup.

- **Player Actions:**
  - On their turn, a player must perform the following action:
    - **Add a Single Digit:** Choose any digit from 0 to 9.
    - **Placement:** Decide to add the digit to either the **beginning** or the **end** of the shared number sequence.

- **Progression:**
  - After each turn, the game checks if the current sequence forms a valid palindrome of at least three digits.
  - The game continues until a player wins by forming a palindrome or the maximum sequence length is reached.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Adding Digits:**
   - **Digit Selection:** On your turn, select any single digit (0-9).
   - **Placement Choice:** You may add the digit to the **beginning** or **end** of the shared number sequence.
   - **Example:**
     - Current sequence: `123`
     - Player adds `4` to the beginning: New sequence: `4123`
     - Player adds `5` to the end: New sequence: `1235`

2. **Forming Palindromes:**
   - **Winning Condition:** If after your turn the shared number sequence reads the same backward and forward and is at least **three digits long**, you win.
   - **Example Palindromes:**
     - `121`, `1331`, `12321`
   - **Non-Palindromes:**
     - `12`, `123`, `12431`
   - **Immediate Win Check:** The game checks for a palindrome immediately after a digit is added.

3. **Preventing Opponent's Win:**
   - **Strategic Blocking:** Players should anticipate potential palindromes and block their opponent by adding digits that prevent a palindrome formation.
   - **Example:**
     - If the sequence is `1221`, adding a digit other than `1` or `2` to the appropriate end can prevent the opponent from forming a palindrome on their next turn.

4. **Sequence Length Limit:**
   - **Maximum Length:** The shared number sequence cannot exceed **15 digits**.
   - **Game End Condition:** If the sequence reaches 15 digits without a winner, the player who did **not** make the last move (i.e., the second player) wins the game.

5. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - **Mandatory Action:** Players must add a digit on their turn; passing or skipping a turn is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **Victory:** Winning is achieved by being the **first to form a valid palindrome** as per the rules.
- **No Points System:** There is no point tracking; the game is won by meeting the objective.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial State:**
- Shared sequence: *(empty)*

**Turn 1 (Player 1):**
- Adds digit **3** to the **end**.
- New sequence: `3`

**Turn 2 (Player 2):**
- Adds digit **1** to the **beginning**.
- New sequence: `13`

**Turn 3 (Player 1):**
- Adds digit **2** to the **end**.
- New sequence: `132`

**Turn 4 (Player 2):**
- Adds digit **1** to the **end**.
- New sequence: `1321`

**Turn 5 (Player 1):**
- Adds digit **3** to the **beginning**.
- New sequence: `31321`

**Check for Palindrome:**
- The sequence `31321` is not a palindrome.

**Turn 6 (Player 2):**
- Adds digit **3** to the **end**.
- New sequence: `313213`

**Check for Palindrome:**
- The sequence `313213` is not a palindrome.

**Turn 7 (Player 1):**
- Adds digit **1** to the **end**.
- New sequence: `3132131`

**Check for Palindrome:**
- The sequence `3132131` **is a palindrome**.
- **Player 1 wins the game.**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```

Checking for palindrome...
The sequence 3132131 is a palindrome!
Player 1 wins the game!
```

**Note:** Players should pay close attention to the sequence at each turn to strategize effectively.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate how the sequence could form a palindrome in upcoming turns, both for you and your opponent.
- **Balance Offense and Defense:** While trying to build towards a palindrome, also consider moves that prevent your opponent from completing one.
- **Use Symmetry to Your Advantage:** Adding the same digit your opponent adds can sometimes prevent them from achieving a palindrome.
- **Control the Middle:** Since palindromes read the same backward and forward, the middle digit(s) are pivotal.

## Conclusion

**Palindrome Duel** is a simple yet captivating game that challenges players to think critically and strategically. Its straightforward rules make it easy to learn and code, especially suited for a command-line interface. Despite its simplicity, the game offers depth that allows a skilled player to consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent. Enjoy the battle of wits as you and your opponent duel to create the elusive palindrome!
