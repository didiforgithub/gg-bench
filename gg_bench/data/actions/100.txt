The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` gym environment correspond to the cells in the 5x5 grid, which are numbered from 0 to 24. Each index represents a position in the grid in a row-major order. For a given index `n`, the row and column can be determined by `row = n // 5` and `col = n % 5`. For example, index 0 maps to cell (0,0), index 1 to (0,1), up to index 24 which maps to (4,4). This sequential mapping allows each possible grid move to be uniquely identified by a single integer.
