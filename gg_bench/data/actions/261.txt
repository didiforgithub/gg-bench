In this environment, each action is represented by a unique index derived from a combination of two components: the position in the Shared List and the first split number. The action index is calculated as follows: `action = position_in_list * MAX_NUMBER + (first_split_number - 1)`. Here, `position_in_list` is the index of the number in the Shared List to be split, and `first_split_number` is the first positive integer resulting from the split. The value `first_split_number - 1` is used to ensure that valid actions span the range of possible splits (starting from 1). Thus, each action index uniquely maps to selecting a number in the list and dividing it into two parts, guiding the step function to execute the game move accordingly.
