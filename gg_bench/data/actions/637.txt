In the gym environment for Divisor Duel, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.starting_number + 1)`, which means actions are indexed from 0 to the starting number inclusive. However, in the context of the game, a valid action corresponds to a proper divisor of the current number, which are integers strictly between 1 and the current number itself. Therefore, the valid moves are a subset of these indices, mapping specifically to those indices that correspond to proper divisors of the current number, filtered through the `valid_moves()` function. This means only specific indices that represent valid divisors can be chosen, aligning the gym action space with the game's rules for divisor selection.
