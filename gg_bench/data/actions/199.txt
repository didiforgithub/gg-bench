In the gym environment's action space, each index from 0 to 8 corresponds to selecting one of the numbers from 1 to 9 in the shared pool. The index represents the number minus one; for example, index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on up to index 8, which corresponds to selecting the number 9. Thus, when a player takes an action with a particular index, they are choosing the respective number from the pool to add to their hand.
