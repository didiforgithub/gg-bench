## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **Movement Rules**

- Agents move to adjacent cells, including diagonals.
- Agents cannot move off the grid.
- Agents cannot move to a cell occupied by another agent or a known trap.

### **Trap Rules**

- **Placement**:
  - Declared by specifying the coordinates (e.g., "TRAP 3 4").
  - Traps are hidden from the opponent.
- **Triggering Traps**:
  - If an agent moves onto a cell containing a trap:
    - The trap is revealed and removed from the game.
    - The agent is sent back to their **own flag's position**.
- **Limitations**:
  - Traps cannot be placed on flags or cells currently occupied.
  - Players cannot place a trap on their own agent's current position.

### **Capturing the Flag**

- The game is won by moving your agent onto the opponent's flag position.
- The opponent's flag position is fixed and known.

### **Additional Mechanics**

- **Hidden Information**:
  - Trap locations are secret until triggered.
  - Agentsâ€™ positions are public knowledge.
- **Collision**:
  - Agents cannot occupy the same cell.
  - If movement would result in collision, the move is invalid.

---

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to **capture the opponent's flag** wins.

- **Losing the Game**:
  - If a player cannot make a legal move on their turn (not applicable in this game due to movement and trap options), the game continues as normal.
