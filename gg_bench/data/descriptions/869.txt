# Number Chain

## Objective

Be the first player to successfully extend the number chain to reach the target length by adding numbers according to specific rules. A player wins by being able to make a valid move when the opponent cannot, or by being the first to reach the chain length of 10.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a single number: **1**.
- **Chain Length**: Agree on a target chain length (default is **10** numbers).
- **Player Order**: Decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Number Chain**: A sequential list of numbers starting with 1, extended by players.
- **Players**: Two players take turns to add numbers to the chain.
- **Available Numbers**: All positive integers greater than 1 (each number can be used only once).

## Turns

- Players alternate turns.
- On each turn, a player adds **one** number to the end of the chain, following the game rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Adding a Number

- **Increasing Order**: The number added must be **greater than** the last number in the chain.

### 2. Validity Criteria

The new number must satisfy **at least one** of the following conditions with respect to the **previous number** in the chain:

- **Divisibility**: The new number is divisible by the previous number.
  - *Mathematically*: `New Number % Previous Number == 0`.
- **Common Digit**: The new number shares at least one digit with the previous number.
  - *Example*: Previous number is 14; valid next numbers could be 24 (shares '4') or 17 (shares '1').

### 3. Restrictions

- **Unique Numbers**: Each number can be used only once in the game.
- **Positive Integers**: Only positive integers greater than the previous number are allowed.

### 4. Winning the Game

- **Victory by Completion**: Be the first to extend the chain to the agreed target length (e.g., 10 numbers).
- **Victory by Default**: If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you win.

## Scoring

- No points are tracked beyond the chain length.
- The focus is on extending the chain according to the rules.
- Optional: Play multiple rounds and keep track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Sample Turn Sequence

**Initial Chain**: `1`

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Adds **2**:
     - 2 > 1
     - 2 % 1 == 0 (Divisible)
   - **Chain**: `1, 2`

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Adds **4**:
     - 4 > 2
     - 4 % 2 == 0 (Divisible)
   - **Chain**: `1, 2, 4`

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Adds **14**:
     - 14 > 4
     - Shares digit '4' with 4 (Common Digit)
   - **Chain**: `1, 2, 4, 14`

4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Adds **28**:
     - 28 > 14
     - 28 % 14 == 0 (Divisible)
   - **Chain**: `1, 2, 4, 14, 28`

5. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Adds **42**:
     - 42 > 28
     - Shares digit '2' with 28 (Common Digit)
   - **Chain**: `1, 2, 4, 14, 28, 42`

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

```
Current Chain: 1, 2, 4
Player 1's Turn
Enter a number greater than 4: 14
Valid move! 14 shares a digit with 4.
New Chain: 1, 2, 4, 14

Current Chain: 1, 2, 4, 14
Player 2's Turn
Enter a number greater than 14: 28
Valid move! 28 is divisible by 14.
New Chain: 1, 2, 4, 14, 28

Current Chain: 1, 2, 4, 14, 28
Player 1's Turn
Enter a number greater than 28: 35
Invalid move! 35 is not divisible by 28 and shares no common digits.
Player 1 loses. Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategies

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future numbers to ensure valid moves on subsequent turns.
- **Limit Opponent's Options**: Choose numbers that reduce the number of valid moves for your opponent.
- **Balance Divisibility and Common Digits**: Use both criteria to maximize your options.

## Game End

- The game concludes when the chain reaches the target length or when a player cannot make a valid move.
- The player who successfully extends the chain or who causes their opponent to have no valid moves is declared the winner.

## Notes

- **Uniqueness**: "Number Chain" is a unique game with its own set of mechanics, not directly resembling existing games like Nim or Tic-Tac-Toe.
- **Command-Line Implementation**: The game is designed for easy coding in a command-line interface, requiring simple input and output functions.
- **Strategic Depth**: Despite its simplicity, the game offers strategic complexity, rewarding skilled play over chance.

Enjoy playing **Number Chain** and may the best strategist win!
