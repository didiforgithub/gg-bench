The action space in the environment is defined as a discrete space with 49 possible actions, represented by integers from 0 to 48. Each index corresponds to a number in the shared pool of numbers from 2 to 50. Specifically, an action `i` maps to selecting the number `i + 2` in the game. For example, if the action is `0`, it corresponds to picking the number `2`; if the action is `1`, it corresponds to picking the number `3`; and if the action is `48`, it corresponds to picking the number `50`. This mapping allows each index in the action space to directly correspond to one of the available numbers in the pool.
