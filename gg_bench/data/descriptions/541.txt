# Factor Duel

## Objective

**Factor Duel** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where players take turns dividing a shared number by its factors. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move, thereby securing a win. Victory is achieved by skillfully selecting factors to reduce the current number to a prime number on your opponent's turn, leaving them without any valid moves.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Both players agree on an initial positive integer greater than 1 that is **not a prime number**. For a quick game, choose a smaller number (e.g., 30 or 48). For a more challenging game, select a larger number.

2. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

3. **Initial State**: The agreed-upon starting number becomes the **current number** for the first turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that changes as players divide it by its factors. It starts as the agreed-upon starting number.

- **Factors**: Numbers that divide the current number exactly (without leaving a remainder), excluding 1 and the number itself.

---

## Turns

1. **Player's Turn Structure**:

   - **Step 1**: Identify all valid factors of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
   - **Step 2**: Select one of the valid factors.
   - **Step 3**: Divide the current number by the selected factor to obtain a new current number.
   - **Step 4**: Announce the selected factor and the new current number to the opponent.

2. **Turn Progression**:

   - Players alternate turns following the above structure.
   - The new current number from one player's turn becomes the current number for the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:

   - **Factor Selection**: Players must choose a factor greater than 1 and less than the current number.
   - **Exact Division**: The selected factor must divide the current number exactly (no remainders).

2. **Updating the Current Number**:

   - After dividing, the result becomes the new current number for the next turn.
   - The current number must always be an integer greater than 1.

3. **Prime Number Rule**:

   - If the current number is a **prime number** on a player's turn, that player loses the game because no valid factors (excluding 1 and itself) are available.
   - The player who reduced the current number to a prime number wins.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - **Win Condition**: Force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - **Losing the Game**: Unable to select a valid factor on your turn due to the current number being prime.

5. **Illegal Moves**:

   - If a player selects an invalid factor (one that does not divide the current number exactly), they automatically lose the game.
   - Honesty is crucial; players must ensure their moves are valid.

6. **Repeated Factors**:

   - Factors can be reused in later turns if they are valid factors of the new current number.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; it continues until one player wins.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Number**: 60

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:

- **Current Number**: 60
- **Valid Factors**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1 Chooses**: 6
- **Calculation**: 60 รท 6 = **10**
- **Announcement**: "I divide by 6. The new number is 10."

---

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:

- **Current Number**: 10
- **Valid Factors**: 2, 5
- **Player 2 Chooses**: 2
- **Calculation**: 10 รท 2 = **5**
- **Announcement**: "I divide by 2. The new number is 5."

---

**Turn 3 - Player 1**:

- **Current Number**: 5 (a prime number)
- **No Valid Factors**: Player 1 cannot make a move.
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins the game.**

### Example Command-Line Interaction

```
Game Start! The starting number is 48.

Player 1's Turn:
- Current Number: 48
- Valid Factors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24
- Enter a factor of 48: 8
- You chose factor 8.
- New Current Number: 48 รท 8 = 6
- Announce: "I divide by 8. The new number is 6."

Player 2's Turn:
- Current Number: 6
- Valid Factors: 2, 3
- Enter a factor of 6: 3
- You chose factor 3.
- New Current Number: 6 รท 3 = 2
- Announce: "I divide by 3. The new number is 2."

Player 1's Turn:
- Current Number: 2 (a prime number)
- No valid factors available.
- Announce: "No valid moves. Congratulations, Player 2! You win the game."
```

## Strategies

- **Prime Positioning**: Aim to leave the current number as a prime on your opponent's turn.
- **Factor Selection**: Choose factors that reduce the current number to a smaller composite number with limited factors.
- **Look Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering how your chosen factor affects the next possible factors.
- **Avoiding Large Reductions**: Sometimes reducing the current number by the largest factor gives your opponent an advantage.

---

## Tips for Skilled Play

- **Calculate Ahead**: Before selecting a factor, mentally compute a few moves ahead to foresee potential outcomes.
- **Control the Game**: Take control early by steering the current number into ranges where you can predict the opponent's options.
- **Know Your Numbers**: Familiarize yourself with factor patterns of common numbers to make quicker decisions.
