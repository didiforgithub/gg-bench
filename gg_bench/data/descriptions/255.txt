# Number Stack Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Primary Goal**: The objective of *Number Stack Duel* is to be the last player able to make a valid move by strategically placing numbers on a shared stack while following an alternating pattern of "greater than" and "less than."

**Victory Conditions**:
- **Win**: You win if your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **Loss**: You lose if you cannot make a valid move on your turn following the game's rules.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization**:
   - A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9** is available.
   - Each number can be used only **once** during the game.

2. **Stack Initialization**:
   - The game begins with an **empty stack**.

3. **Player Order**:
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Players will take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.

## Game Components

1. **Number Pool**:
   - **Numbers**: Integers from **1** to **9**.
   - **Usage**: Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool for the remainder of the game.

2. **Stack**:
   - A virtual stack where numbers are placed on top of each other.
   - **Function**: Maintains the sequence of numbers played.

3. **Pattern Indicator**:
   - Determines the required relationship between the current number and the previous number.
   - Alternates between **"greater than" (>)** and **"less than" (<)** after each turn following the first move.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Player's Turn Start**:
   - The player is informed of the **current pattern** and the **top number** on the stack (if any).
   - The player views the **available numbers** in the pool.

2. **Action**:
   - The player selects an **unused number** from the pool that satisfies the current pattern in relation to the top number on the stack.
   - The selected number is then **placed on top of the stack**.

3. **Pattern Alternation**:
   - After a valid move, the pattern **switches**:
     - If the pattern was **greater than (>)**, it changes to **less than (<)**.
     - If it was **less than (<)**, it changes to **greater than (>)**.
   - This pattern will dictate the next player's valid moves.

4. **Turn End**:
   - If a player **cannot make a valid move**, they **lose**, and the game ends.
   - Otherwise, the turn passes to the next player.

### Turn Progression

- **First Turn**:
  - Player 1 can choose **any number** from the pool.
  - The initial pattern for the next turn is set to **"greater than" (>)**.

- **Subsequent Turns**:
  - Players must select a number following the **current pattern** with respect to the **top number** on the stack.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection Rules**:
   - **Unused Numbers**: Players can only select numbers that have not been used previously.
   - **Pattern Compliance**:
     - **Greater Than (>)**: The selected number must be **strictly greater** than the top number on the stack.
     - **Less Than (<)**: The selected number must be **strictly less** than the top number on the stack.

2. **Pattern Alternation**:
   - The pattern **alternates** after each turn, adding strategic depth.
   - The sequence of patterns is: **">"**, **"<"**, **">"**, **"<"**, etc.

3. **Invalid Moves and Loss Conditions**:
   - If a player has **no valid numbers** to play on their turn, they **lose the game**.
   - A move is invalid if:
     - The selected number does not satisfy the current pattern.
     - There are no unused numbers that satisfy the pattern.

4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends **immediately** when a player cannot make a valid move.
   - The other player is declared the **winner**.

5. **No Draws**:
   - The game is designed so that a draw is **impossible**.
   - With careful play, a skilled player can **consistently win**.

## Scoring

- **No Point System**:
  - There is **no scoring** or accumulation of points.
  - The outcome is simply a **win** or a **loss**.
- **Victory Determination**:
  - The winner is the player who successfully forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of both the numbers you need and the numbers your opponent may need.
- **Number Denial**: Sometimes it's strategic to select a number not only to make a valid move but also to prevent your opponent from having valid options on their next turn.
- **Pattern Awareness**: Always be mindful of the upcoming pattern change to anticipate future moves.
