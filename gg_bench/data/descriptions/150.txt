# Stone Pile Battle

## Objective

**Stone Pile Battle** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reduce your opponent's stone pile to zero.

The game ends when one player's stone pile reaches zero, resulting in their loss and the opponent's victory.

## Game Components

  - **Player 1's Stone Pile**: Starts at 15 stones.
  - **Player 2's Stone Pile**: Starts at 15 stones.
- **Actions**: Options available to players on their turn.
  - **Transfer Actions**: Strategies to manipulate stone counts.

## Turns

## Rules and Mechanics

### Allowed Actions

On your turn, you may choose **one** of the following actions:

1. **Self-Reduce and Transfer to Opponent**:

   - **Example**:

     - Add ⎣3 / 2⎦ = 1 stone to your opponent's pile.

2. **Attack Opponent's Pile and Steal Stones**:

     - Add ⎣2 / 2⎦ = 1 stone to your own pile.

### Additional Rules

  - You cannot remove more stones than are available in the pile you're targeting.
  - If the pile has fewer stones than the maximum allowed removal (3), you may only remove up to the number of stones remaining.
- **No Negative Stones**:
  - Stone piles cannot have negative values. Ensure that stone counts remain zero or positive after each action.
- **Game End Condition**:
  - The game ends immediately when **one player's stone pile reaches zero** at the end of any turn.
  - The player with zero stones **loses** the game.

## Scoring
