# Rule Book for "Divide and Conquer"

## Objective

**Divide and Conquer** is a strategic two-player turn-based game. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the **Current Number** to exactly **1** on your turn. Players take turns dividing the Current Number by valid divisors. Victory is achieved by making calculated moves that force your opponent into a position where they cannot win.

---

## Setup

1. **Initial Current Number**: Decide on a starting positive integer for the Current Number. This number should be greater than 1. For a standard game, it is recommended to start with **100**.

2. **Determine Turn Order**: Players decide who will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or randomly (e.g., flipping a coin).

3. **Game Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen divisors when prompted.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared positive integer that changes as the game progresses. It starts at the initial value set during setup (e.g., 100).

- **Valid Divisors**: Integers that meet the following criteria:
  - Greater than **1**.
  - Less than the Current Number.
  - Divides the Current Number evenly (no remainder).

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Announcement**: The game displays the Current Number and indicates which player's turn it is.
  2. **Player Action**: The active player selects a Valid Divisor and inputs it into the command-line interface.
  3. **Validation**: The game checks if the chosen divisor is valid.
     - If valid: The game proceeds to update the Current Number.
     - If invalid: The game prompts the player to choose a different divisor.
  4. **Update**: The Current Number is divided by the Valid Divisor, and the result becomes the new Current Number.
  5. **Turn End**: The turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

- **Passing a Turn**:
  - If a player cannot make a valid move because there are no Valid Divisors (e.g., the Current Number is prime), they pass their turn.
  - The opponent then takes their turn as usual.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Making a Move**:
   - On your turn, you **must** choose a Valid Divisor of the Current Number.
   - The divisor must satisfy all criteria of Valid Divisors.
   - Dividing the Current Number by the chosen divisor updates the Current Number.

2. **Valid Divisors**:
   - Must be an integer greater than 1 and less than the Current Number.
   - Must divide the Current Number evenly (without a remainder).
   - Example: If the Current Number is 18, valid divisors include 2, 3, 6, and 9.

3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Selecting a divisor that does not meet the Valid Divisor criteria is not allowed.
   - If an invalid divisor is chosen, the game will prompt the player to select again.

4. **Passing**:
   - If no Valid Divisors are available, the player must pass.
   - The opponent gets the opportunity to make the next move.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game is won by the player who reduces the Current Number to exactly **1** on their turn.
   - Reducing the Current Number below 1 is not possible due to the rules.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw.
   - Play continues until one player reduces the Current Number to 1.

7. **Extra Turns**:
   - It is possible for a player to have multiple consecutive turns if the opponent has to pass.

## Scoring

- **Single Match Victory**:
  - The winner is the player who reduces the Current Number to 1.

- **Multiple Rounds**:
  - Players may choose to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of games won by each player.
  - The player with the most victories after the decided number of rounds is the overall winner.

- **Tiebreakers**:
  - If playing multiple rounds and both players have the same number of victories, additional rounds can be played until a winner is determined.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Gameplay

**Initial Current Number**: 100

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 100
   - Valid Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
   - Player 1 chooses **25**.
   - Current Number is updated: 100 / 25 = **4**

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 4
   - Valid Divisors: 2
   - Player 2 chooses **2**.
   - Current Number is updated: 4 / 2 = **2**

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 2
   - No Valid Divisors (2 is prime, and there are no integers greater than 1 and less than 2).
   - Player 1 passes.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 2
   - Valid Divisors: 2
   - Player 2 chooses **2**.
   - Current Number is updated: 2 / 2 = **1**

- **Result**: Player 2 wins by reducing the Current Number to 1.

### Example 2: Forced Passing

**Initial Current Number**: 15

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 15
   - Valid Divisors: 3, 5
   - Player 1 chooses **5**.
   - Current Number is updated: 15 / 5 = **3**

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 3
   - No Valid Divisors (3 is prime).
   - Player 2 passes.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current Number: 3
   - Valid Divisors: 3
   - Player 1 chooses **3**.
   - Current Number is updated: 3 / 3 = **1**

- **Result**: Player 1 wins by reducing the Current Number to 1.

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

### Example of a Game Session

**Game Start**

```
Current Number is 100.
Player 1's turn.
Enter a Valid Divisor of 100: 25
Valid move. Current Number is now 4.

Current Number is 4.
Player 2's turn.
Enter a Valid Divisor of 4: 2
Valid move. Current Number is now 2.

Current Number is 2.
Player 1's turn.
No valid moves available. Player 1 passes.

Current Number is 2.
Player 2's turn.
Enter a Valid Divisor of 2: 2
Valid move. Current Number is now 1.

Player 2 wins the game!
```

### Invalid Move Handling

```
Current Number is 30.
Player 1's turn.
Enter a Valid Divisor of 30: 7
Invalid divisor. Please choose a Valid Divisor.

Enter a Valid Divisor of 30: 5
Valid move. Current Number is now 6.
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Prime Awareness**: Keep track of prime numbers. Forcing the Current Number to a prime on your opponent's turn can force them to pass.

- **Divisor Selection**: Choose divisors that lead to numbers with fewer Valid Divisors for your opponent.

- **Planning Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the Current Number you leave them.

- **Avoiding Passes**: Try not to reduce the Current Number to a prime unless it benefits you.
