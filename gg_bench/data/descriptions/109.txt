# Energy Duel: Rule Book

**Objective**

Become the first player to reduce your opponent's energy to **zero** by strategically managing your energy units through attacking and defending actions.

---

**Setup**

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Starting Energy**: Each player begins the game with **10 energy units**.
- **Game Start**: Determine which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

---

**Game Components**

- **Energy Units**: Numerical representation of a player's vitality and ability to perform actions. Each player starts with 10 energy units.
- **Actions**:
  - **Attack**: An offensive move to reduce the opponent's energy.
  - **Defend**: A protective move to mitigate damage from the opponent's next attack.
- **Tracking**: Players keep track of their own and their opponent's energy units throughout the game.

---

**Turns**

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Action Selection**: On their turn, a player chooses one action: **Attack** or **Defend**.
  2. **Energy Adjustment**: The chosen action affects energy units accordingly.
  3. **Status Update**: Update both players on the current energy levels.
- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Actions**:
   - **Attack**:
     - **Cost**: Consumes **2 energy units** from the attacker.
     - **Effect**: Reduces the opponent's energy by **3 units**.
   - **Defend**:
     - **Cost**: Consumes **1 energy unit** from the defender.
     - **Effect**: Reduces damage from the opponent's **next attack** by **2 units**.
     - **Note**: The defense effect is only applicable against the next attack and does not stack if multiple defenses are performed consecutively.
2. **Energy Management**:
   - Players cannot perform an action if they lack sufficient energy units to pay its cost.
   - A player's energy cannot drop below zero; any excess damage or cost is disregarded.
3. **Defend Mechanics**:
   - If a player defends and the opponent does not attack on their next turn, the defense effect expires.
   - Defense only applies to the immediate next attack.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player's energy is reduced to **zero**.
   - The player who reduces their opponent's energy to zero **wins the game**.

**Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**: Reduce your opponent's energy units to zero before they do the same to you.
- **No Points System**: The game is won by meeting the victory condition, not by accumulating points.

**Command-Line Interaction Example**

Below is a simplified version of how the game might look in a command-line interface.

```plaintext
--- Energy Duel ---
Player 1 Energy: 10
Player 2 Energy: 10

Player 1's Turn:
Choose your action:
1. Attack (Cost: 2 energy)

Player 2 Energy: 7

Player 2's Turn:
Choose your action:
1. Attack (Cost: 2 energy)
2. Defend (Cost: 1 energy)
Enter choice (1 or 2): 2
Player 2 defends!
Player 2 Energy: 6

Player 1's Turn:
Choose your action:
1. Attack (Cost: 2 energy)
2. Defend (Cost: 1 energy)
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1
Player 1 attacks!
Defense reduces damage by 2!

**Strategic Depth**

- **Energy Conservation**: Players must manage their limited energy resources to maximize damage while ensuring they have enough energy to continue performing actions.
- **Predictive Play**: Anticipating the opponent's moves (e.g., attacking when the opponent might defend) can provide a strategic advantage.
- **Defensive Timing**: Using the defend action at the right moment can significantly reduce incoming damage and alter the game's outcome.
- **Resource Denial**: Forcing the opponent into situations where they lack sufficient energy to attack can create openings for victory.

**Conclusion**

"Energy Duel" is a simple yet strategically rich game that can be easily implemented in a command-line interface. With straightforward mechanics and a clear objective, players can quickly learn the rules but will find depth in mastering the optimal balance between attacking and defending.
