In the "Maze Runner Duel" game, the action space indices map to directional moves as follows:

- **0:** Move Up
- **1:** Move Down
- **2:** Move Left
- **3:** Move Right 

These actions correspond to shifts in the 5x5 grid, where each move changes the player's position to an adjacent grid cell, following the specified direction.
