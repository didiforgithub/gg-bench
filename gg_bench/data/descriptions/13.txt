# **King's Line**

## **Objective**

Be the first player to move the King piece to your opponent's starting position. Utilize strategic movements and swaps to control the King along the linear board. The player who successfully brings the King to the opposing end wins the game.

## **Setup**

- **Board**: A linear board consisting of 7 numbered positions arranged sequentially from 1 to 7.
  
  ```
  Positions: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
  ```
  
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1 (P1)**: Places their Marker at **Position 1**.
  - **Player 2 (P2)**: Places their Marker at **Position 7**.
  - **King Piece (K)**: Placed at the center, **Position 4**.

The initial setup looks like this:

```
[ P1 ] [   ] [   ] [ K ] [   ] [   ] [ P2 ]
   1      2     3     4     5     6     7
```

## **Game Components**

- **Linear Board**: A simple row of 7 consecutive positions numbered from 1 to 7.

- **Markers**:
  - **Player Markers**:
    - **Player 1 Marker (P1)**: Represents Player 1's position on the board.
    - **Player 2 Marker (P2)**: Represents Player 2's position on the board.
  - **King Piece (K)**: The central piece that players aim to move to the opponent's starting position.

## **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.

- **Turn Actions**:
  - **Move Marker**: Move your Player Marker one position towards the King.
  - **Swap with King**: If your Player Marker is adjacent to the King, you may swap positions with the King.

- **Turn Progression**:
  1. **Player Action**: Choose to move or swap as per the rules.
  2. **Update Board**: Reflect the changes on the board.
  3. **Check for Win**: Determine if the game has been won.
  4. **Pass Turn**: Proceed to the opponent's turn.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **Movement Rules**

- **Moving Towards the King**:
  - On your turn, you may move your Player Marker **one position closer** to the King.
  - **Player 1** moves towards higher-numbered positions.
  - **Player 2** moves towards lower-numbered positions.

- **Swapping with the King**:
  - If your Player Marker is **adjacent** to the King, you may choose to **swap positions** with the King instead of moving.
  - Swapping places your Player Marker where the King was and moves the King towards your opponent.

- **Adjacency**:
  - Two pieces are adjacent if there is no other piece between them.
  - Positions are considered adjacent if their numerical difference is 1.

### **Movement Restrictions**

- **Occupied Positions**:
  - A Player Marker or the King cannot move into a position occupied by the other Player Marker.
  - Players cannot skip over the King or the other Player Marker.

- **Direction of Movement**:
  - Players must always move towards the King when moving their Marker.
  - Players cannot move away from the King unless swapping.

### **Winning the Game**

- **Victory Condition**:
  - A player wins by moving the King Piece to the opponent's starting position (Position 1 for Player 2 and Position 7 for Player 1).

- **No Draws**:
  - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player wins.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning**: Achieving the objective awards the player a win.

- **Tracking Wins**:
  - Keep count of the number of games won if playing multiple rounds.
