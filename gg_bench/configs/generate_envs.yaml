  <GameDescription>

  Given this description, write a gym environment that implements this game. Use gymnasium's API to define the environment. The action_space of the environment should be a Discrete space, use spaces.Discrete to define the action_space. The observation_space should be a Box space, use spaces. The reward should be 1 if the current player wins, and -10 if the current player has played a valid move. The environment should internally manage automatically switching between each player, it should be designed for self-play reinforcement learning.

  The environment should have the following methods:
  - `reset()`: Reset the environment to its initial state. Returns observation, info (dict).
  - `step(action)`: Take a step in the environment. Returns observation, reward, done, info (dict).
  - `render()`: Return a visual representation of the environment state as a string.
  - `valid_moves()`: Return a list of integers of valid moves as indices of the action_space.

  Here is an example of how to define the environment:
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  import gymnasium as gym
  from gymnasium import spaces


  class TicTacToeEnv(gym.Env):
      def __init__(self):
          super(TicTacToeEnv, self).__init__()

          # Define action and observation space
          self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(9)
          self.observation_space = spaces.Box(
              low=-1, high=1, shape=(9,), dtype=np.float32
          )

          # Initialize the board
          self.reset()

      def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
          super().reset(seed=seed)
          self.board = np.zeros(9, dtype=np.float32)
          self.current_player = 1
          self.done = False
          return self.board, {}  # Return observation and info

      def step(self, action):
          if self.board[action] != 0 or self.done:
              return (
                  self.board,
                  -10,
                  True,
                  False,
                  {},
              )  # Observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info

          self.board[action] = self.current_player

          # Check for win
          win_combinations = [
              [0, 1, 2],
              [3, 4, 5],
              [6, 7, 8],  # Rows
              [0, 3, 6],
              [1, 4, 7],
              [2, 5, 8],  # Columns
              [0, 4, 8],
              [2, 4, 6],  # Diagonals
          ]

          for combo in win_combinations:
              if all(self.board[i] == self.current_player for i in combo):
                  self.done = True
                  return self.board, 1, True, False, {}

          # Check for draw
          if np.all(self.board != 0):
              self.done = True
              return self.board, 0, True, False, {}

          self.current_player *= -1
          return self.board, 0, False, False, {}

      def render(self):
          board_str = "-------------\n"
          for i in range(3):
              board_str += "|"
              for j in range(3):
                  if self.board[i * 3 + j] == 1:
                      board_str += " X |"
                  elif self.board[i * 3 + j] == -1:
                      board_str += " O |"
                  else:
                      board_str += "   |"
              board_str += "\n-------------\n"
          return board_str

      def valid_moves(self):
          return [i for i in range(9) if self.board[i] == 0]
  ```

  Call the environment `CustomEnv`. Do not include any code that creates the gym environment or tests it. Make sure the environment is fully functional, requires no modifications and adheres to the requirements specified in the prompt. Do not include any placeholder functions or TODOs in the code.
