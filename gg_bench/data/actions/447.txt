The action space in the game is defined as a discrete space with two possible actions, indexed by integers: 0 and 1. Index 0 corresponds to the action 'charge', which increases the player's Charge Level by 1, up to a maximum of 5. Index 1 corresponds to the action 'attack', which deals damage to the opponent equal to the player's current Charge Level and then resets the Charge Level to 1.
