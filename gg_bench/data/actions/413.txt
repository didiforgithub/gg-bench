In the gym environment for the Beam Balance game, the action space is defined using `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which means it has 9 discrete actions corresponding to indices 0 through 8. These indices map directly to the 9 positions on the beam, which are numbered 1 through 9 in the game rules. Position 1 in the game corresponds to index 0 in the action space, position 2 to index 1, and so forth, up to position 9 corresponding to index 8. This mapping is a simple offset, where you add 1 to the zero-based index to get the position number on the beam.
