In the game, each action index corresponds to a possible movement distance on the number line. The action space is defined as a discrete space with three indices: 0, 1, and 2. Each index is mapped to a move as follows:

- **Action index 0**: Move forward 1 step.
- **Action index 1**: Move forward 2 steps.
- **Action index 2**: Move forward 3 steps.

Thus, the action index directly translates to the player's movement distance, where index 0 is a move of 1 step, index 1 is a move of 2 steps, and index 2 is a move of 3 steps.
