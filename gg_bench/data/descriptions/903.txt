   - A shared pool of numbers ranging from **2 to 50** is established. These numbers are unclaimed and available for selection.
   
2. **Starting Numbers**:
   - Both players begin with a **Current Number** of **1**.

3. **Player Designation**:
   - Determine who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**:
  - Numbers from **2 to 50** inclusive.
  - Represents the available numbers players can select during the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you must select a number from the pool that is a **multiple** of your **current number** (excluding 1).
     - The selected number must be greater than your current number unless your current number is 1.
   - The selected number becomes your new **current number**.
   - Remove the selected number from the pool.
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - You **cannot** select a number that is already removed from the pool.
   - If there are no valid multiples of your current number available in the pool, you lose your turn and the game.
   
3. **Special Notes**:
   - **Current Number Initialization**:
     - Both players start with a current number of **1**, allowing them to pick any number from the pool on their first turn.
   - **Selection Strategy**:
     - Choosing larger numbers may limit your future options. Plan ahead to avoid losing available moves.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - You win if your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
  - This occurs when there are no remaining numbers in the pool that are multiples of their current number.

- **Tracking Progress**:
  - Keep an eye on your current number and the remaining numbers in the pool to anticipate future moves.
