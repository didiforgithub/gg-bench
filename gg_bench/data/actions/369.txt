In the given Gym environment, the action space is represented by indices from 0 to `N_max`. Each action corresponds to a potential integer that can be subtracted from the current number \( N \) during a player's turn. However, the valid actions are only those indices that are proper divisors of \( N \) (excluding 1 and \( N \) itself). Choosing an index that is not a proper divisor or outside the valid range (greater than or equal to \( N \) or less than 2) results in an invalid move with a penalty. Proper divisors within the bounds of the action space allow progression in the game.
