In the game environment, the action space consists of indices that correspond to the list of prime numbers available at the start of the game. Each index in the action space represents a specific prime number from this list. When a player selects an action (i.e., an index), it maps to the prime number at that position in the list. During a turn, the player chooses an index corresponding to a valid prime number to subtract from the current number \( N \) in order to make a move.
