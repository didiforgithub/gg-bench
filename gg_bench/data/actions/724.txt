In the gym environment for the "Multiples Removal" game, the action space is defined using `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing the indices of the numbers on the 3x3 grid (0 to 8). Each index corresponds directly to a number on the grid, where index `0` maps to the number `1`, index `1` maps to the number `2`, and so on, up to index `8` mapping to the number `9`. A player selects an action by choosing an index, which represents selecting the corresponding number (index + 1) from the grid.
