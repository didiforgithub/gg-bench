# Multiplier Race

## Objective

Be the first player to reach or exceed a cumulative product of **1,000** by strategically multiplying the shared number with integers between **2** and **9**. The player who does so wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Initialize the Game**:
   - Set the **cumulative product** to **1**.
2. **Determine Turn Order**:
   - Decide which player goes first (e.g., flip a coin).

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Product**:
  - A shared number starting at **1**.
  - Updated each turn based on players' inputs.
- **Multipliers**:
  - Integers from **2** to **9**.
  - Used by players to multiply the cumulative product.
- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Players input their chosen multipliers.
  - Displays the current cumulative product and game status.

_No physical components are required; the game is played entirely through the command line._

## Turns

1. **Player's Action**:
   - On their turn, a player selects a multiplier between **2** and **9**.
   - Multiplier must be an integer within the valid range.
2. **Update Cumulative Product**:
   - Multiply the current cumulative product by the chosen multiplier.
   - The result becomes the new cumulative product.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After updating, the turn passes to the other player.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to bring the cumulative product to **1,000** or more wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players must choose a multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - Skipping a turn or passing is not allowed.
2. **Cumulative Product Update**:
   - Calculated as: `New Product = Current Product × Chosen Multiplier`.
3. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins immediately when the cumulative product reaches or exceeds **1,000** on their turn.
4. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw; a winner will always emerge.
5. **No Reverse Moves**:
   - Players cannot divide or reduce the cumulative product.
6. **Input Validation**:
   - If an invalid multiplier is entered, prompt the player to choose a valid number.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - Victory is achieved by reaching or surpassing the cumulative product of **1,000**.
- **No Point System**:
  - There is no point tally; focus is solely on achieving the objective.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Initial State:

- **Cumulative Product**: 1

#### **Turn 1**: Player 1

- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **5**.
- **Calculation**: `1 × 5 = 5`.
- **Cumulative Product**: Updated to **5**.

#### **Turn 2**: Player 2

- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **9**.
- **Calculation**: `5 × 9 = 45`.
- **Cumulative Product**: Updated to **45**.

#### **Turn 3**: Player 1

- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **9**.
- **Calculation**: `45 × 9 = 405`.
- **Cumulative Product**: Updated to **405**.

#### **Turn 4**: Player 2

- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **3**.
- **Calculation**: `405 × 3 = 1,215`.
- **Cumulative Product**: Updated to **1,215**.

#### **Result**:

- **Player 2 Wins**: Cumulative product is **1,215**, which is over **1,000**.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Cumulative product is 1
Player 1, choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 5
You chose 5.
New cumulative product is 5

Cumulative product is 5
Player 2, choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 9
You chose 9.
New cumulative product is 45

Cumulative product is 45
Player 1, choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 9
You chose 9.
New cumulative product is 405

Cumulative product is 405
Player 2, choose a multiplier between 2 and 9: 3
You chose 3.
New cumulative product is 1215

Player 2 wins! The cumulative product is 1,215.
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Anticipate the results of possible multipliers to control the cumulative product.
- **Forced Moves**:
  - Lead your opponent into situations where their options are limited.
- **Multiplier Selection**:
  - Higher multipliers increase the cumulative product quickly but can be risky.
  - Lower multipliers allow for more control over the game's pace.

## Summary

**Multiplier Race** is a simple yet strategic game where two players compete to be the first to reach a cumulative product of **1,000** or more by multiplying by numbers between **2** and **9**. The game emphasizes forward-thinking and the ability to predict and influence the game's progression, ensuring that skillful play is rewarded with consistent victories.
