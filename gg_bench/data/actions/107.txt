In the game environment, the action space indices (from 0 to 8) correspond directly to the numbers 1 through 9 from the number list. An action index `i` translates to removing the number `i + 1` from the list. For example, selecting action index 0 means removing the number 1, action index 1 means removing the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8 which removes the number 9. These indices allow players to make moves by specifying which number to remove based on its position in the sequence.
