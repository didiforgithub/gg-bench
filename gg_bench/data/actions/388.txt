In the provided gym environment, the action space indices directly correspond to the numbers that can be subtracted from the shared number, N. Each index in the action space (ranging from 0 to N_max) represents a possible subtraction move. However, only indices representing numbers within the valid range according to the game's rules can be used as valid subtractions. The permissible moves are constrained by whether the chosen number is a divisor or a multiple of the previously subtracted number. The action space spans the entire range of potential subtractions from 0 to N_max but only valid moves, as determined by the game logic, affect the game's progression without penalty.
