In the provided game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, meaning it consists of 9 discrete actions with indices ranging from 0 to 8. Each index corresponds to selecting a number from the range 1 to 9 in the game. The mapping is as follows: 

- Action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1.
- Action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2.
- ...
- Action index 8 corresponds to selecting the number 9.

This mapping works by taking the action index and adding 1 to convert it into the respective game number to be selected.
