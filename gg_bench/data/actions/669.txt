In the provided gym environment, the action space indices map directly to the indices of the prime numbers in `self.primes_list`. When a player selects an action (an index), it corresponds to choosing the prime factor at that index in `self.primes_list` to divide the current number `N`. The action space size is determined by the number of primes up to `self.prime_limit`, and each index represents a possible prime factor that can be chosen as a move in the game.
