**Game Name:** Number Eliminator

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player able to make a valid move by strategically crossing off numbers from a shared list according to the game's divisibility rules.

---

### **Setup**

- **Number List:** Write down a shared list of numbers from **1** to **9**.
  
  ```
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  ```

- **Starting Player:** Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., flip a coin or agree amicably).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number List:** A list containing the numbers **1** through **9**.
- **Turn Indicator:** An optional marker or simple notation to keep track of whose turn it is.
- **Cross-Off Mechanism:** A method to mark numbers as used (e.g., striking through numbers on paper or removing them from a digital list).

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Actions:**
  - **First Turn:** The starting player selects **any one number** from the shared list to cross off.
  - **Subsequent Turns:** Each player must select a number that is a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the **last number** their opponent chose.
- **Turn Progression:** The game continues with players alternating turns until one player cannot make a valid move.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Move:**
   - The first player may choose **any number** from the list to cross off.

2. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you **must** cross off a number that is either a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the **last number** your opponent selected.
   - The number **must be available** in the list (not already crossed off).

3. **Definitions:**
   - **Divisor:** A number that divides evenly into another number without leaving a remainder.
     - Example: **2** is a divisor of **4** because \( 4 \div 2 = 2 \) with no remainder.
   - **Multiple:** A number that can be obtained by multiplying another number by an integer.
     - Example: **8** is a multiple of **4** because \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \).

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - If a player cannot cross off any valid number on their turn (no numbers remaining are divisors or multiples of the last number chosen), they **lose** the game.
   - The **other player wins** by default.

5. **Additional Rules:**
   - **All numbers** crossed off remain out of play for the rest of the game.
   - **Players cannot pass;** they must make a move if a valid one is available.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winning Condition:** The winner is the player who successfully makes the last valid move.
- **No Points System:** The game does not involve point tracking; it is a win/lose outcome based on the ability to make a valid move.
