# Factor Chain

## Objective

**Be the last player able to add a number to the Factor Chain.**

In *Factor Chain*, two players take turns adding numbers to a chain following specific mathematical rules. The goal is to be the last player to make a valid move by strategically selecting numbers that extend the chain while limiting your opponent's options.

## Setup

1. **Starting Chain**: Begin the game with the chain containing only the number **1**.
2. **Number Pool**: Prepare a pool of numbers from **2** to **20**. Each number can be used only once in the game.
3. **Determine First Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin).

## Game Components

- **Chain**: A sequence of numbers that grows as players add valid numbers.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers **2** through **20**, available for players to select during their turns.
- **Players**: Two participants who alternate turns, referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.
2. **Action on Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: Choose an unused number from the number pool.
   - **Valid Move**: The selected number must be either a **factor** or a **multiple** of the **last number** in the chain.
   - **Add to Chain**: Place the selected number at the end of the chain.
3. **Proceeding Turns**: The next player repeats the action, using the updated chain and available numbers.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Numbers**:
  - **Factors**: Numbers that divide evenly into the last number of the chain (excluding 1 and the number itself if already used).
  - **Multiples**: Numbers that the last number of the chain divides evenly into.
- **Number Usage**:
  - **Single Use**: Once a number is added to the chain, it is removed from the number pool and cannot be selected again.
- **Ending the Game**:
  - **No Valid Moves**: If a player cannot find a valid number to add on their turn, they lose.
  - **Winning the Game**: The opposing player wins when their opponent cannot make a valid move.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who successfully adds a number when their opponent cannot make a valid move wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There are no points; the game outcome is win or loss per round.
- **Match Play**: Players can decide to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Example Gameplay

**Initial Setup**:

- Chain: `[1]`
- Number Pool: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}`

   - **Chain Now**: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]`
   - **Updated Number Pool**: `{3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20}`

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Last Number in Chain**: `16`
   - **Possible Choices**:
     - **Factors of 16**: `2` (used), `4` (used), `8` (used), `16` (used)
     - **Multiples of 16**: None within 2-20 that are unused
   - **No Valid Moves**: Player 1 cannot make a move and loses.
   - **Winner**: **Player 2**

## Strategic Considerations

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate which numbers will be available on your next turn based on the current chain.
- **Limit Opponent's Options**: Choose numbers that reduce the factors and multiples available for your opponent.
- **Control the Chain**: Aim to end your turn on a number with few factors or multiples remaining.
