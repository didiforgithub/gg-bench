The action space indices map to moves as follows:

- **Action 0**: Move forward by one position towards the opponent's home base.
- **Actions 1-9**: Place a block at the corresponding position (1 to 9) on the board if it's unoccupied and not a home base.
- **Actions 10-18**: Remove a block placed by the player from the corresponding position (positions 1-9) on the board. The action index is the position plus 9 (e.g., action 10 removes a block from position 1).
