In the action space of the game, each index corresponds to subtracting a specific prime number as follows: 

- Index 0: Subtracts the prime number 2
- Index 1: Subtracts the prime number 3
- Index 2: Subtracts the prime number 5
- Index 3: Subtracts the prime number 7

This mapping allows the player to select one of the four allowed prime numbers to subtract from the shared number on their turn.
