# Number Maze: A Strategic Race Game

## Objective

Be the first player to reach your opponent's starting corner by navigating through a numbered grid according to specific movement rules. Use strategic planning to outmaneuver your opponent and claim victory.

## Setup

1. **Game Grid Creation**:
   - Prepare a 4x4 grid, consisting of 16 cells.
   - Each cell is assigned a number from 1 to 4. These numbers are randomly distributed across the grid at the start of each game.

2. **Player Starting Positions**:
   - **Player 1** places their token on the **top-left corner** cell, designated as **Cell (1, 1)**.
   - **Player 2** places their token on the **bottom-right corner** cell, designated as **Cell (4, 4)**.

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Both players begin the game with their tokens on their respective starting cells.
   - The grid with numbers is visible to both players.

## Game Components

1. **Game Grid**:
   - A 4x4 grid labeled with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 4. Cells can be referenced using coordinates (Row, Column).

2. **Numbered Cells**:
   - Each cell contains a number between 1 and 4.
   - The number determines the exact number of steps a player must move when starting from that cell.

3. **Player Tokens**:
   - **Player 1 Token**: Represented by `P1`.
   - **Player 2 Token**: Represented by `P2`.

4. **Movement Directions**:
   - Allowed movements are in the four cardinal directions: **Up**, **Down**, **Left**, or **Right**.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns. **Player 1** starts the game.

2. **Turn Actions**:
   - On your turn, you **must move** your token according to the movement rules.

3. **Movement Execution**:
   - Determine the number on your **current cell**.
   - Move your token **exactly** that many steps in **one** of the four cardinal directions.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If you cannot make a legal move (e.g., moving off the grid or landing on the opponent's cell), you **lose** the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - **Step Count**: You must move **exactly** the number of steps indicated by the number on your current cell.
   - **Direction**: Choose **one** cardinal direction to move in for that turn.
   - **Path**: Your movement path is a straight line; you cannot change directions mid-move.

2. **Board Boundaries**:
   - You cannot move off the edges of the grid.
   - If a move would require you to go off the grid, the move is invalid.

3. **Occupied Cells**:
   - You cannot **land** on a cell currently occupied by your opponent.
   - You **can** move **through** a cell occupied by your opponent.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to land **exactly** on their opponent's starting cell **wins** the game.
   - If a player cannot make any valid moves on their turn, they **lose** the game.

5. **Stalemate**:
   - There is **no draw** mechanism. The game continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.

## Scoring

- The game is won by successfully reaching the opponent's starting cell or when the opponent cannot make a valid move.
- No points are tracked; it's a win/lose outcome per game.
- Players may choose to play multiple rounds and keep track of wins for extended play.

- **Control the Center**: Navigating through the center may offer more movement options.
- **Avoid Traps**: Be cautious of cells with high numbers near the edges, as they can limit your moves.
- **Block Your Opponent**: Position yourself to limit your opponent's movement options without violating the rules.
