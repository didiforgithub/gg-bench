# Grid Clash

## Objective

**Grid Clash** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a numerical grid. The primary objective is to claim the majority of the cells on the grid by the end of the game. Players capture cells by strategically selecting numbers and overtaking their opponent's adjacent cells. The player who controls more cells when all have been claimed wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, consisting of 9 cells.
2. **Number Assignment**: Each cell on the grid is assigned a unique number from 1 to 9. The numbers are randomly distributed across the grid at the start of the game.
3. **Player Tokens**: Each player selects a unique marker to represent their claimed cells (e.g., `X` for Player 1 and `O` for Player 2).
4. **Starting Player**: Decide which player takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Grid Cells**: Squares arranged in a 3x3 configuration, each containing a unique number from 1 to 9.
- **Numbers**: Integers from 1 to 9, each appearing exactly once on the grid.
- **Player Markers**: Symbols used to mark claimed cells on the grid (`X` and `O`).

### Grid Example (Initial State):

```
+---+---+---+
| 5 | 3 | 8 |
+---+---+---+
| 2 | 7 | 4 |
+---+---+---+
| 9 | 1 | 6 |
+---+---+---+
```

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- During a turn, a player performs the following actions:
  1. **Select a Cell**: Choose any unclaimed cell to claim.
  2. **Capture Check**: Determine if any opponent's adjacent cells can be captured based on the rules.
  3. **Update Grid**: Mark the selected cell (and any captured cells) with the player's marker.
- The game proceeds until all cells on the grid have been claimed.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Claiming Cells:

- On your turn, choose any unclaimed cell and mark it with your marker.

### Capturing Opponent's Cells:

- **Adjacent Cells**: Cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally next to the selected cell.
- **Capture Condition**: For each adjacent cell claimed by the opponent:
  - If the number in the newly claimed cell is **greater than** the number in the opponent's adjacent cell, you capture that cell.
  - Replace the opponent's marker with your own on any captured cells.

### Restrictions:

- You cannot select a cell that has already been claimed by either player.
- Captured cells are immediately converted and may trigger further strategic considerations but do not allow for chain captures in the same turn.

## Scoring

- **Game End**: The game concludes when all cells on the grid have been claimed.
- **Determining the Winner**:
  - Count the number of cells claimed by each player.
  - The player with the **most claimed cells** wins the game.
- **Tie-Breaker**:
  - If both players control an equal number of cells, the player with the **highest total sum** of their claimed cell numbers wins.
  - If still tied, the player who **claimed the highest numbered cell** wins.

### Capturing Cells

```
Player 2's Turn.
Enter the row (1-3) and column (1-3) of the cell you want to claim: 1 3
You claimed cell (1,3) with number 8.
You captured an opponent's cell at (1,2)!

## Strategy Tips

- **High-Value Cells**: Prioritize claiming cells with higher numbers to maximize your potential to capture opponent cells.
- **Protect Your Cells**: Be cautious when claiming low-numbered cells adjacent to unclaimed high-numbered cells; they may be easily captured.
- **Control the Center**: Holding central cells increases the number of opponent's cells you can potentially capture.
- **Anticipate Moves**: Consider which cells your opponent may aim for and plan your moves to counteract them.
