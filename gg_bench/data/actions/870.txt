In the game, the action space consists of 18 discrete actions. Each combination of a number and an operation maps to an action index:

- The numbers 1 to 9 each have two corresponding actions, one for addition and one for subtraction.
- The action index for moving to a number \( n \) and adding is \( (n - 1) \times 2 \).
- The action index for moving to a number \( n \) and subtracting is \( (n - 1) \times 2 + 1 \).

This mapping allows each action index to correspond uniquely to a specific move to a number on the circle and the choice of either adding or subtracting the value of that number from the current total.
