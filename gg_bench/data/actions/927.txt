In this gym environment for Factor Duel, the action space indices represent the potential proper divisors that a player can choose to subtract from the current number (N). Specifically, each index from 0 to `max_N` corresponds directly to an integer value, where an index `d` is a potential proper divisor if it satisfies the condition `d >= 2` and `d < N` and divides `N` exactly. If a player selects an index (action) that meets these criteria, it constitutes a valid move; otherwise, it is invalid.
