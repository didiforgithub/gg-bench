In the GridLock environment, the action space contains 20 discrete actions. Each action combines a move direction and a block placement option. The move direction is mapped to one of four cardinal directions: 0 for 'up', 1 for 'down', 2 for 'left', and 3 for 'right'. The block placement options range from -1 to 3, where -1 signifies no block placement, and 0 to 3 correspond to possible adjacent positions (up, down, left, right) relative to the player's current position. Each move direction can pair with five block placements (-1 to 3), resulting in 20 total actions: `move_direction * 5 + (block_direction + 1)`.
