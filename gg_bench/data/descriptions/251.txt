# Accumulator

## Objective

Accumulator is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly** the target total by adding numbers to a shared running total without exceeding it. Strategic selection of numbers and foresight are key to victory.

## Setup

1. **Target Total**: Decide on a target total that players will aim to reach. For a quick game, a target total of **23** is recommended.

2. **Starting Player**: Determine who will start first. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Numbers Available**: Integers from **1** to **9**.
  - Players will use these numbers to increment the running total.
  - Numbers can be reused any number of times by either player.

- **Running Total**: A shared cumulative total that starts at **0**.
  - This total increases as players add numbers during their turns.
  - The running total must not exceed the target total.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Input**: The current player selects a number between **1** and **9**.
  2. **Validation**: Ensure the chosen number does not cause the running total to exceed the target total.
  3. **Update**: Add the chosen number to the running total.
  4. **Display**: Show the updated running total to both players.
  5. **Check for Win/Loss**: Determine if the game has been won or lost.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, choose any integer between **1** and **9** (inclusive).
   - Numbers can be reused; there are infinite supplies of each number.

2. **Updating the Running Total**:

   - If the running total equals the target total after your addition, you **win**.
   - If the running total exceeds the target total, you **lose** immediately.

3. **Strategic Play**:
   - Anticipate future moves to force your opponent into a losing position.
   - Keep track of the running total to plan your moves accordingly.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Try to think several moves in advance to control the flow of the game.
- **Control the Running Total**: Aim to reach cumulative totals that force your opponent into a position where any move they make could cause them to lose.
- **Key Numbers**: Be aware of key running totals. For example, whatever total you want to force your opponent into, make sure you reach a cumulative total that is one less than a multiple of the number of options plus the target total.
