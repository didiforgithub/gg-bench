In the game environment for Number Removal Duel, the action space is represented by indices from 0 to 15, corresponding directly to the numbers 1 to 16 on the grid. Each index in the action space represents a move where the player selects and removes the number (index + 1) from the grid. Therefore, selecting an action at index `i` results in removing the number `i + 1` from the board.
