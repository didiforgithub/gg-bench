In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space indices range from `0` to `N-2`, which correspond to selecting numbers from `2` to `N` in the game. Each index `i` represents the number `i + 2`. For example, an action with index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, an action with index `1` corresponds to selecting the number `3`, and so on, up to the action with index `N-2`, which corresponds to selecting the number `N`. These indices map directly to available numbers in the game that players can choose to remove, following the rules of `Prime Deplete`.
