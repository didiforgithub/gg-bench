# Hidden Path

## Objective

Be the first player to successfully navigate the hidden path and reach **Step 10** without being sent back to the start by triggering your opponent's traps.

---

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A linear path consisting of steps numbered from **1** to **10**.
   
2. **Player Positions**: Both players start off the board at **Step 0** (before the first step).

3. **Traps Placement**:
   - Each player secretly selects **three distinct steps** between **1** and **10** to place traps on.
   - Players record their trap positions privately; these remain hidden from the opponent until triggered.

---

## Game Components

- **Path Steps**:
  - Numbered from **1** to **10**.
  - Represents the positions players move through to reach the objective.

- **Player Tokens (Optional)**:
  - Represent players' current positions on the path.
  - In a command-line interface, this can be tracked with simple variables.

- **Traps**:
  - Invisible to the opponent until triggered.
  - Each player has **three traps** placed on the path.
  - Once a trap is triggered, it becomes inactive and is revealed.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss, random selection).
   - Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.

2. **Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Move Forward**:
     - A player must move forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** steps from their current position.
     - Example: If on Step 0, possible moves are to Step 1, Step 2, or Step 3.
   
   - **Check for Traps**:
     - After moving, check if the new position is a trap set by the opponent.
     - If a trap is triggered, the player returns to **Step 0**, and the trap is revealed and deactivated.
     - If no trap is present, the player remains on the new step.
   
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The turn ends after the player moves and any traps are resolved.
   - The next player then takes their turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - Players must choose to move forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** steps.
   - Moves cannot skip over Step 10; players cannot move beyond it.
   - Exact landing on Step 10 is required to win.

2. **Traps**:
   - Each player has **three traps** placed secretly at the start.
   - Traps are only revealed when triggered.
   - Once a trap is triggered and revealed, it is removed from play.
   - Players cannot place multiple traps on the same step.

3. **Triggering a Trap**:
   - If a player lands on a step that is trapped by the opponent:
     - The player returns to **Step 0**.
     - The trap is revealed and deactivated.
     - The position of the trap is now known and safe for future moves.
   
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to land **exactly** on **Step 10** wins the game.
   - If a move would take a player beyond Step 10, that move is not allowed.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players must make a move on their turn; passing is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The winner is the first player to reach Step 10 exactly.
  
- **No Points System**:
  - The game is won by achieving the objective, not by accumulating points.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Initial Setup**:

- **Player 1's Traps**: Steps 4, 7, 9 (secret).
- **Player 2's Traps**: Steps 3, 6, 8 (secret).

---

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step 0.
  - Chooses to move **2 steps** to **Step 2**.
  - **No trap** triggered.
  
---

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step 0.
  - Chooses to move **3 steps** to **Step 3**.
  - Triggers **Player 1's trap** at Step 3 (not a trapped step for Player 1; misread, correcting).
  - Oops, in the initial setup, Player 1's traps are at 4, 7, 9.
  - **No trap** triggered.
  
---

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step 2.
  - Chooses to move **1 step** to **Step 3**.
  - **No trap** triggered.
  
---

**Turn 4**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step 3.
  - Chooses to move **3 steps** to **Step 6**.
  - Triggers **Player 1's trap** at **Step 6**.
  - **Player 2** returns to **Step 0**.
  - Trap at Step 6 is revealed and deactivated.

**Correction**: According to initial setup, Player 1's traps are at 4, 7, 9.

So, since Step 6 is not a trap set by Player 1, Player 2 should not trigger a trap there.

Rewriting Turn 4:

**Turn 4**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step 3.
  - Chooses to move **2 steps** to **Step 5**.
  - **No trap** triggered.

---

**Turn 5**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step 3.
  - Chooses to move **1 step** to **Step 4**.
  - Triggers **Player 2's trap** at **Step 4**.
  - **Player 1** returns to **Step 0**.
  - Trap at Step 4 is revealed and deactivated.

**Correction**: According to initial setup, Player 2's traps are at 3, 6, 8.

Therefore, Player 1's move to Step 4 should not trigger a trap.

Rewriting Turn 5:

**Turn 5**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step 3.
  - Chooses to move **2 steps** to **Step 5**.
  - **No trap** triggered.

---

**Turn 6**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step 5.
  - Chooses to move **1 step** to **Step 6**.
  - Triggers **Player 1's trap** at **Step 6**.
  - **Player 2** returns to **Step 0**.
  - Trap at Step 6 is revealed and deactivated.

Again, according to initial setup, Player 1's traps are at 4, 7, 9.

Step 6 is not a trap set by Player 1.

Similarly, Player 2's traps are at Steps 3, 6, 8.

Thus, when Player 2 moves to Step 6, Player 2 triggers their own trap? No. Players cannot trigger their own traps.

Given these inconsistencies, let's simplify and correct the example with accurate information.

**Correct Initial Setup**:

- **Player 1's Traps**: Steps **4**, **7**, **9** (secret).
- **Player 2's Traps**: Steps **3**, **6**, **8** (secret).

I'll proceed carefully.

---

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step **0**.
  - Moves **2 steps** to **Step 2**.
  - **No trap** triggered.

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step **0**.
  - Moves **3 steps** to **Step 3**.
  - Triggers **Player 1's trap** at **Step 3** (Player 1's traps are at 4, 7, 9, so no trap at Step 3).
  - But Step 3 is trapped by **Player 2** themselves (traps cannot affect their owner).
  - Therefore, **No trap** is triggered.

**Correction**: Players cannot trigger their own traps, so no trap is triggered.

---

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step **2**.
  - Moves **1 step** to **Step 3**.
  - **No trap** triggered.

---

**Turn 4**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step **3**.
  - Moves **2 steps** to **Step 5**.
  - **No trap** triggered.

---

**Turn 5**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: Step **3**.
  - Moves **3 steps** to **Step 6**.
  - Triggers **Player 2's trap** at **Step 6**.
  - **Player 1** returns to **Step 0**.
  - Trap at Step 6 is revealed and deactivated.

---

**Turn 6**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: Step **5**.
  - Moves **3 steps** to **Step 8**.
  - Triggers **Player 1's trap** at **Step 8** (no, Player 1's traps are at 4, 7, 9).
  - But Step 8 is trapped by **Player 2** themselves, which doesn't affect them.
  - **No trap** triggered.

---

**Turn 7**:

- **Player 1**:
  - Current Position: **Step 0**.
  - Moves **3 steps** to **Step 3**.
  - **No trap** triggered.

---

**Turn 8**:

- **Player 2**:
  - Current Position: **Step 8**.
  - Moves **2 steps** to **Step 10**.
  - **Player 2** reaches Step 10 and **wins the game**.

---

**Analysis**:

- **Player 2** successfully avoided Player 1's traps and reached Step 10 first.
- **Player 1** was set back by triggering a trap at Step 6, giving Player 2 the advantage.

## Strategic Tips

- **Trap Placement**:
  - Place traps on steps that are likely to be landed on based on common move options (e.g., multiples of common move totals).
  - Consider the opponent's possible paths and set traps accordingly.

- **Movement Choices**:
  - Vary your move distances to avoid predictability.
  - Keep track of revealed traps to plan safe routes.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Weigh the risk of landing on potential traps against the advantage of moving quickly.
