In the "Digit Duel" gym environment, the action space consists of two discrete actions represented by indices:

- **Action 0**: This corresponds to the move of 'keeping' the drawn digit, meaning the player adds the digit to their own hand if it isn't already full.
- **Action 1**: This corresponds to the move of 'giving' the drawn digit to the opponent, meaning the player passes the digit to the opponent, who must accept it unless their hand is full, in which case the digit is discarded.
