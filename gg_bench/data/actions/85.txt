In the game "Token Chase", the action space is defined as a discrete set of three possible actions, represented by the indices 0, 1, and 2. These indices map directly to the three possible moves a player can make on their turn. Specifically:

- Action index 0 corresponds to moving 1 position forward.
- Action index 1 corresponds to moving 2 positions forward.
- Action index 2 corresponds to moving 3 positions forward.

This mapping allows players to choose their move distance by selecting the appropriate action index during their turn.
