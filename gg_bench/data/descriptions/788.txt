# Target Sum - Rule Book

---

## Objective

**"Target Sum"** is a two-player, turn-based game where the goal is to be the first player to reach an exact total sum of **25** by selecting numbers from a shared pool. Players take turns picking numbers and adding them to their personal total. The first player to reach **exactly 25** wins. If a player's total exceeds **25**, they lose immediately. If all numbers are exhausted and neither player has reached **25**, the player with the higher total wins.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization**:
   - Create a common pool of numbers from **1** to **10**.
   - All numbers are available for selection at the start of the game.

2. **Player Totals**:
   - Both players begin with a personal total sum of **0**.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**:
  - A set of integers from **1** to **10**.
  - Represents the numbers available for selection.
  
- **Player Totals**:
  - Each player maintains their personal total sum.
  - Starts at **0** and increases as numbers are selected.

---

## Turns

- The game is turn-based, with players alternating turns.
- **Player 1** starts the game.
- On each turn:
  - The current player selects one number from the available pool.
  - The selected number is added to their personal total sum.
  - The selected number is then removed from the pool.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, you **must** select one number from the remaining numbers in the pool.
   - You cannot skip your turn or pass.

2. **Updating Total Sum**:
   - Add the selected number to your personal total sum.
   - Keep track of your total sum after each selection.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If, after your turn, your total sum is **exactly 25**, you win the game immediately.

4. **Exceeding 25**:
   - If your total sum **exceeds 25** after adding the selected number, you lose the game immediately.
   - The game ends, and your opponent wins.

5. **End of Number Pool**:
   - If all numbers have been selected and neither player has reached **25**:
     - The player with the **higher total sum** wins the game.
     - There are no ties; since the total sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is **55**, and both players cannot have the same total unless they reach 25.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw due to the mechanics of number selection and total sums.

- **Losing**:
  - Exceed a total of **25** points.
  - Have a lower total when all numbers are exhausted.

- **Tracking**:
  - Each player keeps a personal tally of their total sum.
  - The number pool is updated after each turn.

   - Player 2's total: 9 + 10 = **19**.
   - Number Pool: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **6**.
   - Player 1's total: 15 + 6 = **21**.
   - Number Pool: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Selects **5**.
   - Player 2's total: 19 + 5 = **24**.
   - Number Pool: 1, 2, 3, 4

## Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start**

```
Welcome to Target Sum!

Numbers available: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Player 1 total: 0

Player 2 total: 0
```

**Turn 1 - Player 1**

```
Player 1, select a number from the available pool: 8

You selected 8.

Your total sum is now 8.

Numbers remaining: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10
```

**Turn 2 - Player 2**

```
Player 2, select a number from the available pool: 9

You selected 9.

Your total sum is now 9.

Numbers remaining: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10
```

*(Gameplay continues in this manner until a player wins or loses.)*

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**:
  - Keep track of which numbers remain in the pool.
  - Calculate future totals to determine which numbers you'll need.

- **Blocking Opponent**:
  - Anticipate which numbers your opponent needs and select them first.
  - Force your opponent into a position where they must exceed 25 or cannot reach 25.

- **Resource Management**:
  - Balance taking high-value numbers to reach 25 quickly with not exceeding the limit.
  - Consider leaving specific numbers in the pool to create opportunities for yourself later.

---

## Examples of Strategy

- If your total is **15**, you need a combination of numbers that add up to **10** to reach 25.
  - Potential combinations: 6+4, 7+3, 5+5.
  - If key numbers are still available, plan to acquire them in future turns.

- If your opponent's total is **19**, they need a **6** to reach 25.
  - If the **6** is still in the pool, consider taking it to prevent their win.

---

## Ensuring No Draws

- Since the total sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 is **55**, and both players start from **0**, it's impossible for both players to reach 25 simultaneously.
- If both players cannot reach 25, the one with the higher total when all numbers are exhausted wins.
