# Sum Trap

## Objective

Be the first to force your opponent into a position where any available move will cause the cumulative total to reach or exceed **50**. The player who causes the total to reach or exceed 50 **loses** the game.

## Setup

1. **Cumulative Total**: Initialize the cumulative total to **0**.
2. **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers from **1** to **10**. Each number can be used only **once** per game.

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Total**: A running total of numbers added by both players, starting at 0.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers **1** through **10**, each available once per game.
- **Players**: Two players take turns selecting numbers from the number pool.

## Turns

1. **Determine First Player**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).
2. **Taking Turns**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
3. **Selecting a Number**:
   - On their turn, a player selects an available number from the number pool.
   - The selected number is added to the cumulative total.
   - The chosen number is then removed from the number pool.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players must select a number from the available numbers in the pool.
   - Each number from **1** to **10** can be selected only once during the game.
2. **Updating the Total**:
   - Add the selected number to the cumulative total immediately.
   - Announce or display the new cumulative total after each turn.
3. **Winning and Losing**:
   - **Objective**: Avoid being the player who causes the cumulative total to reach or exceed **50**.
   - **Winning**: If your opponent has no valid moves without reaching or exceeding **50**, you win.
   - **Losing**: If you select a number that brings the total to **50** or more, you lose.
4. **End of Game Conditions**:
   - The game ends immediately when the cumulative total reaches or exceeds **50**.
   - If all numbers have been used and the cumulative total is below **50**, the player who made the last move **loses** the game.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- The outcome is a straightforward **win** or **loss**.
