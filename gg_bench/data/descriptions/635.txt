# Power Play - A Two-Player Mathematical Strategy Game

## Objective

Be the **first player** to **reach or exceed the target number** by multiplying the current number by **2** or **3** on your turn.

- **Victory Condition:** The player who causes the current number to reach or exceed the target number wins the game.
- **Defeat Condition:** If your opponent reaches or exceeds the target number before you, you lose.

## Setup

1. **Choose the Target Number:** Players agree on a target number to play to (e.g., **100**).
2. **Starting Player:** Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
3. **Initial Current Number:** The game begins with the current number set to **1**.

## Game Components

- **Numbers Only:** The game is played using numbers and basic multiplication.
- **No Physical Pieces Required:** Ideal for a command-line interface or verbal play.
- **Optional Tools:** Paper and pencil or a calculator for keeping track of numbers (especially for large target numbers).

## Turns

- **Alternating Turns:** Players take turns one after the other.
- **Turn Actions:** On your turn, you must:
  1. **Choose a Multiplier:** Decide to multiply the current number by **2** or **3**.
  2. **Calculate the New Current Number:** Multiply and find the new current number.
  3. **Announce the Move:** State your chosen multiplier and the new current number.

### Example Turn Structure:

1. **Prompt:** "Player 1, multiply the current number by 2 or 3:"
2. **Player Input:** "I choose to multiply by 3."
3. **Calculation:** Current number \( \times \) 3.
4. **Announcement:** "The current number is now 3."

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Multipliers:** Only multiplication by **2** or **3** is allowed.
2. **Updating the Current Number:** Each move updates the current number for the next player's turn.
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If the **current number** reaches or exceeds the **target number** on your turn, you win.
   - The game ends immediately upon reaching or exceeding the target number.
4. **No Skipping Turns:** Players must make a move on their turn; passing is not allowed.
5. **No Additional Operations:** Addition, subtraction, division, or other multipliers are not permitted.
6. **Fair Play:** Players should perform and announce calculations accurately.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome:** There are no points; the game result is a win for one player and a loss for the other.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the nature of the winning condition.

## Examples

### Example Game with Target Number 100

**Game Start:**

- Target Number: **100**
- Current Number: **1**

**Turns:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - Chooses to multiply by **2**.
   - Calculation: \( 1 \times 2 = 2 \).
   - Announces: "I multiplied by 2. The current number is now **2**."

2. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - Chooses to multiply by **3**.
   - Calculation: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
   - Announces: "I multiplied by 3. The current number is now **6**."

3. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - Chooses to multiply by **2**.
   - Calculation: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \).
   - Announces: "I multiplied by 2. The current number is now **12**."

4. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - Chooses to multiply by **3**.
   - Calculation: \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \).
   - Announces: "I multiplied by 3. The current number is now **36**."

5. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - Chooses to multiply by **3**.
   - Calculation: \( 36 \times 3 = 108 \).
   - Announces: "I multiplied by 3. The current number is now **108**."

6. **End of Game:**

   - **Player 1 wins**, as the current number **108** is greater than the target number **100**.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead:** Anticipate future moves to force your opponent into a losing position.
- **Control Key Numbers:** Aim for current numbers that give you control over the game's progression.
- **Example Strategy:** If the target number is 100, try to reach numbers like 12, 18, 27, or 54 on your turn, which can strategically benefit you in the long run.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
Game Start
-----------
Target Number: 100
Current Number: 1

Player 1's Turn:
Multiply the current number by 2 or 3: 2
Player 1 multiplied by 2. Current number is now 2.

Player 2's Turn:
Multiply the current number by 2 or 3: 3
Player 2 multiplied by 3. Current number is now 6.

Player 1's Turn:
Multiply the current number by 2 or 3: 2
Player 1 multiplied by 2. Current number is now 12.

Player 2's Turn:
Multiply the current number by 2 or 3: 3
Player 2 multiplied by 3. Current number is now 36.

Player 1's Turn:
Multiply the current number by 2 or 3: 3
Player 1 multiplied by 3. Current number is now 108.

Player 1 wins! The current number 108 has reached or exceeded the target number 100.
```

## Tips for Players

- **Memorize Key Multiplication Results:** Knowing the results of multiplying by 2 and 3 can speed up your play.
- **Time Management:** If playing with a time limit per turn, plan your moves quickly to avoid penalties.
- **Adjusting Difficulty:** For a shorter game, choose a smaller target number; for a longer and more challenging game, select a larger target number.

## Optional Rules

- **Time Limit Per Turn:**

  - Players may agree on a time limit (e.g., **30 seconds**) for each turn to keep the game fast-paced.
  - Exceeding the time limit results in a forfeit of the turn or loss of the game, as agreed upon before starting.

- **Varying Multipliers:**

  - For additional complexity, players may agree to allow different sets of multipliers (e.g., **2 and 4**, or **3 and 5**).
  - Ensure both players agree and understand the new multipliers before starting the game.

## Ensuring Fair Play and Competitiveness

- **Skill Development:** Practice mental calculations to improve your chances of winning.
- **Strategic Depth:** Analyze possible future moves and their implications for both players.
- **Consistent Application of Rules:** Adhering strictly to the rules ensures a fair and enjoyable game for both players.
