## Rules and Mechanics

### Revealing a Card

- **Procedure**:
  1. Choose a face-down card numbered **1** to **5**.
  2. Reveal the card's identity to both players.

- **Possible Outcomes**:
  - **If the card is a Lock or Key**:
    - The player adds the card to their hand.
    - The player cannot hold more than one Lock or one Key; if they already hold the same type of card, they must leave it face-up in its position.
  - **If the card is the Treasure**:
    - **If the player holds both a Lock and a Key**:
      - The player wins the game.
    - **If the player does not hold both a Lock and a Key**:
      - The Treasure card is shown to both players and then placed back face-down in the same position.
  - **After Revealing**:
    - If the revealed card was not taken into the player's hand (i.e., the Treasure or an extra Lock/Key), it remains face-up in its position for the remainder of the game.

### Swapping Cards

- **Procedure**:
  1. Choose any two face-down cards numbered **1** to **5**.
  2. Swap the positions of these two cards without looking at them.

- **Rules**:
  - Players cannot swap face-up cards.
  - Players are not allowed to peek at the cards during or after the swap.
  - Swapping adds an element of uncertainty and strategy, potentially disrupting the opponent's memory of card positions.

### Holding Cards

- **Hand Limitations**:
  - A player may hold **only one Lock** and **one Key** at a time.
  - If a player reveals a Lock or Key but already holds that type of card, they cannot take it into their hand; the card remains face-up on the table.

### Winning the Game

- To win, a player must:
  1. Hold **one Lock** and **one Key** in their hand.
  2. Successfully reveal the **Treasure** card on their turn.

- **Note**:
  - Simply holding both a Lock and a Key is not enough; the Treasure must be revealed by that player while holding both items.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - The first player to meet the winning conditions is declared the winner.

- **No Points System**:
  - There is no cumulative point scoring; the game is won by achieving the objective.

  Cards:     [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  ```

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Outcome**:
  - Cards at positions 1 and 4 are swapped without being revealed.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action**: Reveals card at position 2.
- **Outcome**:
  - Card at position 2 is the **Treasure**.
  - Player 2 does **not** hold both a Lock and a Key.
  - The Treasure card is shown to both players and placed back face-down at position 2.

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Action**: Reveals card at position 1 (originally at position 4 due to swap).
- **Outcome**:
  - Card at position 1 is the **Treasure** (due to previous swap).
  - Player 1 holds a **Key** but no **Lock**.
  - The Treasure card is placed back face-down at position 1.

#### Turn 6: Player 2

  - Since it's face-up, Player 1 sees it's a Lock but cannot take it (Player 2 already holds it).

#### Turn 8: Player 2

- **Action**: Reveals card at position 2.
- **Outcome**:
  - Card at position 2 is the **Treasure**.
  - Player 2 holds both a **Lock** and a **Key**.

## Strategic Tips

- **Memory**: Keep track of the positions of the Treasure, Locks, and Keys as they are revealed or swapped.
- **Swapping**: Use swapping to confuse your opponent or to reposition the Treasure to a location advantageous to you.
- **Anticipation**: Predict your opponent's moves based on their actions to stay one step ahead.
- **Resource Management**: Since you can hold only one Lock and one Key, plan your reveals accordingly.

## Conclusion

**Lock and Key** is a game of memory, strategy, and deduction. By carefully choosing whether to reveal or swap cards each turn, players can outwit their opponent and be the first to unlock the treasure. Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
