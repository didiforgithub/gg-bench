The action space indices in the game represent each square on the 5x5 grid board, flattened into a 1D array. Specifically, index 0 corresponds to square A1, index 1 corresponds to square A2, continuing row-wise to index 24, which corresponds to square E5. Thus, the index `i` in the 1D array maps directly to the square in the 5x5 grid using the formula: square(row, column) corresponds to index `row * 5 + column`. Here, rows and columns are zero-indexed, meaning row 0 corresponds to the top row (1) and column 0 corresponds to the leftmost column (A).
