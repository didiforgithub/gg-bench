# Divisible Duel: Rule Book

Welcome to **Divisible Duel**, a strategic two-player turn-based game designed for play in a command-line interface. Sharpen your numerical skills and outwit your opponent in a race to create a number divisible by a target value without falling into forbidden traps.

---

## Objective

The primary goal of **Divisible Duel** is to be the first player to create a shared number that is **divisible by the target number** (which is **7** by default). Players take turns appending digits to the end of a growing number, carefully avoiding making the number divisible by any forbidden numbers. The player who successfully makes the number divisible by the target number **wins the game**. Conversely, if a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they **lose the game**.

---

## Setup

1. **Initial Number**: The game starts with a shared number initialized to **0**.
2. **Target Number**: The target divisor is set to **7**.
3. **Forbidden Numbers**: The forbidden divisors are **2**, **3**, and **5**.
4. **Digit Pool**: Digits from **1** to **9** are available for both players to use throughout the game.
5. **Starting Player**: Determine who goes first (Player 1) by mutual agreement or random selection.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A number that both players build upon during the game. It starts at `0` and grows as digits are appended.
  
- **Digit Pool (1-9)**: The digits that players can choose from on their turn to append to the shared number.

- **Target Number (7)**: The number that players aim to make the shared number divisible by to win the game.

- **Forbidden Numbers (2, 3, 5)**: Numbers by which the shared number must **not** be divisible after a player appends a digit.

- **Player Indicators**: Simply labeled as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Select a Digit**: Choose a digit from `1` to `9`.
  2. **Append the Digit**: Add the selected digit to the right end of the shared number.
  3. **Validate the Move**:
     - Ensure that the new shared number is **not divisible** by any of the forbidden numbers (`2`, `3`, or `5`).
     - Check if the new shared number is **divisible by the target number** (`7`).
  4. **End Turn**: If the game hasn't ended, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Appending Digits**:
   - On each turn, a player must append **one digit** (`1`-`9`) to the shared number.
   - Digits can be reused; there are no limits on how many times a digit can be used in the game.

2. **Forbidden Divisibility**:
   - After appending a digit, the new shared number **must not** be divisible by **`2`**, **`3`**, or **`5`**.
   - If appending any digit would cause the shared number to be divisible by a forbidden number, the player **loses** the game.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - If after appending a digit, the shared number is **divisible by the target number** (`7`) **without** being divisible by any forbidden numbers, the player **wins** the game.

4. **No Valid Move**:
   - If a player has **no valid digit** to append (all choices result in a number divisible by a forbidden number), they **lose** the game.

### Special Mechanics

- **Shared Knowledge**: Both players can see the current shared number and must plan their moves accordingly.

- **Strategic Play**: Players must anticipate future moves, considering how their appended digit affects the next player's options.

- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; a win or loss will occur based on the rules above.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The winner is the player who first creates a shared number divisible by the **target number** (`7`) without violating the forbidden divisibility rules.

- **Losing the Game**:
  - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.
  - A player loses if they violate the forbidden divisibility rules after appending a digit.

- **No Point System**: There are no points to track; the game outcome is determined solely by the win/loss condition.

## Examples

Below are example scenarios and command-line interactions to illustrate how the game is played.

### Example Game

#### Initial State

- **Shared Number**: `0`
- **Player 1's Turn**

#### Turn 1: Player 1

1. **Selects Digit**: `1`
2. **Appends Digit**: Shared number becomes `1`.
3. **Validation**:
   - `1` is not divisible by `2`, `3`, or `5`.
   - `1` is not divisible by `7`.
4. **Turn Ends**: Valid move. Turn passes to Player 2.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

1. **Selects Digit**: `4`
2. **Appends Digit**: Shared number becomes `14`.
3. **Validation**:
   - `14` is divisible by `7`.
   - `14` is divisible by `2` (forbidden).
4. **Result**: Move invalid. Player 2 **loses** the game.

#### Game Outcome

- **Winner**: Player 1
- **Reason**: Player 2 created a number divisible by a forbidden number (`2`).

### Additional Scenario

#### Continuing from Turn 1

Assuming Player 1's move resulted in a shared number of `1`.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

1. **Selects Digit**: `3`
2. **Appends Digit**: Shared number becomes `13`.
3. **Validation**:
   - `13` is not divisible by `2`, `3`, or `5`.
   - `13` is not divisible by `7`.
4. **Turn Ends**: Valid move. Turn passes to Player 1.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

1. **Selects Digit**: `9`
2. **Appends Digit**: Shared number becomes `139`.
3. **Validation**:
   - `139` is not divisible by `2`, `3`, or `5`.
   - `139` is not divisible by `7`.
4. **Turn Ends**: Valid move. Turn passes to Player 2.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

1. **Selects Digit**: `7`
2. **Appends Digit**: Shared number becomes `1397`.
3. **Validation**:
   - `1397` is not divisible by `2`, `3`, or `5`.
   - `1397` divided by `7` equals `199.571428...` (not a whole number).
4. **Turn Ends**: Valid move. Turn passes to Player 1.

#### Turn 5: Player 1

1. **Selects Digit**: `0` (invalid choice since digits `1`-`9` only)
   - **Note**: Digits must be between `1` and `9`. Player 1 must select a valid digit.

2. **Selects Digit**: `1`
3. **Appends Digit**: Shared number becomes `13971`.
4. **Validation**:
   - `13971` is divisible by `3` (forbidden).
5. **Result**: Move invalid. Player 1 **loses** the game.

#### Game Outcome

- **Winner**: Player 2
- **Reason**: Player 1 created a number divisible by a forbidden number (`3`).

## Strategies and Tips

- **Avoid Forbidden Traps**: Before selecting a digit, calculate whether the new number will be divisible by `2`, `3`, or `5`.

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider how your move will limit or expand your opponent's options on their next turn.

- **Target Divisibility**: Keep track of how close the current number is to being divisible by the target number (`7`). Use this to your advantage.

- **Digit Selection**: Sometimes, selecting a less obvious digit can create a difficult situation for your opponent.
