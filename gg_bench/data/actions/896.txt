The action space consists of 29 discrete actions:

- **Actions 0-3**: These correspond to movement actions for the player's token:
  - **0**: Move Up
  - **1**: Move Down
  - **2**: Move Left
  - **3**: Move Right

- **Actions 4-28**: These correspond to placing an obstacle on the grid:
  - Each integer from **4** to **28** represents placing an obstacle at a specific cell on the 5x5 grid. 
  - The calculation is based on zero-indexed row and column positions: `row = (action - 4) // 5` and `col = (action - 4) % 5`, mapping to cells from `A1` to `E5`.
