# Fifty!

## Objective

Be the player who brings the shared total sum to **exactly 50** by strategically choosing numbers from a limited set. Use careful planning and foresight to outmaneuver your opponent and achieve the target sum without exceeding it.

---

## Setup

1. **Initial Total Sum**: The game starts with a total sum of **0**.
2. **Available Numbers**: A list of integers from **1 to 9** is presented. Each number can be used **only once** during the game.
3. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly (e.g., flipping a coin) or by mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Total Sum**: A shared running total that both players contribute to during the game.
- **Number Pool**: The set of numbers **1 through 9**, each of which can be selected only once.
- **Players**: Two players alternate turns, strategically selecting numbers from the pool.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Sequence**: Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.
2. **Action on Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: Choose any available number from the number pool (numbers 1-9 that haven't been used).
   - **Update Total Sum**: Add the selected number to the total sum.
   - **Remove Number**: Mark the selected number as used so it cannot be chosen again.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Numbers**:
   - Numbers must be selected from the current list of **available numbers**.
   - Each number from **1 to 9** can be selected **only once** during the game.

2. **Updating Total Sum**:
   - After a number is selected, it is **added** to the shared total sum.
   - Keep track of the total sum after each turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who brings the total sum to **exactly 50** **wins** the game.

4. **Exceeding the Total Sum**:
   - If a playerâ€™s move causes the total sum to **exceed 50**, that player **immediately loses** the game.

5. **All Numbers Used**:
   - If all numbers from **1 to 9** have been used and the total sum has **not** reached 50:
     - The player with the total sum **closest to 50 without exceeding it** **wins**.
     - If both players have the same total sum, the **last player to make a move wins**.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game is designed to **eliminate the possibility of a draw** through the tie-breaking rule when all numbers are used.

---

## Scoring

- **Win**: Successfully bring the total sum to exactly 50, or have the closest total sum to 50 without exceeding it when all numbers are used.
- **Loss**: Cause the total sum to exceed 50, or have a lower total sum when all numbers are used.

## Examples

### Example 1: Reaching Exactly 50

**Initial Total Sum**: 0  
**Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1** selects **9**.
   - Total Sum: 0 + 9 = **9**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
2. **Player 2** selects **8**.
   - Total Sum: 9 + 8 = **17**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
3. **Player 1** selects **7**.
   - Total Sum: 17 + 7 = **24**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
4. **Player 2** selects **6**.
   - Total Sum: 24 + 6 = **30**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
5. **Player 1** selects **5**.
   - Total Sum: 30 + 5 = **35**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4
6. **Player 2** selects **4**.
   - Total Sum: 35 + 4 = **39**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3
7. **Player 1** selects **3**.
   - Total Sum: 39 + 3 = **42**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2
8. **Player 2** selects **2**.
   - Total Sum: 42 + 2 = **44**
   - Available Numbers: 1
9. **Player 1** selects **1**.
   - Total Sum: 44 + 1 = **45**
   - Available Numbers: None

**Result**:

- All numbers have been used.
- Total Sum: **45**
- Neither player reached 50.
- **Player 1** wins as they were the last to make a move.

### Example 2: Exceeding 50

**Initial Total Sum**: 0  
**Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1** selects **9**.
   - Total Sum: 0 + 9 = **9**
2. **Player 2** selects **9** (Invalid move; 9 has been used).
   - **Player 2** selects **8** instead.
   - Total Sum: 9 + 8 = **17**
3. **Player 1** selects **7**.
   - Total Sum: 17 + 7 = **24**
4. **Player 2** selects **6**.
   - Total Sum: 24 + 6 = **30**
5. **Player 1** selects **5**.
   - Total Sum: 30 + 5 = **35**
6. **Player 2** selects **7** (Invalid move; 7 has been used).
   - **Player 2** selects **9** (Invalid move; 9 has been used).
   - **Player 2** selects **10** (Invalid; number not in pool).
   - **Player 2** selects **15** (Invalid; number not in pool).
   - **Player 2** selects **4**.
   - Total Sum: 35 + 4 = **39**
7. **Player 1** calculates that adding **6** would cause the total to exceed 50 (39 + 6 = 45), safe to proceed.
   - **Player 1** selects **6**.
   - Total Sum: 39 + 6 = **45**
8. **Player 2** has the only options of selecting **1, 2, or 3**.
   - Selecting any of these will not reach 50.
   - **Player 2** selects **5** (Invalid; 5 has been used).
   - Corrects to **Player 2** selects **3**.
   - Total Sum: 45 + 3 = **48**
9. **Player 1** selects **2**.
   - Total Sum: 48 + 2 = **50**

**Result**:

- **Player 1** wins by bringing the total sum to exactly **50**.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of the numbers your opponent is likely to choose and plan your selections accordingly.
- **Control the Game**: Try to force your opponent into a position where any move they make will lead to their loss.
- **Counting**: Regularly calculate the remaining total needed to reach 50 and consider which available numbers can get you there.
