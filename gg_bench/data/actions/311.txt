The action space indices (0-17) map to moves in the game by representing combinations of digits and placement positions. Each index encodes a move, where the integer division of the index by 2 gives the digit (1 to 9), and the remainder determines the placement: even indices (0, 2, 4, ... 16) correspond to placing the digit at the "front," while odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., 17) correspond to placing the digit at the "back."
