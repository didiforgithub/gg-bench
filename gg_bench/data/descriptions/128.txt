# Math Maze

## Objective

Be the first player to reach exactly the **Target Number** by strategically adding or multiplying your current score. Plan your moves carefully to avoid exceeding the target and losing the game.

## Setup

- **Target Number**: A randomly selected number between **15** and **25** (inclusive). This number is agreed upon before the game starts. For example, the Target Number is **20**.
- **Current Scores**: Both players start with a **Current Score** of **0**.
- **Players**: Two players decide who will take the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Target Number**: The goal that players aim to reach exactly.
- **Current Scores**: Each player maintains their own Current Score, starting at **0**.
- **Allowed Operations**:
  - **Addition**: Add **1** to your Current Score.
  - **Multiplication**: Multiply your Current Score by **2**.

## Turns

Players take turns alternately. On each turn, a player must perform **one** of the allowed operations on their Current Score:

1. **Add 1** to their Current Score.
2. **Multiply** their Current Score by **2**.

After performing the operation, the new Current Score is announced.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Allowed Operations

- **Addition**:
  - You may add **1** to your Current Score.
- **Multiplication**:
  - You may multiply your Current Score by **2**.

### Winning and Losing Conditions

- **Winning**:
  - If you reach **exactly** the Target Number on your turn, you win the game.
- **Losing**:
  - If your Current Score **exceeds** the Target Number after your turn, you immediately lose the game.

### Restrictions

- The Current Score must always be a **non-negative integer**.
- You cannot skip a turn; you must perform one of the allowed operations.

## Scoring

- This is a **win-or-lose** game.
- **No points** are tracked beyond the Current Scores and the Target Number.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Target Number**: 20

#### Starting the Game

- **Player 1** Current Score: 0
- **Player 2** Current Score: 0

#### Turn Sequence

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New Current Score: **0 + 1 = 1**
2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New Current Score: **0 + 1 = 1**
3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New Current Score: **1 × 2 = 2**
4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New Current Score: **1 + 1 = 2**
5. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New Current Score: **2 × 2 = 4**
6. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New Current Score: **2 × 2 = 4**
7. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
   - New Current Score: **4 × 2 = 8**
8. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New Current Score: **4 + 1 = 5**
9. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses to **add 1**.
   - New Current Score: **8 + 1 = 9**
10. **Player 2's Turn**
    - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
    - New Current Score: **5 × 2 = 10**
11. **Player 1's Turn**
    - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
    - New Current Score: **9 × 2 = 18**
12. **Player 2's Turn**
    - Chooses to **multiply by 2**.
    - New Current Score: **10 × 2 = 20**
    - **Player 2** reaches the Target Number and **wins** the game.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.
- **Balancing Operations**: Decide when to add and when to multiply to reach the Target Number efficiently.
- **Avoiding Overreach**: Be cautious not to exceed the Target Number, which results in an immediate loss.

## Ensure Strategic Depth and Complexity

"Math Maze" offers strategic depth despite its simple rules. Players must:

- **Calculate Outcomes**: Think ahead about the results of each operation.
- **Predict Opponent Moves**: Anticipate and counter the opponent's strategy.
- **Optimize Moves**: Choose the most effective sequence of operations to reach the Target Number first.

## Summary

"Math Maze" is an engaging and strategic game suitable for a command-line interface. Its simplicity makes it easy to code and understand, yet it provides enough complexity to challenge players' planning and decision-making skills. With no possibility of a draw and quick gameplay, it satisfies all the desired criteria for an enjoyable two-player turn-based game.
