In the game, each square on the 4x4 grid is represented by an index in the action space ranging from 0 to 15. This corresponds to the grid positions as follows: index 0 represents A1, index 1 represents A2, continuing in row-major order, where 4 is B1, 5 is B2, and so on, up to index 15 which represents D4. This means the action space index is calculated by `(row_number - 1) * 4 + (column_index)`, where rows are numbered 1 to 4 and columns are numbered A (0), B (1), C (2), D (3). Thus, each action translates directly to a particular grid cell the Knight can move to.
