The action space consists of 70 discrete actions, each representing a combination of a movement choice and an observation choice. The first element (movement_choice) is determined by dividing the action index by 7, while the second element (observation_choice) is the remainder plus 1. The movement choices are mapped as follows: 

- 0: Move Left,
- 1: Move Right,
- 2: Stay,
- 3 to 9: Quantum Tunneling to positions 1 to 7.

For example, an action index of 15 translates to movement_choice 15 // 7 = 2 (Stay) and observation_choice (15 % 7) + 1 = 2.
