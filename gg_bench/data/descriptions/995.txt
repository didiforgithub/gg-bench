**Prime Total**

**Rule Book**

---

### **Objective**

**Primary Goal:**  
In **Prime Total**, two players compete by alternately adding numbers to a shared total sum. The main objective is to avoid making the total sum a prime number. The first player who causes the total sum to become a prime number **loses** the game. Victory is achieved by strategically adding numbers to force the opponent into making the total sum prime on their turn.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Initial Total Sum:**  
   - The game begins with a total sum of **0**.
  
2. **Player Designation:**  
   - Determine which player goes **first** (Player 1) and which goes **second** (Player 2). This can be decided by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

3. **Available Numbers:**  
   - Both players have access to numbers **1** through **10** inclusive. These numbers can be used multiple times throughout the game.

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Shared Total Sum:**  
   - A number representing the cumulative sum of all numbers added by both players during the game.
   - **Functionality:** Tracks the progress of the game and determines when a player loses.

2. **Number Selection (1-10):**  
   - Players choose from integers **1** to **10** on their turn.
   - **Attributes:**
     - Each number is available for selection on every turn.
     - Numbers can be reused multiple times by either player.

3. **Command-Line Interface:**  
   - The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen numbers.
   - **Functionality:** Facilitates the game by accepting player inputs and displaying the current total sum after each turn.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players take **alternate turns** starting with Player 1.
   - On each turn, the player performs the following actions:
     1. **Select a Number:** Choose a number between **1** and **10** inclusive.
     2. **Add to Total Sum:** Add the selected number to the shared total sum.
     3. **Check for Prime Total:** Determine if the new total sum is a prime number.

2. **Turn Progression:**
   - After a player completes their turn, the next player proceeds with their turn following the same steps.
   - The game continues until a player causes the total sum to be a prime number.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection Rules:**
   - On their turn, a player **must** choose a number between **1** and **10** inclusive.
   - **No Restrictions** on reusing numbers; any number can be chosen regardless of previous selections.

2. **Adding to Total Sum:**
   - The chosen number is added to the current total sum to form a new total sum.
   - Example: If the current total sum is **7** and the player adds **4**, the new total sum becomes **11**.

3. **Prime Number Check:**
   - After adding the chosen number, the player must check if the new total sum is a **prime number**.
     - **Prime Number Definition:** A natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - If the total sum is **prime**, the player who made the move **loses** immediately.
   - If the total sum is **not prime**, the game continues to the next player's turn.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player **wins** when their opponent adds a number that causes the total sum to become a prime number.

5. **Losing the Game:**
   - A player **loses** when they add a number that results in the total sum being a prime number.

6. **Continued Play:**
   - The game continues indefinitely until a player loses.
   - There is **no draw** condition in this game.

### **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition:**
  - The game is won by **direct elimination**, not by accumulating points.
  - The player who avoids making the total sum prime and forces their opponent to cause a prime total sum **wins**.
  
- **No Point Tracking:**
  - There is no scoring system or points to track.
  - Focus is on strategic play to avoid losing conditions.

### **Examples**

Below are example scenarios to illustrate how the game is played in practice using command-line interactions.

#### **Example Game Play**

---

**Starting the Game:**

- **Total Sum:** 0

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Action:** Chooses number **4**.
- **Calculation:** 0 (current total sum) + 4 = **4**.
- **Prime Check:** 4 is **not prime**.
- **Output:**
  ```
  Player 1 adds 4. Total sum is now 4.
  ```

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Action:** Chooses number **5**.
- **Calculation:** 4 + 5 = **9**.
- **Prime Check:** 9 is **not prime**.
- **Output:**
  ```
  Player 2 adds 5. Total sum is now 9.
  ```

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Action:** Chooses number **2**.
- **Calculation:** 9 + 2 = **11**.
- **Prime Check:** 11 is **prime**.
- **Outcome:**
  ```
  Player 1 adds 2. Total sum is now 11.
  11 is a prime number. Player 1 loses!
  ```

- **Winner:** **Player 2**

---

#### **Strategic Play Example**

**Starting the Game:**

- **Total Sum:** 0

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Action:** Chooses number **1**.
- **Calculation:** 0 + 1 = **1**.
- **Prime Check:** 1 is **not prime**.
- **Output:**
  ```
  Player 1 adds 1. Total sum is now 1.
  ```

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Action:** Chooses number **2**.
- **Calculation:** 1 + 2 = **3**.
- **Prime Check:** 3 is **prime**.
- **Outcome:**
  ```
  Player 2 adds 2. Total sum is now 3.
  3 is a prime number. Player 2 loses!
  ```

- **Winner:** **Player 1**

---

**Explanation:**

- **Player 1** smartly started with **1**, keeping the total sum low.
- **Player 2** chose **2**, perhaps not considering that **1 + 2 = 3**, which is prime.
- **Player 2** loses by making the total sum a prime number.

---

### **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

**Game Start:**

```
Welcome to Prime Total!
Starting Total Sum: 0

Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 10: 6
Player 1 adds 6. Total sum is now 6.
6 is not prime.

Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 10: 4
Player 2 adds 4. Total sum is now 10.
10 is not prime.

Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 10: 7
Player 1 adds 7. Total sum is now 17.
17 is a prime number. Player 1 loses!

Player 2 wins the game!
```
