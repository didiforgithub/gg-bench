In the gym environment for the Gridlock game, the action space consists of 16 discrete actions, each representing a possible move corresponding to a specific cell on the 4x4 grid. The indices 0 through 15 map to grid cells in row-major order:

- Index 0 represents cell (1,1).
- Index 1 represents cell (1,2).
- Index 2 represents cell (1,3).
- Index 3 represents cell (1,4).
- Index 4 represents cell (2,1).
- Index 5 represents cell (2,2).
- Index 6 represents cell (2,3).
- Index 7 represents cell (2,4).
- Index 8 represents cell (3,1).
- Index 9 represents cell (3,2).
- Index 10 represents cell (3,3).
- Index 11 represents cell (3,4).
- Index 12 represents cell (4,1).
- Index 13 represents cell (4,2).
- Index 14 represents cell (4,3).
- Index 15 represents cell (4,4).

Each action places a marker for the current player in the corresponding cell if it satisfies the game rules.
