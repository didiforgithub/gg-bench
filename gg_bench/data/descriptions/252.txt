**Game Title:** Bit Flip Duel

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to turn all bits in your binary sequence to **1**. Use strategic bit flipping to optimize your own sequence while influencing your opponent's sequence. The player who successfully changes all bits in their binary sequence to **1** wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

- Each player has a binary sequence containing **5 bits**, initially set to **0**. That is, both players start with **`00000`**.
- Players agree on who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Player Binary Sequences:** Each player maintains their own sequence of 5 bits.
  - **Appearance:** A sequence of 5 binary digits, e.g., `0 0 0 0 0`.
  - **Functionality:** Bits can be flipped from **0** to **1** or from **1** to **0**.
- **Bit Positions:** The bits are numbered from **1** to **5**, left to right.
  - **Position 1:** Leftmost bit.
  - **Position 5:** Rightmost bit.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately. The player determined during setup begins.
2. **Player Actions on Their Turn:**
   - **Select a Bit to Flip:** Choose a bit position between **1** and **5**.
   - **Flip the Bit in Your Own Sequence:** Change the selected bit from **0** to **1** or from **1** to **0**.
   - **Simultaneous Flip in Opponent's Sequence:** The same bit in your opponent's sequence will also flip.
3. **Turn Progression:** After completing your action, the turn passes to your opponent.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Flipping Bits:**
   - On your turn, you must flip **one** bit in your own sequence.
   - Flipping a bit changes its value:
     - **0** becomes **1**.
     - **1** becomes **0**.
   - The corresponding bit in your opponent's sequence **also flips** simultaneously.
2. **Legal Moves:**
   - You must flip a bit in your own sequence; passing is not allowed.
   - You can select any bit from positions **1** to **5**.
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player whose binary sequence consists entirely of **1s** (`1 1 1 1 1`) wins immediately.
4. **Game Continuation:**
   - If neither player has all bits set to **1** after a move, the game continues with the next player's turn.
5. **No Draws:**
   - Due to the nature of the game mechanics, a draw is impossible. The game will continue until one player achieves a sequence of all **1s**.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory:** Winning the game by turning all your bits to **1**.
- **No Point System:** The game does not utilize points; victory is determined purely by achieving the objective.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Initial State:**

- **Player 1 Sequence:** `0 0 0 0 0`
- **Player 2 Sequence:** `0 0 0 0 0`

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action:** Flip bit **3**.
- **Player 1 Sequence After Move:** `0 0 **1** 0 0`
- **Player 2 Sequence After Move:** `0 0 **1** 0 0`
- **Explanation:** Both players' bit 3 flips from **0** to **1**.

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action:** Flip bit **5**.
- **Player 2 Sequence After Move:** `0 0 1 0 **1**`
- **Player 1 Sequence After Move:** `0 0 1 0 **1**`
- **Explanation:** Both players' bit 5 flips from **0** to **1**.

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action:** Flip bit **2**.
- **Player 1 Sequence After Move:** `0 **1** 1 0 1`
- **Player 2 Sequence After Move:** `0 **1** 1 0 1`
- **Explanation:** Both players' bit 2 flips from **0** to **1**.

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action:** Flip bit **4**.
- **Player 2 Sequence After Move:** `0 1 1 **1** 1`
- **Player 1 Sequence After Move:** `0 1 1 **1** 1`
- **Explanation:** Both players' bit 4 flips from **0** to **1**.

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Action:** Flip bit **1**.
- **Player 1 Sequence After Move:** `**1** 1 1 1 1`
- **Player 2 Sequence After Move:** `**1** 1 1 1 1`
- **Explanation:** Both players' bit 1 flips from **0** to **1**.

---

**Outcome:**

- **Player 1's Sequence:** `1 1 1 1 1` (All bits are **1**)
- **Player 2's Sequence:** `1 1 1 1 1` (All bits are **1**)
- **Winner:** **Player 1**, as they achieved all **1s** at the end of their turn.

---

#### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Mirrored Impact:** Every move affects both your sequence and your opponent's sequence equally. Plan your moves to benefit you more than your opponent.
- **Timing:** Think ahead to anticipate how flipping a bit will bring you closer to victory while considering the potential benefits to your opponent.
- **Bit Selection:** Choosing which bit to flip is crucial. Consider the current state of both sequences before deciding.

### **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

**Notation:**
- **P1:** Player 1
- **P2:** Player 2
- **Sequences are displayed as:** `Bit1 Bit2 Bit3 Bit4 Bit5`

---

**Game Start**

```
P1 Sequence: 0 0 0 0 0
P2 Sequence: 0 0 0 0 0
```

---

**P1's Turn**

```
P1, enter bit position to flip (1-5): 3

P1 flips bit 3.

New Sequences:
P1 Sequence: 0 0 1 0 0
P2 Sequence: 0 0 1 0 0
```

---

**P2's Turn**

```
P2, enter bit position to flip (1-5): 5

P2 flips bit 5.

New Sequences:
P1 Sequence: 0 0 1 0 1
P2 Sequence: 0 0 1 0 1
```

---

**P1's Turn**

```
P1, enter bit position to flip (1-5): 2

P1 flips bit 2.

New Sequences:
P1 Sequence: 0 1 1 0 1
P2 Sequence: 0 1 1 0 1
```

---

**P2's Turn**

```
P2, enter bit position to flip (1-5): 4

P2 flips bit 4.

New Sequences:
P1 Sequence: 0 1 1 1 1
P2 Sequence: 0 1 1 1 1
```

---

**P1's Turn**

```
P1, enter bit position to flip (1-5): 1

P1 flips bit 1.

New Sequences:
P1 Sequence: 1 1 1 1 1
P2 Sequence: 1 1 1 1 1

Congratulations, P1 has turned all bits to 1 and wins the game!
```

---

### **Game End**

The game concludes when a player achieves a sequence where all bits are **1**. In the example above, **Player 1** wins on their third turn by flipping bit **1**, resulting in a sequence of `1 1 1 1 1`.

---

**Note:** This game is designed for quick play and strategic depth. Players must think ahead and consider the consequences of each bit flip, as it affects both players equally.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
