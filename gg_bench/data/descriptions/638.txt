# Number Reach: Rule Book

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
Be the first player to reach the **target number** exactly by strategically applying mathematical operations to the **current number**. Reaching the target number wins the game immediately. Overshooting the target number results in an instant loss.

## Setup

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - **Starting Number:** `1`
   - **Target Number:** `20`

2. **Player Assignment:**  
   - Two players are required: **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Determine who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Current Number:**  
  The number that players manipulate during their turns, starting at `1`.

- **Target Number:**  
  The number players aim to reach, set at `20`.

- **Operations:**
  - **Add 1 (+1):** Increment the current number by one.
  - **Multiply by 2 (×2):** Double the current number.

- **Game Interface:**  
  A command-line interface where players input their chosen operations. No physical pieces or board are required.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  - Players take turns in sequence, starting with **Player 1**.
  - On each turn, a player performs **one** operation on the current number.

- **Available Actions on a Turn:**
  - Choose **one** of the two operations:
    - Add 1 to the current number.
    - Multiply the current number by 2.

- **Progression:**
  - After a player performs an operation, the new number becomes the current number for the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Operation Rules:**
   - **Add 1 (+1):**  
     - Syntax: `+1`
     - Functionality: `current_number = current_number + 1`

   - **Multiply by 2 (×2):**  
     - Syntax: `*2`
     - Functionality: `current_number = current_number * 2`

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - If a player’s operation results in the current number being **exactly equal** to the target number (`20`), that player **wins** immediately.

3. **Losing the Game:**
   - If a player's operation causes the current number to exceed the target number (`current_number > 20`), that player **loses** immediately.

4. **Continuing Play:**
   - If the current number is less than the target number after a turn (`current_number < 20`), the game continues with the next player's turn.

5. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw. It continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules above.

## Scoring

- **Victory:**
  - The player who reaches the target number (`20`) exactly wins the game.

- **Defeat:**
  - The player who causes the current number to exceed the target number loses the game.

- **No Points System:**
  - There is no points system; the game outcome is win or lose based on reaching the target number.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Conditions:**
- Current Number: `1`
- Target Number: `20`

**Turn-by-Turn Breakdown:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `1`
   - Action: `*2` (Multiply by 2)
   - Calculation: `1 * 2 = 2`
   - New Current Number: `2`

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `2`
   - Action: `*2` (Multiply by 2)
   - Calculation: `2 * 2 = 4`
   - New Current Number: `4`

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `4`
   - Action: `*2` (Multiply by 2)
   - Calculation: `4 * 2 = 8`
   - New Current Number: `8`

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `8`
   - Action: `+1` (Add 1)
   - Calculation: `8 + 1 = 9`
   - New Current Number: `9`

5. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `9`
   - Action: `*2` (Multiply by 2)
   - Calculation: `9 * 2 = 18`
   - New Current Number: `18`

6. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `18`
   - Action: `+1` (Add 1)
   - Calculation: `18 + 1 = 19`
   - New Current Number: `19`

7. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Current Number: `19`
   - Action: `+1` (Add 1)
   - Calculation: `19 + 1 = 20`
   - New Current Number: `20`
   - **Player 1 Wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start:**
```
Target Number: 20
Current Number: 1

Player 1's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): *2
New Current Number: 2

Player 2's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): *2
New Current Number: 4

Player 1's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): *2
New Current Number: 8

Player 2's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): +1
New Current Number: 9

Player 1's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): *2
New Current Number: 18

Player 2's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): +1
New Current Number: 19

Player 1's turn.
Enter your move (+1 or *2): +1
New Current Number: 20

Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:**  
  Anticipate the results of your moves to avoid overshooting the target number.

- **Control the Pace:**  
  Use addition or multiplication strategically to force your opponent into a losing position.

- **Avoid Overshooting:**  
  Be cautious when the current number is close to the target. Opt for addition if multiplication would cause you to exceed `20`.

## Game Variations

- **Different Target Number:**  
  Alter the target number to increase or decrease game length and complexity.

- **Additional Operations:**  
  Introduce new operations like subtracting 1 (`-1`) or dividing by 2 (`/2`) with appropriate rules adjustments.

- **Three-Player Version:**  
  Adapt the turn order to accommodate more players, with the same objective and rules.
