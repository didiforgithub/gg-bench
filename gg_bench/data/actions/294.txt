In the gym environment, the action space is defined as `Discrete(self.max_N + 1)`, where actions correspond to integers from 0 to `max_N`. Each action index represents a potential divisor a player can select on their turn. For a move to be valid, the selected action (a number) must be a proper divisor of the current `N` in the game. Therefore, if a player chooses an action that is a proper divisor of `N` (greater than 1, less than `N`, and divides `N` without a remainder), it results in a valid move; otherwise, it is an invalid move, and the player loses. The mapping ensures that players select appropriate divisors as their actions, directly correlating action space indices to game moves based on divisor properties.
