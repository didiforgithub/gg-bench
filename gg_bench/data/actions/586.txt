In the game, actions are represented by indices in the action space, where each index corresponds to selecting a number from 1 to 10. The mapping is achieved by using the index directly: index 0 corresponds to selecting number 1, index 1 to selecting number 2, and so on up to index 9, which corresponds to selecting number 10. This is implemented in the code by mapping the action index `action` to the selected number `selected_number` using the formula `selected_number = action + 1`.
