# Bit Flip Challenge: Rule Book

## Objective

The goal of **Bit Flip Challenge** is to be the player who flips the last bit in a binary sequence from `0` to `1`. Players take turns flipping bits, and the player who makes the final move wins the game.

## Setup

- The game starts with a binary sequence of **10 bits**, all set to `0`:
  ```
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  ```
- There are two players: **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Binary Sequence**: A list of 10 bits (`0`s and `1`s) representing the game's state.
- **Bits**: Individual positions in the sequence that players can flip from `0` to `1`.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played by entering commands in a command-line environment.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with the designated first player.
- **On their turn**, a player must flip **at least one** bit from `0` to `1`.
- The bits flipped must adhere to the rules outlined in the **Rules and Mechanics** section.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Flipping Bits**:
   - On your turn, you can flip **one or more consecutive bits** from `0` to `1`.
   - The bits you flip must be **adjacent** and in a single sequence (no skipping bits).
   - You can only flip bits that are currently set to `0`.
   - You may choose any group of consecutive `0`s anywhere in the sequence.

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if it flips at least one `0` bit to `1` and follows the flipping rules.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (no `0`s remain), the game ends.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who flips the **last `0` bit** to `1` wins the game.

## Scoring

- **No point tracking** is needed.
- The game is won by fulfilling the objective, not by accumulating points.

Player 1, it's your turn.
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Enter the starting bit position to flip: 1
Enter the ending bit position to flip: 2
Flipping bits 1 to 2...
Current Bit Sequence: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Enter the starting bit position to flip: 5
Enter the ending bit position to flip: 5
Flipping bit 5...
Current Bit Sequence: 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Enter the starting bit position to flip: 3
Enter the ending bit position to flip: 4
Flipping bits 3 to 4...
Current Bit Sequence: 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Enter the starting bit position to flip: 6
Enter the ending bit position to flip: 8
Flipping bits 6 to 8...
Current Bit Sequence: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Enter the starting bit position to flip: 9
Enter the ending bit position to flip: 10
Flipping bits 9 to 10...
Current Bit Sequence: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
All bits have been flipped.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the number of remaining `0`s and plan your flips to force the opponent into a position where they have no good moves.
- **Control the Center**: Flipping bits in the center can limit your opponent's options.
- **Leave Gaps**: Sometimes leaving a single `0` between your flipped bits can create challenges for your opponent.

## Summary

Bit Flip Challenge is a simple yet strategic game that's easy to code and play in a command-line environment. The clear objectives and straightforward rules make it accessible, while the need for strategic planning offers depth for skilled players to consistently outperform less experienced opponents.

Enjoy the game and may the best player flip the last bit!
