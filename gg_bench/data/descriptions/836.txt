# Forbidden Adjacent

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a valid move by strategically claiming numbers and blocking your opponent. The goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot claim any more numbers.

## Setup

- **Number Line**: A sequential list of numbers from **1** to **9**.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Initial State**: All numbers are unclaimed and not forbidden at the start of the game.
- **First Turn**: Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Number Line**: Represents the playable numbers, displayed as:

  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  ```

- **Claimed Numbers**: Numbers that have been selected by players during the game.
  - Each player's claimed numbers are tracked separately.
- **Forbidden Numbers**: Numbers that cannot be claimed by either player due to adjacency rules.
  - These are numbers immediately adjacent (±1) to any claimed number.
- **Markers**:
  - **Unclaimed Numbers**: Displayed as normal digits (e.g., `3`).
  - **Claimed Numbers**: Marked with the player's identifier (e.g., `P1` or `P2`).
  - **Forbidden Numbers**: Enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `[4]`).

## Turns

Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.

### On Your Turn:

1. **Select a Number**:
   - Choose an unclaimed, non-forbidden number from the number line.
2. **Claim the Number**:
   - Mark the chosen number as claimed with your player identifier.
3. **Update Forbidden Numbers**:
   - Identify the adjacent numbers (±1) to the number you claimed.
   - Mark these adjacent numbers as forbidden by enclosing them in square brackets.

   **Note**:
   - If an adjacent number is already claimed or forbidden, no additional action is needed.
   - The number line does not wrap around; numbers beyond `1` and `9` are ignored.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Claiming Numbers**:
   - A number can only be claimed once.
   - You cannot claim a number that is forbidden.
2. **Forbidden Numbers**:
   - When you claim a number, both adjacent numbers become forbidden.
   - Forbidden numbers cannot be claimed by either player for the remainder of the game.
3. **Adjacency**:
   - For number `1`, only number `2` is adjacent.
   - For number `9`, only number `8` is adjacent.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - If you cannot claim any unclaimed, non-forbidden numbers on your turn, you lose.
   - The opposing player is declared the winner.
5. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw; a winner emerges once a player cannot make a valid move.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who successfully forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
- **Multiple Rounds** (Optional):
  - Keep track of games won if playing multiple rounds.
  - Determine an overall winner after a set number of games.

## Strategic Tips

- **Central Control**: Claim central numbers like `5` early to maximize forbidden numbers.
- **Anticipate Moves**: Pay attention to which numbers are still available and plan to block your opponent.
- **Force the Endgame**: Try to leave your opponent with no options by carefully choosing numbers that limit their future moves.
- **Avoid Early Corners**: Claiming edge numbers (`1` or `9`) early might limit your own options.

## Variations

- **Extended Number Line**: Increase the number line beyond `1` to `9` (e.g., `1` to `15`) for a longer game.
- **Alternate Forbidden Range**:
  - **Adjacency ±2**: Numbers within two steps become forbidden.
  - **Custom Forbidden Rules**: Define your own rules for which numbers become forbidden after a claim.
- **Multiple Claims per Turn**:
  - Allow players to claim more than one number per turn with adjusted rules for forbidden numbers.

## Conclusion

Forbidden Adjacent is a simple yet strategic game that tests foresight and planning. It's easy to learn and quick to play, making it perfect for casual gaming sessions or as a programming project for a command-line interface. Employ tactics to outmaneuver your opponent and claim victory!
