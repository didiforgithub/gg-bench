The action space in the environment maps each action index to a specific move in the game by combining a number selection and a grid position:

- The action space consists of 81 discrete actions, representing the 9 numbers (1-9) that can be placed in 9 positions on the 3x3 grid.
- An action index `a` is divided into a number index (`a // 9`) and a cell index (`a % 9`).
  - `number_index = a // 9`: This determines which number to place. The number itself is `number_index + 1`.
  - `cell_index = a % 9`: This specifies the position on the player's grid, ranging from position 0 to 8 (top-left to bottom-right).
