In the given gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.starting_number + 1)`, meaning it allows for selecting an integer from 0 to the `starting_number`, inclusive. However, the valid moves in the game correspond only to the indices that represent factors greater than 1 of the current shared number. The `valid_moves()` method generates this list of factors during each turn. While the action space is technically larger, only these valid factors (indices) can be chosen to divide the shared number, ensuring moves align with game rules.
