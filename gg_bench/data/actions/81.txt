In the game environment, the action space consists of integers from 0 to 8, where each index directly maps to selecting the corresponding number from 1 to 9 (i.e., action 0 corresponds to choosing the number 1, action 1 corresponds to choosing the number 2, and so on, up to action 8 which corresponds to choosing the number 9). This simplification allows for a straightforward mapping between actions and available game moves.
