In the given gym environment for **Operation Reach 100**, the action space consists of two discrete actions represented by indices:

- **Action 0**: Corresponds to the move "Add 1" (+1), which increments the current number by one.
- **Action 1**: Corresponds to the move "Multiply by 2" (Ã—2), which multiplies the current number by two.

These indices directly map to the two allowed mathematical operations in the game, enabling players to update the current number accordingly.
