# Number Conquest: Rule Book

## Objective

Become the first player to reduce your opponent's Life Points to zero by strategically selecting numbers to perform attacks or bolster your defense. Utilize the shared pool of numbers wisely to outmaneuver your opponent and achieve victory.

---

## Setup

1. **Life Points Initialization**:
   - Each player starts with **20 Life Points**.
   - Life Points represent the player's health. When a player's Life Points reach zero, they lose the game.

2. **Shield Points Initialization**:
   - Both players begin with **0 Shield Points**.
   - Shield Points absorb incoming damage but do not exceed a maximum limit (unlimited in this game).

3. **Number Pool**:
   - A shared pool of numbers from **1 to 9** is available.
   - These numbers are used for performing actions and are **removed from the pool once used**.

---

## Game Components

- **Life Points (LP)**:
  - Numeric value representing a player's health.
  - Starts at 20 for each player.

- **Shield Points (SP)**:

  - Starts at 0 and increases when a player chooses to defend.

- **Number Pool**:
  - Shared list of available numbers **[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]**.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:

   - Turns alternate between players.

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Step 1**: Display current Life Points, Shield Points, and available numbers.
   - **Step 2**: Choose an available number from the Number Pool.
   - **Step 3**: Choose an action:
     - **Attack**: Use the number to deal damage.
     - **Defend**: Use the number to increase your Shield Points.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Actions

#### Attack

- **Damage Calculation**:
  - **Damage Dealt** = Chosen Number - Opponent's Shield Points.
  - If the opponent has Shield Points, they are subtracted from the attack value.
  - **Example**: If you attack with a 6 and your opponent has 2 Shield Points:
    - Damage Dealt = 6 - 2 = 4.
    - Opponent's Shield Points reduce to 0.
  - **Shield Points cannot become negative**.
- **Life Points Reduction**:
  - Opponent's Life Points decrease by the Damage Dealt.
  - **Minimum Damage**: If Shield Points are equal to or exceed the attack value, Damage Dealt is 0.

#### Defend

- **Shield Increase**:
  - Your Shield Points increase by the value of the chosen number.
  - **Example**: If you defend with a 5:
    - Your Shield Points increase by 5.
- **Accumulation**:
  - Shield Points accumulate over turns unless reduced by attacks.

### Number Pool Management

- **Number Usage**:
  - Once a number is used for an action, it is **removed** from the Number Pool.
  - Both players cannot use that number again.
- **Availability**:
  - Players can only choose from the remaining numbers in the pool on their turn.

### Victory Condition

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins when their opponent's Life Points are reduced to **zero or below**.
- **No Draws**:
  - Since numbers are finite and Life Points will eventually reach zero, the game cannot end in a draw.

---

## Scoring

- **Life Points Tracking**:
  - Main metric for determining the winner.
  - Keep track of both players' Life Points throughout the game.

- **Shield Points Tracking**:
  - Important for defense strategy and calculating damage.
  - Reset only when reduced by attacks; otherwise, they accumulate.
