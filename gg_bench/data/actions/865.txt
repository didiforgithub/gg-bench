In the `CustomEnv` class, the action space is defined with `spaces.Discrete(8)`, which provides 8 discrete actions, corresponding to action indices 0 through 7. These indices map directly to the multipliers used in the game, with the action index added to 2 to obtain the actual game multiplier. Thus, action index 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2, index 1 to a multiplier of 3, up to index 7 corresponding to a multiplier of 9.
