The action space indices map to moves in the game as follows:

- Index `0`: Activates Ether's Revive ability to bring back an eliminated element.
- Indices `1-50`: Represent attack moves, divided into specific combinations:
  - `1-10`: Player chooses Fire as the attacking element, targeting all opponent elements (each opponent element can either trigger an attack with or without using Fire's special ability).
  - `11-20`: Player chooses Water as the attacking element, targeting all opponent elements (only basic attacks, since Water has no special ability for attack).
  - `21-30`: Player chooses Earth as the attacking element, targeting all opponent elements (only basic attacks, since Earth has no special ability for attack).
  - `31-40`: Player chooses Air as the attacking element, targeting all opponent elements (each opponent element can either trigger an attack with or without using Air's special ability).
  - `41-50`: Player chooses Ether as the attacking element, targeting all opponent elements (only basic attacks, since Ether cannot use any special ability when attacking).

Each sequence of 10 indices represents a specific attacking element, with even indices indicating a basic attack and odd indices indicating the use of the attacking element's special ability if applicable.
