In the provided gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(101)`, where actions represent integers from 0 to 100. However, since all valid moves in the game are proper divisors of the Current Number, only a subset of these actions is valid at each step. Specifically, a player should select an action (integer) that is a proper divisor of the Current Number, i.e., a positive integer less than the Current Number that divides it without a remainder. The game's logic filters actions to valid moves using the method `valid_moves()`, which ensures players only choose proper divisors during their turn. The mapping of action space indices is straightforward: each index corresponds to an integer value, and only those indices representing current proper divisors are valid moves.
