The action space indices (0 to 17) directly correspond to selecting numbers from the list of available numbers in the shared number pool (`-9 to -1` and `1 to 9`). Index `0` refers to `-9`, index `1` to `-8`, up to index `8` for `-1`, and index `9` for `1`, continuing onward in sequence up to index `17` for `9`. Each index action selects and removes the number at that index in the `numbers_list` array from the shared number pool to update the cumulative sum.
