# Divisor Duel Rule Book

## Objective

Divisor Duel is a competitive two-player, turn-based game where players take turns adding digits to form a number. The primary goal is to be the first player to create a number that is divisible by a predetermined target divisor. Strategic selection of digits and foresight are key, as each move can bring you closer to victory or set up your opponent for a win.

## Setup

1. **Determine the Target Divisor**: Before the game begins, players agree upon a target divisor (e.g., 3, 7, 11). This number should be a positive integer greater than 1.
2. **Initialize the Digit Pool**: Create a shared pool containing the digits **1** through **9**. Each digit is available for selection once.
3. **Initialize the Number**: Start with an empty number. As the game progresses, digits will be appended to this number to form a multi-digit integer.

## Game Components

- **Digit Pool**: A list of available digits from **1** to **9**. Digits are removed from the pool once selected.
- **Current Number**: The number being formed by appending selected digits. It starts empty and grows with each turn.
- **Target Divisor**: The agreed-upon number that players aim to divide the current number by without a remainder.

## Turns

1. **Starting the Game**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., flip a coin).
2. **Player Actions**: On your turn, perform the following steps:
   - **Select a Digit**: Choose any available digit from the digit pool.
   - **Append the Digit**: Add the chosen digit to the *right end* of the current number.
   - **Update the Digit Pool**: Remove the selected digit from the digit pool.
   - **Check for Victory**: Determine if the new current number is divisible by the target divisor.

3. **End of Turn**: If no win condition is met, the turn passes to the other player.
4. **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - Players can only choose from the digits currently available in the digit pool.
   - Each digit (1-9) can be used only once in the game.

2. **Number Formation**:
   - The current number is formed by appending digits to the right end.
   - No rearrangement of digits is allowed once they are placed.

3. **Victory Conditions**:
   - **Immediate Win**: If after your turn, the current number is divisible evenly by the target divisor (i.e., the remainder is zero), you win the game.
   - **Forced Loss**: If all digits have been used without creating a number divisible by the target divisor, the last player to have moved loses the game.

4. **Example of Divisibility**:
   - A number is divisible by the target divisor if there is no remainder when dividing.
   - For example, if the target divisor is **7**, and the current number is **14**, since 14 ÷ 7 = 2 with no remainder, the number is divisible by 7.

5. **Prohibited Actions**:
   - You cannot skip your turn.
   - You cannot select a digit not present in the digit pool.
   - You cannot remove or change the order of previously placed digits.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: Successfully creating a number divisible by the target divisor results in an immediate win.
- **Losing the Game**: If all digits are used and the current number is not divisible by the target divisor, the player who made the last move loses.
- **No Draws**: The game is designed to always produce a winner; draws are not possible.

## Examples

### Example 1: Target Divisor is 7

**Setup**:
- **Digit Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Current Number**: (empty)

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 1
   - **Current Number**: 1
   - **Digit Pool**: 2-9
   - **Check**: 1 ÷ 7 → Remainder ≠ 0 (no win)
  
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 4
   - **Current Number**: 1**4**
   - **Digit Pool**: 2,3,5-9
   - **Check**: 14 ÷ 7 = 2 (no remainder)
   - **Result**: Player 2 wins.

### Example 2: Target Divisor is 5

**Setup**:
- **Digit Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Current Number**: (empty)

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 2
   - **Current Number**: 2
   - **Digit Pool**: 1,3-9
   - **Check**: 2 ÷ 5 → Remainder ≠ 0 (no win)

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 3
   - **Current Number**: 2**3**
   - **Digit Pool**: 1,4-9
   - **Check**: 23 ÷ 5 → Remainder ≠ 0 (no win)

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 1
   - **Current Number**: 2**3**1
   - **Digit Pool**: 4-9
   - **Check**: 231 ÷ 5 → Remainder = 1 (no win)

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 9
   - **Current Number**: 231**9**
   - **Digit Pool**: 4-8
   - **Check**: 2319 ÷ 5 = 463.8 (remainder 4) (no win)

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Selects Digit**: 5
   - **Current Number**: 2319**5**
   - **Digit Pool**: 4,6-8
   - **Check**: 23195 ÷ 5 = 4639 (no remainder)
   - **Result**: Player 1 wins.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Target Divisor: 7
Available Digits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Current Number: 

Player 1's turn.
Select a digit: 5
Current Number: 5
Available Digits: 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
5 is not divisible by 7.

Player 2's turn.
Select a digit: 2
Current Number: 5**2**
Available Digits: 1 3 4 6 7 8 9
52 is not divisible by 7.

Player 1's turn.
Select a digit: 1
Current Number: 52**1**
Available Digits: 3 4 6 7 8 9
521 is not divisible by 7.

Player 2's turn.
Select a digit: 4
Current Number: 521**4**
Available Digits: 3 6 7 8 9
5214 ÷ 7 = 744.857 (remainder ≠ 0)

Player 1's turn.
Select a digit: 7
Current Number: 5214**7**
Available Digits: 3 6 8 9
52147 ÷ 7 = 7449.571 (remainder ≠ 0)

Player 2's turn.
Select a digit: 3
Current Number: 52147**3**
Available Digits: 6 8 9
521473 ÷ 7 = 74496.142 (remainder ≠ 0)

... [Game continues]

Assuming all digits are used without forming a number divisible by 7:

Final Digit Pool: Empty
Current Number: 521473689
No player has created a number divisible by 7.
**Result**: The last player to move (Player 2) loses. Player 1 wins.
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate which digits could lead to a win in subsequent turns and try to block your opponent.
- **Avoid Immediate Loss**: Be cautious not to set up the current number in a way that allows your opponent to win on their next turn.
- **Digit Importance**: Some digits may be more advantageous based on the target divisor. Identify and prioritize these digits.
- **Mathematical Calculation**: Quickly calculating the divisibility of potential numbers can give you a strategic edge.

## Conclusion
