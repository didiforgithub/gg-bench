# Grid Runner: Rule Book

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
Be the first player to navigate from the starting position at the top-left corner of a 5x5 grid to the ending position at the bottom-right corner.

**Victory Condition:**  
A player wins by successfully moving their token to the ending position (5,5) without triggering opponent's traps.

## Setup

1. **Grid Initialization:**  
   - Create a 5x5 grid with coordinates ranging from (1,1) to (5,5).
   - The grid cells are identified by their row and column numbers.

2. **Starting Positions:**  
   - Both Player 1 and Player 2 start at position (1,1).

3. **Trap Placement:**  
   - Each player secretly selects three distinct grid positions to place traps.
   - Traps cannot be placed on the starting position (1,1) or the ending position (5,5).
   - Trap positions are kept hidden from the opponent.

## Game Components

- **Grid:**  
  A 5x5 matrix representing the game board with coordinate positions.

- **Player Tokens:**  
  - Each player has a token representing their current position on the grid.
  - Tokens are tracked by their coordinates.

- **Traps:**  
  - Invisible to the opponent, traps are special markers placed on the grid.
  - Triggering a trap sends the opponent back to the starting position.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:**  
   - Players take alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn:**  
   - **Move:**  
     - Move your token to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).
     - Diagonal moves are not allowed.
   - **Check for Traps:**  
     - After moving, check if the new position is trapped by the opponent.

3. **Turn Progression:**  
   - After completing the move and resolving any trap effects, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules:**  
   - Players can move only to adjacent cells (no diagonal moves).
   - Players cannot move outside the boundaries of the grid.

2. **Trap Mechanics:**  
   - If a player moves onto a cell containing an opponent's trap:
     - The player is sent back to the starting position (1,1).
     - The trap remains active for the rest of the game.
   - Players cannot trigger their own traps.

3. **Winning the Game:**  
   - The first player to reach the ending position (5,5) wins the game.
   - If a player triggers a trap upon reaching (5,5), they are sent back to the start.

4. **Additional Rules:**  
   - Players must keep track of their own traps and deduce the possible locations of opponent's traps based on gameplay.
   - Communication between players is limited to declaring moves and cannot include hints or trap locations.

## Scoring

- **Victory:**  
  - The winning player is the first to reach the ending position (5,5).
- **No Points System:**  
  - The game does not use a points system; the focus is on reaching the goal.

**Gameplay Notes:**

- The interface informs players of their current position and the result of their move.
- Trap triggers are announced, but trap locations remain active for the rest of the game.
- Players must strategize based on the information provided after each move.

## Strategy Tips

- **Avoid Known Traps:**  
  Keep track of trap locations you've discovered to avoid them in future turns.

- **Predict Opponent's Traps:**  
  Consider common paths and likely trap placements by your opponent.

- **Diversify Your Path:**  
  Use different routes to approach the ending position to minimize the risk of hitting a trap.

- **Set Strategic Traps:**  
  Place traps on likely paths your opponent might take to increase the chances they'll trigger them.

- **Mind Game:**  
  Sometimes retracing steps or feigning interest in a particular path can mislead your opponent.
