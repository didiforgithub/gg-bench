In this game environment, the action space indices (0 to 4) correspond directly to the player's move options (adding numbers 1 to 5, inclusive) to the cumulative total. Specifically, index 0 maps to adding 1, index 1 to adding 2, index 2 to adding 3, index 3 to adding 4, and index 4 to adding 5. This allows the player to choose their move by selecting an integer from the action space, thereby adding the respective number to the cumulative total.
