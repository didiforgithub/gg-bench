In the provided gym environment for the Binary Battle game, each action space index (from 0 to 4) directly maps to a corresponding bit position (from 1 to 5) in the player's binary number. Specifically, action 0 corresponds to toggling Bit 1 (the highest value bit), action 1 corresponds to Bit 2, continuing to action 4, which corresponds to Bit 5 (the lowest value bit).
