In the game, numbers 1 through 10 are represented in the action space as indices 0 through 9, respectively. When a player selects an action, the index is incremented by 1 to map it to the corresponding game move. For example, choosing action 0 in the action space corresponds to selecting the number 1 in the game; similarly, action 9 corresponds to choosing the number 10.
