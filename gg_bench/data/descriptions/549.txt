# Prime Time: A Two-Player Strategic Number Game

---

## Objective

**Prime Time** is a strategic two-player game where the goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Players take turns selecting numbers from a shared pool based on specific divisibility rules. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses the game. There are no draws in **Prime Time**, ensuring that each game concludes with a definitive winner.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization**:
   - Create a shared pool of integers ranging from **2 to 50** inclusive.
   - All numbers are initially available for selection.

2. **Starting the Game**:
   - Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be done by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

1. **Number Pool**:
   - A list of numbers from **2 to 50**.
   - Numbers are removed from the pool once selected.

2. **Player Roles**:
   - **Player 1**: Takes the first turn.
   - **Player 2**: Takes the second turn.

3. **Selected Numbers Log**:
   - A record of numbers chosen during the game, in the order they were selected.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

2. **Actions Per Turn**:
   - **Player 1 (First Turn Only)**:
     - Select any number from the number pool.
   - **Subsequent Turns**:
     - Select a number from the pool that **shares a common factor greater than 1** with the last number chosen by the opponent.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a player selects a number, it becomes the "current number."
   - The selected number is removed from the number pool.
   - The turn passes to the opponent.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection Rules**:
   - **First Move**:
     - Player 1 can choose any number from 2 to 50.
   - **Subsequent Moves**:
     - A player must select a number that shares a common factor (other than 1) with the "current number" (the last number chosen by the opponent).
     - If multiple valid numbers are available, the player may choose any of them.

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if:
     - The selected number is in the number pool.
     - It shares a common factor greater than 1 with the "current number."

3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (no numbers in the pool share a common factor greater than 1 with the "current number"), they lose the game.

4. **Factors and Common Factors**:
   - Factors of a number include all integers greater than 1 that divide the number without leaving a remainder.
   - Common factors are factors that two numbers share.
   - Only common factors greater than 1 are considered (excluding 1).

5. **Example of Common Factors**:
   - Numbers **14** and **21** share a common factor of **7**.
   - Numbers **15** and **16** do not share any common factors greater than 1.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, the opposing player wins.
- **No Point System**:
  - **Prime Time** does not use a point system. Victory is achieved by strategic number selection leading to the opponent's inability to move.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sample Game Play

#### Initial Setup:

- Number Pool: 2 to 50.
- Player 1 starts.

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **14** (factors: 2, 7).
   - "Current number" is now **14**.
   - Number Pool is updated (14 is removed).

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Must choose a number sharing a common factor with **14**.
   - Options include numbers that share factors **2** or **7** (e.g., 7, 21, 28, 35, 42, etc.).
   - Chooses **21** (factors: 3, 7).
   - "Current number" is now **21**.
   - Number Pool is updated (21 is removed).

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Must choose a number sharing a common factor with **21**.
   - Common factors are **3** and **7**.
   - Options include numbers like 3, 9, 27 (factor 3) or 7, 14 (already used), 28, 35, 42, etc. (factor 7).
   - Chooses **28** (factors: 2, 2, 7).
   - "Current number" is now **28**.
   - Number Pool is updated (28 is removed).

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Must choose a number sharing a common factor with **28**.
   - Common factors are **2** and **7**.
   - Options are numbers with factors **2** or **7** (excluding numbers already used).
   - Chooses **35** (factors: 5, 7).
   - "Current number" is now **35**.
   - Number Pool is updated (35 is removed).

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Must choose a number sharing a common factor with **35**.
   - Common factors are **5** and **7**.
   - Options include numbers with factors **5** or **7**.
   - Chooses **10** (factors: 2, 5).
   - "Current number" is now **10**.
   - Number Pool is updated (10 is removed).

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Must choose a number sharing a common factor with **10**.
   - Common factors are **2** and **5**.
   - Options include numbers with factors **2** or **5**.
   - Chooses **25** (factors: 5, 5).
   - "Current number" is now **25**.

   - Common factor is **5**.
   - Options include numbers like **5**, **15**, **20**, **30**, **35** (already used), etc.
   - Chooses **15** (factors: 3, 5).
   - "Current number" is now **15**.

   - Common factors are **2** and **3**.
   - Options include numbers with factors **2** or **3**, excluding those already used.
   - Chooses **17** (prime number, factors: 17).
   - **Invalid Move** as 17 shares no common factors with 18.

### Example 2: Command-Line Interaction

Below is a sample interaction in a command-line interface simulating a game of **Prime Time**.

#### Game Start

```
Welcome to Prime Time!

Number Pool: 2-50
Player 1, it's your turn. Choose a number from the pool.

Player 1 selects: 12

Number Pool updated. 12 is removed.

Player 2, it's your turn. The last number was 12.
Numbers sharing a common factor with 12 are: [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50]

Player 2 selects: 15

Number Pool updated. 15 is removed.

Player 1, it's your turn. The last number was 15.
Numbers sharing a common factor with 15 are: [3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 42, 45, 48, 49, 50]

Player 1 selects: 21

... (Gameplay continues)

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of remaining numbers in the pool and anticipate which numbers your opponent may be forced to choose.
- **Control the Factors**: By selecting numbers with unique factors, you limit your opponent's options.
- **Avoid Primes Late Game**: Selecting prime numbers early can limit your own future moves since primes have fewer common factors.
- **Force Invalid Moves**: Try to steer the game towards numbers where your opponent has minimal valid options.

---

## Summary

**Prime Time** is a simple yet strategically deep game that challenges players to think ahead and understand number factors. With easy-to-understand rules and quick gameplay, it is perfect for a command-line interface implementation and ensures that skilled players can consistently outperform less experienced ones.

Have fun playing **Prime Time** and may the best strategist win!
