# Factor Frenzy Rule Book

Welcome to **Factor Frenzy**, a strategic two-player turn-based game designed for quick play in a command-line interface. Engage in a battle of wits as you manipulate numbers and outmaneuver your opponent to achieve victory.

---

## Objective

The primary goal of **Factor Frenzy** is to be the player who reduces the shared number to **1** on your turn. Players achieve victory by strategically choosing proper factors of the current number to subtract, forcing the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

A player **wins** the game by:

- Reducing the shared number to **1** on their turn.

A player **loses** the game if:

- They cannot select a valid proper factor on their turn because the current number is prime and greater than **1**.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Decide on a starting positive integer **N** between **10** and **50** (inclusive). This number will be the shared number both players will manipulate during the game.

2. **Player Order**: Determine who will take the first turn. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Initial Conditions**: The game begins with the shared number set to the chosen starting number **N**.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: The central element of the game; a positive integer that changes as players subtract factors.
  
- **Players**: Two players alternate turns. No physical pieces, boards, or cards are requiredâ€”just the ability to perform calculations and input commands.

- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via text input and output in a command-line environment.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Display Current Number**: At the beginning of each turn, the current shared number is displayed.

2. **Player Action**: The active player selects a proper factor of the current number to subtract.

3. **Update Number**: The chosen factor is subtracted from the current number to form the new shared number.

4. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**: Determine if the game has been won or if the next player cannot make a valid move.

5. **Pass Turn**: If the game has not ended, the turn passes to the other player.

### Player Actions

- On their turn, a player must:
  - **Choose a Proper Factor**: Select a proper factor of the current number (an integer greater than **1** and less than the current number that divides it evenly).
  - **Subtract the Factor**: Subtract the selected factor from the current number.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Proper Factors Only**: Players can only select proper factors of the current number. Factors must satisfy:
   - Greater than **1**.
   - Less than the current number.
   - Divides the current number evenly (no remainder).

2. **Updating the Number**:
   - Subtract the chosen factor from the current number.
   - The result becomes the new current number for the next turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces the current number to **1** on their turn, they win the game.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If the current number is prime (and greater than **1**), and the player cannot select a valid proper factor, they lose the game.

5. **No Reuse Restrictions**:
   - Factors can be reused in subsequent turns if they are still proper factors of the new current number.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Winning the game by reducing the number to **1** on your turn.

- **No Point System**: The game does not use a point or scoring system. Victory is achieved directly through gameplay.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Setup

- Starting Number (**N**): **24**
- Player 1: Alice
- Player 2: Bob
- Alice will take the first turn.

#### Turn-By-Turn Breakdown

---

**Turn 1: Alice**

- **Current Number**: 24
- **Proper Factors of 24**: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
- **Alice's Move**: Chooses factor **12**
- **Calculation**: 24 - 12 = **12**
- **Updated Number**: 12
- **Status**: Game continues.

---

**Turn 2: Bob**

- **Current Number**: 12
- **Proper Factors of 12**: 2, 3, 4, 6
- **Bob's Move**: Chooses factor **6**
- **Calculation**: 12 - 6 = **6**
- **Updated Number**: 6
- **Status**: Game continues.

---

**Turn 3: Alice**

- **Current Number**: 6
- **Proper Factors of 6**: 2, 3
- **Alice's Move**: Chooses factor **3**
- **Calculation**: 6 - 3 = **3**
- **Updated Number**: 3
- **Status**: Game continues.

---

**Turn 4: Bob**

- **Current Number**: 3
- **Proper Factors of 3**: None (since 3 is prime and greater than 1)
- **Bob's Move**: Cannot make a move.

- **Bob Loses**: Bob cannot select a proper factor.
- **Alice Wins**: By default since Bob cannot make a move.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start**

```
Starting Factor Frenzy!
Choose a starting number between 10 and 50: 24
Player 1 (Alice) will start.
```

---

**Turn 1: Alice**

```
Current Number: 24
Proper factors available: [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12]
Alice, choose a proper factor to subtract: 12
You selected 12.
New Current Number: 12
```

---

**Turn 2: Bob**

```
Current Number: 12
Proper factors available: [2, 3, 4, 6]
Bob, choose a proper factor to subtract: 6
You selected 6.
New Current Number: 6
```

---

**Turn 3: Alice**

```
Current Number: 6
Proper factors available: [2, 3]
Alice, choose a proper factor to subtract: 3
You selected 3.
New Current Number: 3
```

---

**Turn 4: Bob**

```
Current Number: 3
No proper factors available. 3 is prime.
Bob cannot make a move.
Bob loses! Alice wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Aim for Primes**: Try to force the current number to be a prime number greater than 1 on your opponent's turn.

- **Control the Flow**: By choosing factors that leave fewer options for your opponent, you can dictate the pace of the game.

- **Think Ahead**: Consider the possible results of each of your potential moves and how they will impact your opponent's options.
