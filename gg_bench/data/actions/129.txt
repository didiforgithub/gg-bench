In the GridLock Duel game implemented in the gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(16)`, meaning the player can choose any integer from 0 to 15 as their action. This integer corresponds directly to a cell on the 4x4 grid:

- Index 0 corresponds to cell 1
- Index 1 corresponds to cell 2
- Index 2 corresponds to cell 3
- ...
- Index 15 corresponds to cell 16

Each index represents a position on the grid where a player can place their marker. The mapping is sequential from the top-left of the grid (cell 1) to the bottom-right (cell 16).
