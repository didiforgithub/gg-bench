# Gridlock

## Objective

Gridlock is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a 4x4 grid. The primary goal is to be the first player to create a connected sequence of at least **three of your own tokens** in a straight line—horizontal, vertical, or diagonal—where the numbers on your tokens form a strict ascending or descending order.

## Setup

- **Grid Initialization**: Begin with an empty 4x4 grid. Each cell is identified by its row (A-D) and column (1-4), such as A1 or C3.
- **Player Tokens**:
  - **Player 1** receives tokens numbered **1 to 8**.
  - **Player 2** receives tokens numbered **1 to 8**.
- **Starting Conditions**:
  - Both players have all their tokens unplaced.
  - Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

### Grid

- **Structure**: A 4x4 grid consisting of 16 cells.
- **Identification**: Rows labeled A to D; columns labeled 1 to 4.
- **Example Grid**:

  ```
     1   2   3   4
   +---+---+---+---+
  A|   |   |   |   |
   +---+---+---+---+
  B|   |   |   |   |
   +---+---+---+---+
  C|   |   |   |   |
   +---+---+---+---+
  D|   |   |   |   |
   +---+---+---+---+
  ```

### Tokens

- **Quantity**: Each player has 8 tokens.
- **Numbering**: Tokens are numbered from **1 to 8**.
- **Identification**:
  - Player 1's tokens are labeled as `P1-1` to `P1-8`.
  - Player 2's tokens are labeled as `P2-1` to `P2-8`.
- **Appearance**: In the command-line interface, tokens display the player number and token number (e.g., `P1-5`).

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player who goes first.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  - **Place a Token**: Place one of your unplaced tokens on any empty cell on the grid.
- **Token Placement**:
  - Tokens can be placed in any order, regardless of their numbering.
  - Once placed, tokens remain on the grid for the rest of the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Token Placement

- **Mandatory Move**: On your turn, you must place one of your available tokens.
- **Available Cells**: You can place a token on any empty cell.
- **Order of Tokens**: You may choose any of your unplaced tokens to play.

### Winning the Game

- **Primary Victory Condition**: Form a connected sequence of at least **three of your own tokens** in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) where the numbers form a strict ascending or descending order.
  - **Ascending Example**: Tokens `P1-3`, `P1-4`, `P1-5` in sequence.
  - **Descending Example**: Tokens `P2-7`, `P2-6`, `P2-5` in sequence.
- **Sequence Requirements**:
  - Tokens must be directly adjacent—no gaps.
  - The numerical sequence must be strictly increasing or decreasing without repeats.
  - Only your own tokens count toward your sequence.

### Blocking and Strategy

- **Blocking Opponent**: You can place tokens to block potential sequences of your opponent.
- **Shared Numbers**: Since both players have tokens numbered 1 to 8, anticipate which numbers your opponent may need.
- **Grid Awareness**: Pay attention to the grid to prevent setting up sequences for your opponent.

### Game End Conditions

- **Victory**: The game ends immediately when a player achieves the primary victory condition.
- **Secondary Victory Condition**:
  - **Tie-Breaker**: If all grid cells are filled without a player forming a valid sequence, the player with the **higher total sum** of their placed token numbers wins.
  - **No Draws**: If the sums are equal (highly unlikely due to token choices), the last player to place a token wins.

## Scoring

- **Primary Method**: Forming a valid numerical sequence as described in the winning conditions.
- **Secondary Method**: If no sequence is formed, the sum of your tokens on the grid determines the winner.
  - **Calculation**: Add up the numbers of all your placed tokens.
  - **Example**: If your tokens on the grid are `P1-2`, `P1-5`, `P1-7`, your total sum is 14.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Game Start

- **Player 1's Tokens**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Player 2's Tokens**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

#### Turn Sequence

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Places `P1-5` at **B2**.
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Places `P2-4` at **A1**.
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Places `P1-6` at **C2**.
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Places `P2-3` at **A2**.
5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Places `P1-7` at **D2**.

#### Game Analysis

- **Player 1's Tokens on Grid**: `P1-5` (B2), `P1-6` (C2), `P1-7` (D2)
- **Sequence Formed**: `P1-5` ➔ `P1-6` ➔ `P1-7` vertically aligned in ascending order.
- **Result**: **Player 1 wins** by forming the required sequence.

### Tie-Breaker Scenario

#### Grid Filled Without Sequence

- All cells are occupied, and no player has formed a valid sequence.

#### Tokens on Grid

- **Player 1's Tokens**: `P1-2`, `P1-4`, `P1-5`, `P1-7`, `P1-8`
- **Player 2's Tokens**: `P2-1`, `P2-3`, `P2-6`, `P2-7`, `P2-8`, `P2-5`

#### Sum Calculation

- **Player 1's Total Sum**: 2 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 = **26**
- **Player 2's Total Sum**: 1 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = **30**
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins** due to a higher total sum.

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

### Game Continuation

- Players continue to alternate turns, placing their tokens on the grid, aiming to form the required sequence while blocking their opponent.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Think multiple moves ahead to set up your sequence.
- **Block Opponent**: Watch your opponent's placements and use your tokens to block potential sequences.
- **Token Selection**:

- **Balance**: Use a mix of high and low numbered tokens to keep your options open.

## Summary

- **Simple Mechanics**: Easy to learn and play.
- **Strategic Depth**: Requires planning and foresight.
- **Quick Gameplay**: Designed to end swiftly.
