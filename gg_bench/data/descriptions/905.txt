# Factor Frenzy

## Objective

**Factor Frenzy** is a two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the last player to make a valid move by selecting numbers from a shared pool according to specific mathematical rules. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization:**
   - Create a shared pool of integers ranging from **2 to 30** (inclusive).
   - The numbers are available for both players to select during their turns.

2. **Starting Number Selection:**
   - Randomly select a **starting number** from the number pool to begin the game.
   - Remove the starting number from the poolâ€”it cannot be selected again.
   - This number becomes the **current number** for the first turn.

3. **Player Assignment:**
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Player 1 will take the first turn after the starting number is selected.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool:**
  - A list of integers from **2 to 30** inclusive.
  - Numbers are removed from the pool once selected and cannot be used again.

- **Current Number:**
  - The last number that was selected and is used to determine valid moves for the next player.

- **Players:**
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2** alternate turns.
  - Each player aims to select numbers that limit their opponent's options.

## Turns

### Turn Structure:

1. **Display Information:**
   - Show the **current number**.
   - List the **available numbers** in the number pool.

2. **Player Action:**
   - The player selects a **valid number** from the pool (see Rules and Mechanics for validity).
   - The selected number is removed from the pool.
   - Update the **current number** to the player's selected number.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - The turn passes to the next player.
   - Repeat the turn structure steps.

4. **End of Turn:**
   - If a player cannot select a valid number on their turn, the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must select a number from the pool that is either:
     - A **factor** of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
     - A **multiple** of the current number.
   - The selected number must be **available** in the number pool.

2. **Number Selection:**
   - You cannot select a number that has already been removed from the pool.
   - You must choose a number that meets the valid move criteria relative to the current number.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you **win**.
   - A player loses when there are no valid numbers for them to select on their turn.

4. **Examples of Factors and Multiples:**
   - **Factors:** Numbers that divide evenly into the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
     - Factors of 10: 2 and 5.
   - **Multiples:** Numbers that the current number divides evenly into.
     - Multiples of 5: 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.
