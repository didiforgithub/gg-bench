  - Attack values are chosen secretly each turn.

- **Command-Line Interface**:

  - The interface keeps track of HP and usage limits.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Simultaneous Selection**:
   - Both players **simultaneously** choose an attack value from **1** to **5** that they have remaining usages of.
   - Choices are made in secret and then revealed at the same time.
   
2. **Usage Tracking**:
   - After selection, players decrement the remaining usage count for the chosen attack value.
   
3. **Damage Calculation**:
   - Determine the outcome based on the selected attack values.
   
4. **Turn Progression**:
   - Repeat the process each turn until a player's HP is reduced to **0**.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Attack Selection**:
   - Players can only select attack values they have remaining usages of (each attack value is limited to **two uses** per player).
   - Selection is done in secret each turn.

2. **Revealing Choices**:
   - After both players have made their selection, choices are revealed simultaneously.

3. **Damage Resolution**:
   - **If attack values are equal**:
     - No damage is dealt by either player.
     - Both players proceed to the next turn.
   - **If attack values are different**:
     - The player with the **higher attack value** deals damage to the opponent.
     - **Damage Dealt**: Equal to the **difference** between the two attack values.
       - *Example*: If Player A selects 4 and Player B selects 2, Player A deals **2 damage** to Player B (4 - 2 = 2).
     - The player with the lower attack value does not deal damage.

4. **Health Points**:
   - HP is reduced according to the damage taken.
   - If a player's HP reaches **0 or below**, they lose the game.
   - HP cannot fall below **0**.

5. **Usage Limits**:
   - Each attack value (**1** through **5**) can be used **twice** per player during the game.
   - Once a player has used an attack value twice, they cannot select that value again.
   - Players must keep track of their remaining usages.

6. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player selects an attack value they have no remaining usages of, they forfeit the game.
   - It is crucial to track and remember the attack values used.

  - The game ends when a player's HP is reduced to **0**.
  - The player with remaining HP is declared the **winner**.

- The interface checks for remaining usages.
- Inputs are hidden to prevent the opponent from seeing the selection.

---

**Turn 1**:

- **Player A's Input**:

  ```
  [Player A] Enter your attack value (remaining usages shown):
  1 (2 uses left)
  2 (2 uses left)
  3 (2 uses left)
  4 (2 uses left)
  5 (2 uses left)
  > 3
  ```

- **Player B's Input**:

  ```
  [Player B] Enter your attack value (remaining usages shown):
  1 (2 uses left)
  2 (2 uses left)
  3 (2 uses left)
  4 (2 uses left)
  5 (2 uses left)
  > 4
  ```

- **Outcome Displayed**:

  ```
  Both players have chosen.
  Player A selected 3.
  Player B selected 4.
  Player B's attack is higher.
  Player B deals 1 damage to Player A.
  Player A HP: 9
  Player B HP: 10
  ```

*(Subsequent turns follow the same pattern, with the interface updating remaining usages and HP.)*

**Note**: Players should keep their selections concealed until prompted by the interface to reveal them.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Pay attention to the attack values your opponent has used to anticipate their possible choices.
  
- **Manage Resources**: Use your higher attack values wisely, as they are limited.

- **Bluffing**: Sometimes selecting a lower attack value can save your higher ones for critical moments.

- **Avoid Invalid Moves**: Keep track of your remaining usages to prevent automatic loss due to an invalid selection.
