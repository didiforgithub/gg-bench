The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` environment for the Crossed Paths game correspond to the 7x7 grid cells. There are 49 total possible actions, since the grid has 49 cells. Each index from 0 to 48 maps to a grid cell, where the index `i` represents the cell at row `i // 7` and column `i % 7`. For instance, index 0 corresponds to cell `A1`, index 1 to `B1`, ..., index 7 to `A2`, and so on, continuing across rows and down the columns of the grid.
