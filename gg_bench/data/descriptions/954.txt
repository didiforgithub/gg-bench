**Game Name**: **Ascending Challenge**

---

### **Objective**

Ascend to victory by being the first player to collect a sequence of three numbers in strictly ascending order from a shared pool. Use strategic selection to advance your sequence while hindering your opponent's progress.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Shared Pool of Numbers**: Arrange the numbers **1 through 9** in a shared pool accessible to both players.
2. **Player Order**: Decide which player takes the first turn (e.g., by coin flip). Players will alternate turns thereafter.
3. **Hands**: Each player starts with an empty hand that will hold their selected numbers in the order they are chosen.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Pool**: A collection of numbers from **1** to **9** available for selection.
- **Player Hands**: Individual sequences where each player accumulates their chosen numbers. Each hand can hold a maximum of **three numbers**.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - On their turn, a player selects **one number** from the **shared pool**.
   - The selected number is **added to the end** of the player's hand (sequence).
   - The chosen number is then **removed** from the shared pool and is no longer available.

2. **Hand Limit**:
   - Each player's hand can contain up to **three numbers**.
   - Once a player has three numbers, they do not take further turns.

3. **Order of Numbers**:
   - The sequence in which numbers are added to a player's hand is critical.
   - Numbers **cannot be rearranged** once they have been added to a hand.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Winning Condition**:
   - The **first player** to have **three numbers** in their hand that are in **strictly ascending order** (each subsequent number is greater than the previous) **wins the game**.

2. **Strategy and Blocking**:
   - Players may select numbers that not only benefit their own sequence but also prevent their opponent from completing an ascending sequence.
   - Careful observation of the opponent's hand can inform strategic choices.

3. **Tie-Breaker Rules**:
   - If both players complete an ascending sequence of three numbers in the **same number of turns**, the player who **moved second** (the player who took the second turn) **wins the game**.
   - If neither player achieves an ascending sequence by the time all numbers have been selected or all hands are full:
     - The player with the **longest ascending subsequence** in their hand wins.
     - If tied, the player with the **lowest sum** of their hand's numbers wins.
     - If still tied, the player who **took the last turn loses**.

4. **Game End Without a Winner**:
   - The game concludes when a player meets the winning condition or when both players have filled their hands without a winner, invoking the tie-breaker rules.

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**: The winner is the player who first meets the winning condition.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use points; it is a win/loss outcome based on achieving the objective.
- **Tie-Breakers**: Used only when necessary, as outlined in the rules.

#### **Example 3: Tie-Breaker Scenario**

- **Players' Hands at Game End**:
  - **Player 1**: [4, 6, 5]
    - Ascending subsequence: [4, 5]
  - **Player 2**: [7, 3, 2]

- **Tie-Breaker Application**:
  - Both have ascending subsequences of length **2**.
  - Sum of Player 1's hand: **15**
  - Sum of Player 2's hand: **12**
  - **Player 2** has the **lower sum** and **wins the game**.
