The action space indices range from 0 to 28, representing the numbers 2 to 30, respectively. Each index corresponds to selecting the number that is the index plus 2. For example, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 2 (0 + 2), and action index 28 corresponds to selecting the number 30 (28 + 2). This mapping allows players to choose numbers to eliminate consistently based on their position within the array of possible numbers.
