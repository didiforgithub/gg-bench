The action space indices in the gym environment map directly to potential moves in the game. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(101)`, meaning actions correspond to integers from 0 to 100. Each integer represents a potential proper divisor that a player could choose to subtract from the current number during their turn. However, only indices that match valid proper divisors of the current number are considered valid moves; all other indices are invalid within the game's rules. For example, if the current number is 100, valid actions might be 2, 4, 5, etc., while selecting any other numbers would be invalid.
