In the game, the action space indices represent the magnitude of force applied by a player to move the token towards their goal. The mapping is as follows:
- **Action index 0** maps to a force of **1** unit.
- **Action index 1** maps to a force of **2** units.
- **Action index 2** maps to a force of **3** units. 

These indices allow players to choose the strength of their move, ensuring a straightforward interface for selecting the force applied during each turn.
