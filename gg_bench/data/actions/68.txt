In the gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to the starting number (60 by default). Each action corresponds to subtracting a proper divisor of the current number. However, only the indices that match the actual proper divisors are valid moves. For example, if the current number is 60, valid actions correspond to indices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30, which are the actual proper divisors of 60. The action space includes all integers up to the starting number for simplicity, but only the valid divisors are meaningful in gameplay.
