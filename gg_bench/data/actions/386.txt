In the game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, meaning there are 9 possible actions indexed from 0 to 8. Each index corresponds to subtracting a number from 1 to 9 from the Current Number, where the chosen number is calculated as `action + 1`. Therefore, action index 0 corresponds to subtracting 1, action index 1 to subtracting 2, and so forth up to action index 8, which corresponds to subtracting 9.
