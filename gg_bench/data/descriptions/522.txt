# Prime Subtractor: A Two-Player Turn-Based Command-Line Game

## Objective

**Prime Subtractor** is a strategic two-player game where players take turns subtracting prime numbers from a shared total. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared total to exactly **zero**. Victory is achieved by careful calculation and foresight, ensuring you reach the target total before your opponent does.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Total**: The game begins with a shared total of **100**.
2. **Determine First Player**: Decide who will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a simple method like a coin toss.
3. **Prime Numbers List**: Familiarize both players with the list of allowable prime numbers for subtraction:
   - **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13**

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Total**: A single number that both players will subtract from, starting at **100**.
- **Prime Numbers**: The set of prime numbers between **2** and **13** (inclusive) that players can subtract:
  - **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13**
- **Players**: Two participants who will alternate turns.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen prime numbers.

---

## Turns

1. **Alternating Play**: Players take turns subtracting prime numbers from the shared total.
2. **Turn Actions**:
   - **Select a Prime Number**: On your turn, choose one prime number from the allowable list.
   - **Subtract from Total**: Subtract the chosen prime number from the current shared total.
   - **Update Total**: The new total becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.
3. **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until one player reduces the total to exactly zero.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Selecting Prime Numbers

- **Allowed Primes**: You may only subtract the following prime numbers:
  - **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13**
- **Reuse of Primes**: Prime numbers can be selected multiple times throughout the game.

### 2. Valid Moves

- **Positive Totals**: After subtracting, the shared total must remain **zero or positive**. Negative totals are not allowed.
- **Available Moves**: If no prime number can be subtracted without resulting in a negative total, the player loses their turn.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Exact Zero**: The player who reduces the shared total to **exactly zero** wins the game.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until a player wins.

### 4. Illegal Moves

- **Invalid Primes**: Selecting a number not in the allowed list of primes is prohibited.
- **Negative Totals**: Making a move that would reduce the total below zero is not permitted.
- **Repercussions**: Attempting an illegal move results in losing your turn.

### 5. Strategy and Tactics

- **Planning Ahead**: Anticipate future moves and the possible totals your opponent can achieve.
- **Control the Game**: Try to force the shared total into numbers that are advantageous for you and limit your opponent's options.
- **Mathematical Thinking**: Use basic arithmetic and understanding of prime numbers to guide your decisions.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Victory is achieved by the player who brings the total to exactly zero.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking; the focus is on reaching the game's objective.
- **Game End**: The game concludes immediately when a player wins.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Total**: 100

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1**:
   - Chooses **13**.
   - Calculation: 100 - 13 = **87**.
   - **New Total**: 87

2. **Player 2**:
   - Chooses **7**.
   - Calculation: 87 - 7 = **80**.
   - **New Total**: 80

3. **Player 1**:
   - Chooses **13**.
   - Calculation: 80 - 13 = **67**.
   - **New Total**: 67

4. **Player 2**:
   - Chooses **11**.
   - Calculation: 67 - 11 = **56**.
   - **New Total**: 56

5. **Player 1**:
   - Chooses **13**.
   - Calculation: 56 - 13 = **43**.
   - **New Total**: 43

6. **Player 2**:
   - Chooses **13**.
   - Calculation: 43 - 13 = **30**.
   - **New Total**: 30

7. **Player 1**:
   - Chooses **13**.
   - Calculation: 30 - 13 = **17**.
   - **New Total**: 17

8. **Player 2**:
   - Chooses **13**.
   - Calculation: 17 - 13 = **4**.
   - **New Total**: 4

9. **Player 1**:
   - Chooses **2**.
   - Calculation: 4 - 2 = **2**.
   - **New Total**: 2

10. **Player 2**:
    - Chooses **2**.
    - Calculation: 2 - 2 = **0**.
    - **New Total**: 0
    - **Player 2 Wins!**

### Invalid Move Example

**Current Total**: 5

**Player's Turn**:

- Attempts to subtract **7**.
- Calculation: 5 - 7 = **-2**.
- **Invalid Move**: Total cannot be negative.
- **Consequence**: Player loses their turn.

## Tips for Players

- **Memorize Prime Numbers**: Knowing the allowed primes helps make quick decisions.
- **Think Ahead**: Consider the possible totals after your move and how they will affect your opponent's options.
- **Avoid Negative Totals**: Always ensure your chosen prime does not reduce the total below zero.
- **Use Larger Primes Wisely**: Subtracting larger primes early can shorten the game but may open opportunities for your opponent.
