In the gym environment for Divisibility Duel, the action space consists of 9 discrete actions, indexed from 0 to 8. Each index in this space corresponds directly to a digit from 1 to 9 that can be used in the game. Specifically, action index 0 maps to digit 1, action index 1 maps to digit 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which maps to digit 9. This simple mapping allows players to select one of the available digits during their turn by choosing the appropriate action index in the environment.
