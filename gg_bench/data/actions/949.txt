In the game environment, the action space indices map to the moves as follows:

- The action space consists of 18 discrete actions, indexed from 0 to 17.
- Each odd index (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ..., 16) represents an "attack" using a digit, while each subsequent even index (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ..., 17) represents a "defend" with the same digit.
- Specifically, index \( n \) when divided by 2 (integer division) gives the corresponding digit minus 1. So action indices 0 and 1 both correspond to digit 1, where 0 is attack and 1 is defend. Similarly, indices 2 and 3 correspond to digit 2, with 2 for attack and 3 for defend, and so on up to digit 9 with indices 16 for attack and 17 for defend.
