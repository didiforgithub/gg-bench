# Crystal Clash: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Be the first player to reduce your opponent's crystal integrity points to zero.

Players engage in a strategic duel where they manage energy resources and choose actions to attack, defend, and outmaneuver their opponent. Victory is achieved by successfully depleting the opponent's crystal integrity while protecting your own.

---

## Setup

1. **Crystals**:
   - Each player starts with a crystal possessing **10 Integrity Points (IP)**.

2. **Energy Points (EP)**:
   - Both players begin with **0 Energy Points**.

3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Decide who takes the first turn (can be random or agreed upon).

4. **Game Interface**:
   - The game is played in a command-line interface where players input their chosen actions when prompted.

2. **Energy Points (EP)**:
   - Required to perform actions other than charging.
   - Players can have a maximum of **5 EP** at any time.
   - Displayed alongside crystal IP (e.g., `Player 1 EP: 3`).

3. **Actions**:
   - **Charge**:
     - Increases player's EP by **1**.
     - No cost to perform.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Energy Points (EP)

- **Accumulating EP**:
  - **Charge Action** increases EP by **1**.
  - Maximum EP is **5**; EP cannot exceed this limit.
- **Using EP**:
  - **Shield Action** costs **1 EP**.
  - **Attack Action** costs **2 EP**.
- **Insufficient EP**:
  - Players cannot select an action if they lack sufficient EP.
  - Attempting to do so prompts an error, and the player is asked to choose a valid action.

### Actions

1. **Charge** (`charge`):
   - Increases player's EP by **1**.
   - No EP cost.
   - Cannot increase EP beyond **5**.
   - Example:
     - `Player 1 EP before: 4`
     - `Player 1 uses Charge.`
     - `Player 1 EP after: 5`

2. **Shield** (`shield`):
   - Activates a shield that blocks the next incoming attack.
   - Costs **1 EP**.
   - Shield remains active until the player's next turn.
   - If multiple shields are activated consecutively, only one shield effect remains (shields do not stack).
   - Example:
     - `Player 2 EP before: 3`
     - `Player 2 uses Shield.`
     - `Player 2 EP after: 2`
     - `Player 2 Shield Status: ACTIVE`

3. **Attack** (`attack`):
   - Deals **2 damage** to the opponent's crystal.
   - Costs **2 EP**.
   - If the opponent has an active shield, the attack is blocked, and no damage is dealt.
   - Example:
     - `Player 1 EP before: 2`
     - `Player 1 uses Attack.`
     - `Player 1 EP after: 0`
     - `Player 2 Shield Status: INACTIVE`
     - `Player 2 Crystal IP reduced by 2.`

### Shield Mechanics

- **Activation**:
  - Shields are activated by using the `shield` command and paying **1 EP**.
- **Duration**:
  - The shield remains active until the start of the player's next turn.
- **Effectiveness**:
  - Blocks all damage from a single `attack` action.
  - After blocking an attack or when the player's next turn begins, the shield becomes inactive.
- **Limitations**:
  - Shields do not accumulate; activating a shield while one is already active does not extend or enhance protection.
  - There is no EP refund if a shield expires without blocking an attack.

---

## Scoring

- **Integrity Points (IP)**:
  - Each player's crystal starts with **10 IP**.
  - **When IP reaches 0**, the crystal is destroyed, and the player loses the game.
- **Tracking IP and EP**:
  - The game interface continuously displays the current IP and EP of both players.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to reduce their opponent's crystal IP to **0** wins.
- **Losing the Game**:
  - A player loses when their crystal's IP reaches **0**.
- **No Draws**:
  - There are no mechanisms in the game that allow for a draw; the game continues until one player wins.
