The action space indices in the game environment correspond directly to the numbers in the game pool, which range from 2 to 50. Since there are 49 possible actions (numbers), each index from 0 to 48 in the action space represents numbers 2 to 50, respectively. Specifically, index 0 maps to the number 2, index 1 to the number 3, index 2 to the number 4, and so on, up to index 48, which maps to the number 50. When a player takes an action, the selected index is translated into the actual game number by adding 2 to the index, ensuring the action reflects a valid move in the pool of available numbers.
