In the environment, the action space is represented by integers from 0 to 8. Each action index corresponds to a number in the game, where index 0 maps to choosing the number 1, index 1 maps to choosing the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 which maps to choosing the number 9. This mapping allows players to select numbers from 1 to 9 using their respective action indices in the environment.
