# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Divisor Duel is a two-player, turn-based game where players take turns reducing a shared positive integer by subtracting its proper divisors. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a move on their turn.

## Setup

- **Starting Number (N):** The game begins with a shared positive integer \( N \) greater than 1. It is recommended to start with a number like 30 for a quick game, but any integer greater than 1 can be used.

- **Players:** Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):** This is the current number in play. It is visible to both players and is updated each turn based on the players' actions.

- **Proper Divisors:** For any given number \( N \), its proper divisors are all positive integers less than \( N \) that divide \( N \) evenly (excluding 1 and \( N \) itself).

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately. Player 1 starts the game.

- **Player Actions:**
  - On their turn, a player must:
    1. **Identify the Proper Divisors of \( N \):** List all the proper divisors of the current number \( N \) (excluding 1 and \( N \)).
    2. **Choose a Divisor to Subtract:** Select one proper divisor from the list.
    3. **Update \( N \):** Subtract the chosen divisor from \( N \) to obtain a new \( N \).
    4. **Announce the Move:** Inform the opponent of the chosen divisor and the new value of \( N \).

- **Turn Progression:** The updated \( N \) becomes the current number for the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - A move is valid if:
     - The chosen divisor is a proper divisor of \( N \) (excluding 1 and \( N \)).
     - The subtraction results in a positive integer greater than 0.

2. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If a player cannot find any proper divisors of \( N \) (i.e., \( N \) is prime or \( N \) equals 1), they cannot make a move and lose the game.

3. **End of Game:**
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn. The other player is declared the winner.

4. **No Draws:**
   - There are no possible draw scenarios in Divisor Duel. The game will always result in one winner and one loser.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:** The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move wins the game.

- **No Points System:** Divisor Duel does not track points. Victory is determined solely by the ability to make valid moves.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number:** \( N = 30 \)

#### Turn 1:
- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - **Proper Divisors of 30:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
  - **Player 1 Chooses:** 15
  - **New \( N \):** \( 30 - 15 = 15 \)
  - **Announcement:** "I subtract 15 from 30. New N is 15."

#### Turn 2:
- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - **Proper Divisors of 15:** 3, 5
  - **Player 2 Chooses:** 5
  - **New \( N \):** \( 15 - 5 = 10 \)
  - **Announcement:** "I subtract 5 from 15. New N is 10."

#### Turn 3:
- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - **Proper Divisors of 10:** 2, 5
  - **Player 1 Chooses:** 5
  - **New \( N \):** \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
  - **Announcement:** "I subtract 5 from 10. New N is 5."

#### Turn 4:
- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - **Proper Divisors of 5:** None (since 5 is prime)
  - **Outcome:** Player 2 cannot make a move.
  - **Winner:** Player 1 wins the game.

### Command-Line Interaction

Below is a sample interaction between two players in a command-line interface:

```
Starting Number (N): 30

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 30: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter the divisor to subtract: 15
You subtracted 15 from 30.
New N is 15.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 15: 3, 5
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
You subtracted 5 from 15.
New N is 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 10: 2, 5
Enter the divisor to subtract: 5
You subtracted 5 from 10.
New N is 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 5: None
No valid moves available. Player 2 loses.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Depth

- **Understanding Divisors:** Skilled players will benefit from quickly identifying the proper divisors of numbers and anticipating future moves.

- **Planning Ahead:** By choosing specific divisors, players can manipulate \( N \) to prime numbers or 1 on their opponent's turn, forcing a win.

- **Control of the Game:** Players can strategize to control the flow of the game, deciding when to reduce \( N \) significantly or minimally based on the available divisors.

## Summary

Divisor Duel is a simple yet strategic game that involves number theory and foresight. It is easy to code and play in a command-line interface, ends quickly, and ensures that skilled players can consistently outmaneuver unskilled opponents through better understanding and planning.
