# Mirror Match

## Objective

**Mirror Match** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to create a palindromic sequence of numbers. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., `1-2-3-2-1`). Players achieve victory by strategically placing numbers to form such a sequence while preventing their opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

1. **Initial Sequence**: Start with an empty sequence.
2. **Number Pool**: Numbers from `1` to `9` are available for both players.
3. **Player Assignment**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: Digits `1` through `9`.
  - **Appearance**: Represented by their numeric digits.
  - **Functionality**: Numbers are used to build the shared sequence.
  - **Unique Attributes**: Each number from `1` to `9` can be used multiple times unless it's already in the sequence.

- **Sequence**: A list where numbers are appended.
  - **Functionality**: The central element of the game where players add numbers.
  - **State**: Updated after each turn to reflect the current sequence.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose any number from `1` to `9`.
  2. **Placement**: Decide to place the selected number at the **beginning** or **end** of the sequence.
- **Progression**: After placing the number, check for a palindrome. If none is formed, the turn passes to the next player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can select any number between `1` and `9`, regardless of how many times it has been used.
   - There is no restriction on reusing numbers within the sequence.

2. **Placement Options**:
   - **Beginning of the Sequence**: Place the number before all existing numbers.
   - **End of the Sequence**: Place the number after all existing numbers.

3. **Creating a Palindrome**:
   - A palindrome is formed when the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - The sequence must be at least three numbers long to qualify as a palindrome for victory conditions.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player creates a palindromic sequence on their turn, they win immediately.
   - The palindrome must be formed **after** the player's move, not before.
   - Players must be attentive to both offensive and defensive moves.

5. **Draw Condition**:
   - There is **no** draw mechanism. The game continues until a player wins.

6. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player does not add a number or tries to add an invalid number (outside `1` to `9`), they forfeit their turn.
   - Continuously making invalid moves may result in disqualification based on mutual agreement.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: Successfully create a palindromic sequence during your turn.
- **No Points System**: The game does not track points; it operates on a win/loss basis.
- **Game Length**: Designed to end quickly, typically within a few turns if played strategically.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Chooses number `4` and places it at the **end**.
- **Sequence**: `4`
- **Palindrome Check**: Not a palindrome (sequence too short).
  
#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Chooses number `5` and places it at the **beginning**.
- **Sequence**: `5 4`
- **Palindrome Check**: Not a palindrome.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Chooses number `4` and places it at the **end**.
- **Sequence**: `5 4 4`
- **Palindrome Check**: Not a palindrome.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action**: Chooses number `5` and places it at the **end**.
- **Sequence**: `5 4 4 5`
- **Palindrome Check**: The sequence is `5 4 4 5`, which is a palindrome.
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins**.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```plaintext
[Player 1's Turn]
Current Sequence: 
Choose a number (1-9): 3
Place at the (B)eginning or (E)nd? E
Updated Sequence: 3
No palindrome formed.

[Player 2's Turn]
Current Sequence: 3
Choose a number (1-9): 7
Place at the (B)eginning or (E)nd? B
Updated Sequence: 7 3
No palindrome formed.

[Player 1's Turn]
Current Sequence: 7 3
Choose a number (1-9): 5
Place at the (B)eginning or (E)nd? E
Updated Sequence: 7 3 5
No palindrome formed.

[Player 2's Turn]
Current Sequence: 7 3 5
Choose a number (1-9): 3
Place at the (B)eginning or (E)nd? E
Updated Sequence: 7 3 5 3
No palindrome formed.

[Player 1's Turn]
Current Sequence: 7 3 5 3
Choose a number (1-9): 7
Place at the (B)eginning or (E)nd? E
Updated Sequence: 7 3 5 3 7
Palindrome formed: 7 3 5 3 7
Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Pay attention to the sequence to block potential palindromic setups by your opponent.
- **Build Symmetry**: Aim to create symmetrical patterns that can lead to a palindrome on your next turn.
- **Control the Center**: Placing numbers to disrupt the opponent's plans can be as valuable as advancing your own.

## Conclusion

**Mirror Match** combines simple mechanics with strategic depth, ensuring that skilled players can consistently outperform unskilled opponents. Its ease of implementation in a command-line interface makes it an ideal choice for quick and engaging gameplay sessions.
