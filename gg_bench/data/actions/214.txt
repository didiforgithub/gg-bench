The action space indices in the game map to moves as follows:

- Indices 0 to 4 correspond to flipping a single bit at positions 1 through 5, respectively.
- Indices 5 to 14 represent all combinations of flipping two distinct bits:
  - Index 5: flip positions 1 and 2
  - Index 6: flip positions 1 and 3
  - Index 7: flip positions 1 and 4
  - Index 8: flip positions 1 and 5
  - Index 9: flip positions 2 and 3
  - Index 10: flip positions 2 and 4
  - Index 11: flip positions 2 and 5
  - Index 12: flip positions 3 and 4
  - Index 13: flip positions 3 and 5
  - Index 14: flip positions 4 and 5

This mapping allows for all possible legal moves in a turn, considering both single and double bit flips.
