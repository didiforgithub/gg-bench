The action space indices in the game environment correspond to possible divisors (D) starting from 2 up to 50. The indices range from 0 to 48, where each index n represents the divisor D equal to n + 2. For example, an action index of 0 corresponds to a divisor of 2 (0 + 2), an index of 1 corresponds to a divisor of 3 (1 + 2), and so forth, up to an index of 48 which corresponds to a divisor of 50 (48 + 2). This mapping allows players to select divisors for their moves by choosing the corresponding index in the action space.
