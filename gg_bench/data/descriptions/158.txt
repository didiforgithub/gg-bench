# Number Clash

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the target score by strategically selecting numbers to add to your cumulative total. The player who reaches or exceeds the target score first wins the game.

## Setup

- **Players:** Two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Target Score:** A predefined target score agreed upon before starting (e.g., 50).
- **Number Pool:** Numbers from **1** to **10** are available for selection.
- **Starting Conditions:** Both players start with a cumulative score of **0**.

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Score Tracker:** Keeps track of each player's total score.
- **Number Pool:** Digits from **1** to **10** that players can choose from during their turn.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Players input their choices through text prompts.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
2. **Action on Turn:**
   - **Select a Number:** Choose a number from **1** to **10** that hasn't been used by either player during the game.
   - **Update Score:** Add the selected number to your cumulative score.
3. **Turn Progression:** After a player completes their turn, the game prompts the next player.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Number Selection:**
  - On your turn, select an unused number from the number pool.
  - A number, once selected by either player, cannot be selected again in the game.
- **Cumulative Scoring:**
  - Add the chosen number to your cumulative score.
- **Winning the Game:**
  - The first player whose cumulative score **reaches or exceeds the target score** wins immediately.
- **Strategic Play:**
  - Players must plan their selections to reach the target score while potentially blocking their opponent.
- **No Draws:**
  - Since a player wins upon reaching the target score first, draws are not possible.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Scores:**
  - Players' scores are updated each turn based on their selected numbers.
  - Scores are displayed after each turn for both players.
- **Victory Condition:**
  - The game ends when a player's cumulative score is **greater than or equal to** the target score.
