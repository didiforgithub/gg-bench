In the provided gym environment for the game, the action space consists of discrete actions indexed from 0 to 7, which correspond to multipliers 2 through 9 in the game. The mapping is as follows: an action with index `n` (where `n` ranges from 0 to 7) is mapped to a multiplier of `n + 2`. This ensures that all valid multipliers (2 to 9) are represented by the integer action values within the defined action space.
