The action space in the game uses indices 0 to 29, which map to potential moves to Nodes 1 to 30 respectively. When a player selects an action, it corresponds to a move to `(action + 1)` because indices are zero-based while nodes are numbered 1 to 30. Therefore, an action of index `x` signifies a move to Node `x + 1`. Valid moves depend on the player's current node and the game's rules regarding multiples and factors, as well as avoidance of the opponent's current node.
