# Number Island: A Strategic Two-Player Game

## Objective

**Number Island** is a turn-based strategy game for two players. The primary goal of the game is to be the first player to capture the treasure located at the central cell of a 5x5 grid, representing an island. Players do this by strategically placing their markers on the grid to create a path to the treasure, while blocking and outmaneuvering their opponent.

Victory is achieved when a player successfully places their marker on the central treasure cell.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid representing the island. The cells are identified by their row and column numbers (from 1 to 5).

2. **Treasure Cell**: The central cell of the grid, located at position (3,3), is marked as the **Treasure**.

3. **Starting Positions**: Players choose their starting edge cells:
   - **Player A** uses the marker 'A'.
   - **Player B** uses the marker 'B'.
   - Each player begins by placing one of their markers on any cell along the perimeter (edge) of the grid.

4. **Initial Turn**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by a coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Game Board**: A virtual 5x5 grid with cells that can hold a single marker.
- **Markers**:
  - **Player A**: Uses marker 'A'.
  - **Player B**: Uses marker 'B'.
- **Treasure Cell**: The central cell (3,3), which players aim to capture.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with the player chosen to go first.
- On each turn, a player performs **one action**:
  1. **Place a Marker**: Place one of their markers on an empty cell that is adjacent (including diagonally) to a cell occupied by one of their existing markers.
  2. **Remove a Marker**: Remove one of their own markers from the grid.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Placing Markers**:
   - A marker can be placed on any empty cell adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a cell already occupied by one of the player's markers.
   - The first marker each player places (the starting position) can be any empty edge cell.

2. **Adjacency**:
   - Cells are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner.
   - Players build paths by placing markers on adjacent cells, aiming to reach the treasure cell.

3. **Capturing the Treasure**:
   - To place a marker on the treasure cell (3,3), the player must have at least one of their markers on a cell adjacent to the treasure cell.
   - The first player to place their marker on the treasure cell wins the game immediately.

4. **Removing Markers**:
   - Instead of placing a marker, a player may choose to remove one of their own markers from the grid.
   - This can be strategic, to reposition or to unblock potential moves.

5. **Blocking Opponents**:
   - Players may place their markers to block the opponent's potential paths.
   - Markers of different players cannot occupy the same cell.

6. **Valid Moves**:
   - If a player has no valid moves (cannot place or remove a marker), they forfeit their turn.
   - The game continues until the treasure is captured.

7. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player captures the treasure cell.
   - There are no draws; the game continues until a player wins.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who captures the treasure cell wins the game.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use a points or scoring system; victory is achieved by meeting the objective.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

**Initial Setup**:

- The 5x5 grid is empty except for the treasure cell at position (3,3).
- Player A and Player B decide who goes first (let's say Player A).

**Turn-by-Turn Example**:

1. **Player A's Turn**:
   - Chooses starting position at cell (1,1).
   - Places marker 'A' on cell (1,1).

   ```
   A . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . T . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . .
   ```

2. **Player B's Turn**:
   - Chooses starting position at cell (5,5).
   - Places marker 'B' on cell (5,5).

   ```
   A . . . .
   . . . . .
   . . T . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . B
   ```

3. **Player A's Turn**:
   - Places marker 'A' on cell (2,2), adjacent to (1,1).
   - Reason: Advancing toward the treasure.

   ```
   A . . . .
   . A . . .
   . . T . .
   . . . . .
   . . . . B
   ```

4. **Player B's Turn**:
   - Places marker 'B' on cell (4,4), adjacent to (5,5).
   - Reason: Creating a path to the treasure.

   ```
   A . . . .
   . A . . .
   . . T . .
   . . . B .
   . . . . B
   ```

5. **Player A's Turn**:
   - Places marker 'A' on cell (3,3), the treasure cell.
   - Cell (3,3) is adjacent to (2,2), which contains 'A'.
   - **Player A wins the game!**

   ```
   A . . . .
   . A . . .
   . . A . .
   . . . B .
   . . . . B
   ```

**Command-Line Interaction**:

- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Input: `place 1 1`
  - Output: `Player A placed an 'A' at (1,1)`

- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Input: `place 5 5`
  - Output: `Player B placed a 'B' at (5,5)`

- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Input: `place 2 2`
  - Output: `Player A placed an 'A' at (2,2)`

- **Player B's Turn**:
  - Input: `place 4 4`
  - Output: `Player B placed a 'B' at (4,4)`

- **Player A's Turn**:
  - Input: `place 3 3`
  - Output: `Player A placed an 'A' at (3,3)`
  - Output: `Player A has captured the treasure and wins the game!`

### Strategic Considerations

- **Building Paths Quickly**: Players should aim to create the shortest path to the treasure.
- **Blocking Opponent**: Placing markers to block the opponent's adjacency to the treasure can delay their progress.
- **Removing Markers**: Strategic removal can open new paths or reposition markers for better advantage.
- **Starting Position**: Choosing the optimal edge cell can influence the speed to reach the treasure.

## Conclusion

**Number Island** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent. With easy-to-understand rules and a clear objective, the game offers depth and replayability, ensuring that skilled players can consistently refine their strategies to achieve victory.

Players are encouraged to consider both offensive tactics (advancing toward the treasure) and defensive moves (blocking and delaying the opponent) to secure their path to victory.
