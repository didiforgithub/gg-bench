# **Digit Duel**

## **Objective**

Be the first to construct a three-digit number that is higher than your opponent's by strategically selecting digits from a shared pool and placing them into your number slots. The player with the higher three-digit number at the end of the game wins.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Shared Digit Pool**: A set of digits from **1** to **9** is placed in the shared pool. Each digit is available only once.

2. **Player Number Slots**: Each player has an empty three-digit number represented by placeholders:

   ```
   [ _ ] [ _ ] [ _ ]
   ```

   - The placeholders represent the **Hundreds**, **Tens**, and **Units** places, respectively.

3. **Starting Conditions**:

   - Decide randomly or mutually who will take the **first turn**.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Digits (1-9)**: These are the available digits that players can select to build their numbers. Each digit has the following attributes:

  - **Value**: The numeric value of the digit (1-9).
  - **Availability**: Each digit can be selected only **once** during the game.

- **Player Slots**:

  - **Hundreds Place**: The leftmost position in the number.
  - **Tens Place**: The middle position in the number.
  - **Units Place**: The rightmost position in the number.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players take turns in sequence, starting with the player who was chosen to go first during setup.

2. **Actions on a Turn**:

   - **Select a Digit**: Choose an available digit from the shared pool.
   - **Place the Digit**: Assign the chosen digit to one of the three places in your number: Hundreds, Tens, or Units.

3. **Placement Rules**:

   - Once a digit is placed in a position, **it cannot be moved**.
   - Each place can hold **only one digit**.
   - You must place a digit on each turn; skipping is not allowed.

4. **Turn Progression**:

   - After placing the digit, the turn passes to the other player.
   - The game continues until all players have filled all three places in their number slots.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Digit Selection**:

   - Digits are selected from the shared pool.
   - Each digit is available only **once**; once chosen by a player, it is **removed** from the pool.

2. **Number Construction**:

   - Players aim to construct the **highest possible three-digit number**.
   - Strategic placement is crucial; consider both your number and the potential numbers your opponent can create with the remaining digits.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - After all digits have been placed, compare the final three-digit numbers.
   - The player with the **higher number** **wins** the game.
   - There is **no possibility of a draw**; since all digits are unique and used, the numbers will always differ.

4. **Game End**:

   - The game ends immediately after both players have filled all three places.
   - The winner is declared based on the rules above.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory**: The player with the higher three-digit number at the end of the game.
- **No Points System**: This game does not use a points system; it's a win/lose outcome for each round.
- **Match Play (Optional)**: Players can agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.
