The action space indices in the CustomEnv environment map directly to the grid cells of the 3x3 game board as follows:

- Index 0: Cell (1,1)
- Index 1: Cell (1,2)
- Index 2: Cell (1,3)
- Index 3: Cell (2,1)
- Index 4: Cell (2,2)
- Index 5: Cell (2,3)
- Index 6: Cell (3,1)
- Index 7: Cell (3,2)
- Index 8: Cell (3,3)

Each index corresponds to a specific grid position where a player can place their marker, with the ordering matching a row-major format starting from the top-left corner of the grid.
