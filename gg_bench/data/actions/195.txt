In the gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices 0 to 4. These indices map directly to the numbers 1 through 5 that a player can select in the game. Specifically, an action with index `i` corresponds to selecting the number `i+1`. This means index 0 maps to number 1, index 1 maps to number 2, and so on, up to index 4, which maps to number 5.
