**Number Connect**  
*A Two-Player Turn-Based Strategy Game*  

---

### **Objective**

**Primary Goal:**  
Be the first player to create a contiguous sequence of numbers that sums exactly to **15** within a shared sequence built during the game.

**Victory Conditions:**

- **Win:** Form a contiguous subsequence that sums to 15 on your turn.
- **Loss:** If all numbers are exhausted without forming such a sequence, the player who placed the last number loses.
- **No Draws:** The game is designed so that a draw is not possible.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool:** Begin with numbers **1** through **9** available for selection.
2. **Shared Sequence:** Start with an empty sequence where numbers will be placed.
3. **Determine First Player:** Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2** (e.g., by a coin toss).
4. **Command-Line Interface:** Ensure both players have access to input commands and view outputs.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Numbers (1-9):**
  - Represented by digits **1** through **9**.
  - Each number is unique and can only be selected once.
- **Shared Sequence:**
  - A growing list where numbers selected by players are added in order.
  - Visible to both players after each move.
- **Players:**
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2**, taking turns alternately.
- **Command-Line Interface:**
  - The medium through which players interact with the game.
  - Displays available numbers, the shared sequence, and prompts for input.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
2. **Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Select a Number:**
     - Choose an available number from **1** to **9** that hasn't been selected.
   - **Place the Number:**
     - Add the selected number to the **end** of the shared sequence.
   - **Check for Victory:**
     - Analyze the shared sequence to see if a contiguous subsequence sums to **15**.
     - The subsequence must end with the number you just placed.
3. **Progression:**
   - If no winning sequence is formed, the turn passes to the other player.
   - Continue until a player wins or all numbers are used.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection Rules:**
   - Only numbers **1** to **9** are used.
   - Each number can be selected **once**.
   - Numbers are selected from the **remaining** pool.

2. **Sequence Building Rules:**
   - Numbers are added to a **shared sequence** visible to both players.
   - The sequence grows with each turn.
   - The order of numbers is important for forming sequences.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - After placing a number, check all possible contiguous subsequences ending with that number.
   - If any of these subsequences sum to exactly **15**, you win.
   - Only the player whose turn it is can win on their move.

4. **No Draw Scenario:**
   - If all numbers are used without a winning sequence:
     - The player who placed the **last** number **loses**.
     - This rule ensures that there can be no draw.

5. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Anticipate your opponent's moves.
   - Choose numbers that benefit you but avoid setting up your opponent.
   - Keep track of which numbers have been used.

### **Scoring**

- **No Points System:**
  - The game does not use points or scoring.
- **Winning:**
  - Victory is achieved by forming a valid sequence as per the rules.
- **Losing:**
  - Failing to form such a sequence before the numbers run out results in a loss for the player who makes the last move.
