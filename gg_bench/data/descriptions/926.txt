# Divide and Conquer: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

**Divide and Conquer** is a strategic two-player turn-based game. The primary goal is to be the first player to reduce a shared number to **exactly 1** by strategically choosing divisors. Players take turns dividing the current number by valid divisors, and the player who successfully reduces the number to 1 **wins the game**. If a player cannot make a valid move, they **lose**.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: Agree on a starting positive integer greater than 1 (e.g., 100).
- **Players**: Two players take turns—Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Starting Conditions**: The game begins with the current number set to the agreed-upon starting number.

## Game Components

- **Shared Current Number**: This is the number that players will modify during the game. It starts at the agreed-upon value and changes as players make their moves.
- **Divisors**: Valid divisors are integers greater than 1 that divide the current number evenly (without leaving a remainder).

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by a coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
2. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player must:
   - Choose a valid divisor of the current number (an integer greater than 1 that divides the current number exactly).
   - Divide the current number by this divisor.
   - Update the current number to the result of the division.
3. **Turn Progression**: The updated current number is used for the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Moves**:
  - A player must select a divisor greater than 1 that divides the current number without a remainder.
  - The divisor must be an integer.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who reduces the current number to exactly 1 **wins**.
- **Losing the Game**:
  - If a player cannot make a valid move because the current number is 1 or a prime number with no divisors greater than 1 (other than itself), that player **loses**, and the other player **wins**.
- **Example of Valid Divisors**:
  - If the current number is 10, valid divisors are 2 and 5.
  - If the current number is 15, valid divisors are 3 and 5.
- **Invalid Moves**:
  - Choosing a divisor that does not divide the current number exactly.
  - Selecting 1 or the current number itself as the divisor.
- **No Skipping Turns**: Players must make a move if a valid move is possible.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: Reducing the current number to exactly 1 on your turn.
- **Loss Condition**: Being unable to make a valid move on your turn.

There is no point-based scoring system. The outcome is a win or loss, making the game straightforward and focused on strategic play.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number**: 100

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current number: 100
   - Valid divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
   - Player 1 chooses **2**
   - New current number: 100 ÷ 2 = **50**

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current number: 50
   - Valid divisors: 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
   - Player 2 chooses **5**
   - New current number: 50 ÷ 5 = **10**

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current number: 10
   - Valid divisors: 2, 5, 10
   - Player 1 chooses **2**
   - New current number: 10 ÷ 2 = **5**

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current number: 5
   - Valid divisors: 5
   - Player 2 chooses **5**
   - New current number: 5 ÷ 5 = **1**

   **Player 2 wins by reducing the number to 1!**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Game Start! The starting number is 100.

Player 1's turn.
Current number: 100
Available divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
Enter your divisor: 2
New current number is 50.

Player 2's turn.
Current number: 50
Available divisors: 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
Enter your divisor: 5
New current number is 10.

Player 1's turn.
Current number: 10
Available divisors: 2, 5, 10
Enter your divisor: 2
New current number is 5.

Player 2's turn.
Current number: 5
Available divisors: 5
Enter your divisor: 5
New current number is 1.

Player 2 wins by reducing the number to 1!
```

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Players should anticipate future moves. For example, leaving the opponent with a prime number could force a loss.
- **Prime Numbers**: Be cautious when the current number is a prime number greater than 2, as options become limited.
- **Divisor Choice**: Selecting larger divisors may shorten the game but could lead to unfavorable positions.

## Tips for Players

- **Control the Game Flow**: Aim to force the current number into a state where your opponent has fewer valid moves.
- **Avoiding Primes**: Try not to leave a prime number for your opponent unless it results in a win for you.
- **Mathematical Strategy**: Familiarize yourself with factors and prime numbers to make quicker, smarter decisions.
