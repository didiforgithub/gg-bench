# **Tail End**

## **Objective**

Be the player to flip the last coin(s) from heads to tails. The primary goal is to strategically flip coins in such a way that you force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves except to flip the last coin(s), thereby securing your victory.

## **Setup**

- A straight line of **7 coins** is placed on a table or represented in the command-line interface.
- All coins are initially placed **heads up**, forming a sequence from **Coin 1** (leftmost) to **Coin 7** (rightmost).
- Players decide who will take the first turn (you can flip a coin, have the program randomly choose, or agree amongst yourselves).

## **Game Components**

- **Coins**: Seven coins arranged in a line. Each coin has two states:
  - **Heads Up (H)**: The coin is active and can be flipped.
  - **Tails Up (T)**: The coin has been flipped and is no longer active.
- **Game Board**: A visual or textual representation of the coin line, showing the current state of each coin. For example:
  ```
  [H][H][H][H][H][H][H]
  ```

## **Turns**

- Players take turns alternately.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Select a Coin**: On your turn, you must select one coin that is currently heads up.
  2. **Flip Coins**: Flip the selected coin and any immediate adjacent coins to its right that are also heads up. Flipping changes coins from heads up (H) to tails up (T).
 3. **Update the Game Board**: The game board is updated to reflect the new state after the flip.
- **Example Turn**:
  - **Before Move**:
    ```
    [H][H][H][H][H][H][H]
    ```
  - **Player 1 selects Coin 3**.
  - **Coins Flipped**: Coin 3, Coin 4, Coin 5 (since Coins 4 and 5 are immediate right adjacent coins that are heads up).
  - **After Move**:
    ```
    [H][H][T][T][T][H][H]
    ```

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Flipping Coins**:
   - **Mandatory Flip**: On your turn, you must flip **exactly one coin** that is heads up.
   - **Chain Reaction**: When you flip a coin, if there are any coins immediately to the right of the selected coin that are also heads up, they **automatically flip to tails** as part of your move.
     - The chain stops when it reaches a coin that is already tails up or there are no more coins to the right.
   - **Edge Case**: If you flip the **last coin (Coin 7)** and it is heads up, only that coin flips since there are no coins to the right.

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - You cannot skip a turn; you must flip a coin if there is at least one heads-up coin remaining.
   - If no coins are heads up at the start of your turn, the game ends.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who flips the last coin(s) from heads to tails **wins** the game.
   - If after your move all coins are tails up, you are declared the winner.

## **Scoring**

- No points are tracked in this game.
- Victory is determined by who flips the last coin(s) to tails.
- The game is purely strategic, focusing on making moves that force your opponent into flipping the last coin(s).

## **Example Gameplay**

### **Starting Board**:

```
[H][H][H][H][H][H][H]
```

### **Turn-by-Turn Example**:

#### **Player 1's Turn**:
- **Selects Coin 2**.
- **Coins Flipped**: Coin 2, Coin 3, Coin 4, Coin 5, Coin 6, Coin 7.
- **Board After Move**:
  ```
  [H][T][T][T][T][T][T]
  ```

#### **Player 2's Turn**:
- **Selects Coin 1**.
- **Coins Flipped**: Coin 1.
- **Board After Move**:
  ```
  [T][T][T][T][T][T][T]
  ```
- **Player 2 Wins** (flipped the last coin(s)).

**Note**: In this scenario, Player 1 made a move that allowed Player 2 to win. Strategic thinking is required to avoid setting up your opponent for a winning move.

## **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

### **Game Start**

```
Welcome to Tail End!

Initial Board:
[1:H][2:H][3:H][4:H][5:H][6:H][7:H]

Player 1, it's your turn.
Select a coin to flip (1-7):
```

### **Player Inputs**

- **Player 1 selects Coin 5**.

```
You selected Coin 5.

Flipping coins...
Coins flipped: 5, 6, 7

Current Board:
[1:H][2:H][3:H][4:H][5:T][6:T][7:T]

Player 2, it's your turn.
Select a coin to flip (1-7):
```

- **Player 2 selects Coin 3**.

```
You selected Coin 3.

Flipping coins...
Coins flipped: 3, 4

Current Board:
[1:H][2:H][3:T][4:T][5:T][6:T][7:T]

Player 1, it's your turn.
Select a coin to flip (1-7):
```

- **Player 1 selects Coin 2**.

```
You selected Coin 2.

Flipping coins...
Coins flipped: 2

Current Board:
[1:H][2:T][3:T][4:T][5:T][6:T][7:T]

Player 2, it's your turn.
Select a coin to flip (1-7):
```

- **Player 2 selects Coin 1**.

```
You selected Coin 1.

Flipping coins...
Coins flipped: 1

Current Board:
[1:T][2:T][3:T][4:T][5:T][6:T][7:T]

Player 2 flips the last coin(s) and wins the game! Congratulations!
```

**Analysis**: Player 1's move allowed Player 2 to flip the last coin. Careful planning is required to avoid such pitfalls.

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the outcome of your move and how it will affect the next turn.
- **Avoid Flipping Certain Coins**: Be cautious when flipping coins that will leave only a single heads-up coin for your opponent, as this may allow them to win.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into a position where they have no choice but to set you up for a win.

## **Additional Rules**

- **Invalid Input Handling**: If a player selects a coin that is already tails up or outside the range, prompt them again.
- **Termination**: If a player cannot make a valid move (all coins are tails up at the start of their turn), they lose the game.

## **Summary**

Tail End is a simple yet strategically rich game that requires foresight and careful planning. With only seven coins and straightforward rules, it's quick to play and easy to code for a command-line interface. The alternating turns and flipping mechanics create opportunities for players to outmaneuver each other and secure a win.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
