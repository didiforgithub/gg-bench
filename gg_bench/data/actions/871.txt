The action space in the game maps 18 discrete actions to possible moves, where each action index corresponds to selecting a number from `1` to `9` and placing it at either the beginning or the end of the sequence. The indices are as follows:

- Indices `0` to `8`: Select numbers `1` to `9` and place them at the beginning of the sequence.
- Indices `9` to `17`: Select numbers `1` to `9` and place them at the end of the sequence.

Each index `i` can be divided into:

- Number = `i // 2 + 1` (maps to the numbers `1` to `9`).
- Position = `i % 2` (`0` for the beginning, `1` for the end).
