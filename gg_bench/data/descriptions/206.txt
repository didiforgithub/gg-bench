# Factor Collapse

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
Be the player who reduces the shared total number to **1** by strategically subtracting proper divisors. The player who achieves this first **wins** the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they **lose** the game.

## Setup

1. **Initial Total:**  
   Begin the game with a shared composite number **T**, agreed upon by both players (e.g., **T = 30**).
   
2. **Player Order:**  
   Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Shared Total (T):**  
  A positive integer that both players will manipulate throughout the game. Initially a composite number (not prime and greater than 1).

- **Proper Divisors:**  
  Numbers that divide the total **T** evenly, excluding **1** and **T** itself.

- **Players:**  
  Two players who will take turns subtracting proper divisors from the shared total.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**  
   Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

2. **Actions per Turn:**  
   - **Identify Proper Divisors:** Determine all proper divisors of the current total **T**.
   - **Choose a Divisor:** Select one proper divisor to subtract from **T**.
   - **Subtract:** Reduce **T** by the chosen proper divisor.
   - **Announce Move:** Declare the chosen divisor and the new value of **T**.

3. **Turn Progression:**  
   The turn passes to the other player after a move is made.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**  
   - On your turn, you **must** subtract a proper divisor of **T** (excluding **1** and **T**).
   - The chosen divisor must be a positive integer that divides **T** without a remainder.

2. **Winning the Game:**  
   - If you reduce **T** to exactly **1** on your turn, you **win**.
   - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn (because **T** is prime or **1**), they **lose**.

3. **Invalid Moves:**  
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (no proper divisors exist), they **lose**.
   - If a player attempts to subtract an invalid number (not a proper divisor), they must choose a valid divisor.

4. **No Skipping Turns:**  
   - Players cannot skip their turn; they must make a valid move if possible.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**  
  The game is won outright by the player who reduces **T** to **1** or forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves.

- **No Points System:**  
  There is no point tracking; the game outcome is simply a win or loss.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Initial Total (**T**):** 30

**Player 1 Starts**

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Proper Divisors of 30:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 1 Chooses:** 15
- **Calculation:** 30 - 15 = 15
- **Announces:** "I subtract 15. New total is 15."

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Proper Divisors of 15:** 3, 5
- **Player 2 Chooses:** 5
- **Calculation:** 15 - 5 = 10
- **Announces:** "I subtract 5. New total is 10."

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Proper Divisors of 10:** 2, 5
- **Player 1 Chooses:** 2
- **Calculation:** 10 - 2 = 8
- **Announces:** "I subtract 2. New total is 8."

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Proper Divisors of 8:** 2, 4
- **Player 2 Chooses:** 4
- **Calculation:** 8 - 4 = 4
- **Announces:** "I subtract 4. New total is 4."

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Proper Divisors of 4:** 2
- **Player 1 Chooses:** 2
- **Calculation:** 4 - 2 = 2
- **Announces:** "I subtract 2. New total is 2."

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Proper Divisors of 2:** None (2 is prime)
- **Player 2 Cannot Move:** No valid proper divisors.
- **Player 2 Loses.**

**Player 1 Wins the Game!**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Assuming players input their moves in a command-line interface:

```
Game Start! Initial total is 30.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter the number to subtract: 15
You subtracted 15. New total is 15.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 15 are: 3, 5
Enter the number to subtract: 5
You subtracted 5. New total is 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 10 are: 2, 5
Enter the number to subtract: 2
You subtracted 2. New total is 8.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 8 are: 2, 4
Enter the number to subtract: 4
You subtracted 4. New total is 4.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 4 are: 2
Enter the number to subtract: 2
You subtracted 2. New total is 2.

Player 2's Turn:
No valid moves! 2 is prime.
Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:**  
  Anticipate the results of your move to avoid leaving your opponent with a winning position.

- **Prime Awareness:**  
  Try to force the total to a prime number on your turn, leaving your opponent without a valid move.

- **Divisor Selection:**  
  Choosing larger divisors can rapidly reduce the total, but consider potential repercussions.

## Conclusion

"Factor Collapse" is a game of numerical strategy and foresight. By understanding the properties of numbers and thinking ahead, a skilled player can consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent. The simplicity of the rules makes it easy to code and quick to play, providing an engaging challenge in a command-line setting.
