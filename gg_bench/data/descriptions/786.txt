# Seven-is-Forbidden

## Objective

The objective of **Seven-is-Forbidden** is to avoid being the player who creates a shared number divisible by 7. Players take turns adding digits to a growing number, strategically aiming to force their opponent into forming a number that is a multiple of 7. The player who, on their turn, creates such a number **loses** the game.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Starting Condition**: The game begins with an empty shared number (no digits).
- **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (can be determined randomly or by agreement).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer that both players build upon during the game. It starts empty and grows as players append digits.
- **Digits**: The numbers **1** through **9**. Players can choose any of these digits to add to the shared number on their turn. Each digit can be used multiple times without restriction.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display**: The current shared number is displayed to both players.
  2. **Action**: The current player selects a digit (1-9) to append to the shared number.
  3. **Update**: The shared number is updated with the new digit appended at the end.
  4. **Check**: The updated number is checked for divisibility by 7.
  5. **Result**:
     - If **not divisible by 7**, the game continues, and the turn passes to the other player.
     - If **divisible by 7**, the current player loses, and the game ends.

- **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - On their turn, a player must choose **one digit** from 1 to 9.
   - The chosen digit is appended to the **end** of the shared number.

2. **Building the Shared Number**:
   - The shared number grows with each turn as digits are added.
   - Example: If the shared number is `53` and the player adds `1`, it becomes `531`.

3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - After each turn, the updated shared number is checked to see if it is divisible by 7.
   - Divisibility is determined by calculating `shared_number % 7`.
   - If `shared_number % 7 == 0`, the number is divisible by 7.

4. **Winning and Losing**:
   - A player **loses** if they create a shared number divisible by 7 on their turn.
   - The other player is then declared the **winner**.

5. **Leading Zeros Prohibited**:
   - The shared number cannot begin with a zero. Players cannot select `0` as a digit.

6. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players must take their turn; skipping is not allowed.

7. **Digit Availability**:
   - All digits from 1 to 9 are always available, regardless of previous selections.

8. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player loses.

## Scoring

- **Single-Game Outcome**:
  - **Winner**: The player who **does not** create a number divisible by 7.
  - **Loser**: The player who creates a number divisible by 7 on their turn.

- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players may choose to play multiple games.
  - Keep track of wins and losses over several rounds to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game

#### Initial State

- **Shared Number**: (empty)

#### Turn-by-Turn Play

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Chooses digit `5`.
   - **Shared Number**: `5`
   - **Check**: `5 % 7 = 5` (not divisible)
   - **Result**: Game continues.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Chooses digit `3`.
   - **Shared Number**: `53`
   - **Check**: `53 % 7 = 4` (not divisible)
   - **Result**: Game continues.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Chooses digit `1`.
   - **Shared Number**: `531`
   - **Check**: `531 % 7 = 6` (not divisible)
   - **Result**: Game continues.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Chooses digit `4`.
   - **Shared Number**: `5314`
   - **Check**: `5314 % 7 = 0` (divisible)
   - **Result**: **Player 2 loses**. Player 1 wins.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Game Start!
Shared Number: [empty]

Player 1's Turn.
Choose a digit to append (1-9): 5
Shared Number: 5
5 is not divisible by 7. Game continues.

Player 2's Turn.
Choose a digit to append (1-9): 3
Shared Number: 53
53 is not divisible by 7. Game continues.

Player 1's Turn.
Choose a digit to append (1-9): 1
Shared Number: 531
531 is not divisible by 7. Game continues.

Player 2's Turn.
Choose a digit to append (1-9): 4
Shared Number: 5314
5314 is divisible by 7.
Player 2 loses the game. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Calculating Remainders**:
  - To play strategically, keep track of the remainder when the shared number is divided by 7.
  - Aim to select digits that leave a remainder that is advantageous for you and difficult for your opponent.

- **Forcing Moves**:
  - Try to force your opponent into a position where no matter what digit they choose, they will create a number divisible by 7.

- **Practice Mental Math**:
  - Improve your ability to calculate large numbers modulo 7 to enhance your strategic advantage.
