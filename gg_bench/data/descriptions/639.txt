# Shadows and Light: A Strategic Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

In **Shadows and Light**, two players engage in a tactical battle to control the majority of energy nodes on a grid-based board. The primary goal is to be the first player to capture a set number of nodes by strategically placing and moving your tokens while converting your opponent's tokens to your own. Victory is achieved by skillful planning and execution, allowing a skilled player to consistently outperform an unskilled one.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1 (Shadows)** and **Player 2 (Light)**.
- **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid representing the battlefield.
- **Starting Tokens**: Each player begins with three tokens.
- **Initial Arrangement**: The board starts empty. Players decide who goes first (e.g., by mutual agreement or randomly).
- **Starting Conditions**: Both players have their tokens ready to place on the board during their turns.

## Game Components

### Game Board

- **Grid Size**: 5 rows x 5 columns.
- **Nodes**: Each cell in the grid is called a "node," identified by coordinates `(row, column)` ranging from 1 to 5.
- **Representation**: Empty nodes are displayed as `.`

### Tokens

- **Shadows Tokens**: Represented by `S` on the board for Player 1.
- **Light Tokens**: Represented by `L` on the board for Player 2.
- **Functionality**: Tokens are used to control nodes and capture opponent's tokens.
- **Unique Attributes**:
  - Can be placed or moved to influence the board.
  - Capable of converting opponent's adjacent tokens.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player chosen to go first.
- **Actions Per Turn**: On their turn, a player must perform one of the following actions:
  1. **Place a Token**: Place one of their remaining tokens onto any empty node.
  2. **Move a Token**: Move one of their tokens already on the board to an adjacent empty node (horizontally or vertically).
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After performing an action, check for any captures (see Rules and Mechanics).
  - Update the board state.
  - The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Token Placement

- Players can place a token on any empty node.
- Each player has a limited number of tokens (three) to introduce onto the board.
- Once all tokens are placed, players must move tokens instead.

### Token Movement

- Tokens can be moved to an adjacent empty node (no diagonal moves).
- Moving a token counts as the player's action for that turn.
- Tokens cannot "jump" over other tokens.

### Capturing Tokens

- **Conversion**: If a player moves or places a token next to an opponent's token (horizontally or vertically), they capture it.
- **Capture Conditions**:
  - The opponent's token is immediately converted to the capturing player's token.
  - Diagonal adjacency does not result in a capture.
- **Chain Reactions**: Capturing can create new opportunities for additional captures in subsequent turns.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to control 13 or more nodes wins the game.
- **Alternate Victory**: If a player reduces the opponent to having no tokens on the board, they win immediately.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a tie due to the grid size and victory conditions.

## Scoring

- **Controlled Nodes**: Each node occupied by a player's token counts as one point.
- **Score Tracking**:
  - Scores are updated after each turn and any captures.
  - Both players can see the current scores before starting their turn.
- **Winning Score**: Reach 13 points to win the game.
