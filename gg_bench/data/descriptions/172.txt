# Modular Countdown

## Objective

The goal of **Modular Countdown** is to be the first player to reduce the shared counter exactly to zero after applying a modulus operation. Players take turns adding numbers to the counter, trying to reach zero in a way that forces their opponent into a losing position.

## Setup

1. **Choose the Modulus Number (N):** Agree on a positive integer greater than the maximum add number. For a quick game, set **N = 10**.
2. **Set the Maximum Add Number (K):** Decide on the highest number a player can add on their turn. For example, **K = 3**.
3. **Initialize the Counter:** Start the shared counter at **0**.
4. **Determine Turn Order:** Decide which player goes first. Players can flip a coin or choose randomly.

## Game Components

- **Shared Counter:** A numerical value that starts at 0 and changes as players add numbers.
- **Modulus Number (N):** A fixed positive integer that determines the modulo operation (e.g., N = 10).
- **Maximum Add Number (K):** The maximum positive integer that can be added to the counter on each turn (e.g., K = 3).
- **Allowed Add Numbers:** Players can add any integer from 1 up to K inclusive on their turn.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Select a Number:**
   - On your turn, choose an integer **a** such that **1 ≤ a ≤ K**.
2. **Update the Counter:**
   - Add your chosen number to the shared counter.
   - Apply the modulus operation:  
     **Counter = (Current Counter + a) mod N**
3. **Announce the Move:**
   - Clearly state the number added and the new value of the counter.

### Order of Actions

- Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- Each turn consists of selecting a number, updating the counter, and announcing the result.

### Turn Progression

- The game continues with players taking turns until one player reduces the counter to zero after their move, winning the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Adding Numbers:**
   - Players must choose a number between **1** and **K** inclusive.
2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - After adding your number, apply the modulus N to the counter:
     - **Counter = (Current Counter + a) mod N**
   - This keeps the counter within the range **0** to **N – 1**.
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player who reduces the counter to **exactly zero** after their turn **wins**.
4. **No Illegal Moves:**
   - Players must always make a move; skipping a turn or failing to add a number is not allowed.
5. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw. The rules ensure that a winner will emerge.

## Scoring

- **Winning:** The first player to reduce the counter to zero modulo N after their turn wins the game.
- **No Points System:** The game is a straightforward win/loss; no points are tracked.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Setup:**

- **Modulus Number (N):** 10
- **Maximum Add Number (K):** 3
- **Starting Counter:** 0

**Gameplay:**

- **Turn 1:**
  - *Player 1* adds **2**.
  - Counter: (0 + 2) mod 10 = **2**
  - *Player 1 announces:* "I add 2. Counter is now 2."
- **Turn 2:**
  - *Player 2* adds **3**.
  - Counter: (2 + 3) mod 10 = **5**
  - *Player 2 announces:* "I add 3. Counter is now 5."
- **Turn 3:**
  - *Player 1* adds **3**.
  - Counter: (5 + 3) mod 10 = **8**
  - *Player 1 announces:* "I add 3. Counter is now 8."
- **Turn 4:**
  - *Player 2* adds **2**.
  - Counter: (8 + 2) mod 10 = **0**
  - *Player 2 announces:* "I add 2. Counter is now 0. I win!"

**Result:**

- *Player 2* wins the game by reducing the counter to zero.

### Command-Line Interaction

```plaintext
Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 3: 2
Player 1 adds 2. Counter is now 2.

Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 3: 3
Player 2 adds 3. Counter is now 5.

Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 3: 3
Player 1 adds 3. Counter is now 8.

Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 3: 2
Player 2 adds 2. Counter is now 0.
Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate the counter values that will allow you to force a win.
- **Modular Arithmetic Understanding:** Familiarity with modulus operations can provide a strategic edge.
- **Control the Game Flow:** Try to manipulate the counter to values where your opponent has no winning moves.
- **Forced Moves:** Aim to put your opponent in a position where any move they make sets you up to win on your next turn.

By mastering these strategies, you can increase your chances of consistently winning against less skilled players.
