# Token Sprint: Rule Book

## Objective

**Token Sprint** is a competitive two-player turn-based game where each player aims to be the first to reach the end of a numbered path. The primary goal is to strategically move your token along the path to land exactly on the final position, **Position 20**, before your opponent does. Careful planning is required to navigate skip-turn positions and outmaneuver your opponent.

---

## Setup

### Game Board

- **Path Length**: A linear path consisting of positions numbered from **1** to **20**.
- **Starting Position**: Both players begin off the path at **Position 0**.

### Players

- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a unique token to represent their position on the path.
  - **Player 1**: Token `"X"`
  - **Player 2**: Token `"O"`

### Starting the Game

- Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be determined by mutual agreement or a simple random method (e.g., coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Path Positions**: Numbers **1** through **20**, representing the steps along the path.
- **Player Tokens**: Symbols representing each player on the path.
  - Tokens are moved forward along the path according to the rules.

---

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Movement Phase**: The player moves their token forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
  2. **Skip Mechanic**: If the player lands on a skip-turn position, they will miss their next turn.

- **Skip-Turn Positions**:
  - Positions that are **multiples of 5** (**5, 10, 15, 20**).
  - Landing on these positions triggers the skip mechanic.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

1. **Moving the Token**:
   - On your turn, choose to move your token forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
   - Movement must be within the path boundaries (Positions **1** to **20**).

2. **Exact Landing Required to Win**:
   - To win, you must land **exactly** on **Position 20**.
   - If you cannot move exactly to Position 20 on your turn, you must choose a smaller move or forfeit the move if no valid options exist.

### Skip-Turn Mechanic

- **Triggering a Skip**:
  - If you land on a skip-turn position (**5, 10, 15, 20**), you **skip your next turn**.
- **Consecutive Skips**:
  - Skipping turns can accumulate. If a player lands on multiple skip-turn positions consecutively (e.g., by opponent's missed turns), they skip the corresponding number of future turns.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to move their token to **Position 20** wins the game.
- **Invalid Moves**:
  - If a player cannot make a valid move without overshooting Position 20, they must pass their turn.

### Additional Rules

- **Passing Turns**:
  - If no valid moves are available (e.g., all options overshoot Position 20), the player must pass, and the turn goes to the opponent.
- **Skip Overrides Pass**:
  - If a player is supposed to skip a turn but has no valid moves, the skip is consumed, and play proceeds to the other player.

## Scoring

- **Winning**:
  - The player who reaches Position 20 first is declared the winner.
- **No Point System**:
  - There is no cumulative scoring; each game is a standalone contest to reach Position 20.
