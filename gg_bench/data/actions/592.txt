The action space indices are mapped to the game moves by representing each possible move as an index in a 49-element array. Each index in the action space corresponds to selecting a number from the pool of integers (2 to 50). Specifically, the action index `i` corresponds to choosing the number `i + 2`. This means that index 0 in the action space is mapped to the number 2, index 1 is mapped to the number 3, and so on, up to index 48, which is mapped to the number 50. This mapping allows each element of the action space to represent a distinct number in the game's number pool.
