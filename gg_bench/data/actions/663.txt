In the provided gym environment code for the "Battle of Divisibility" game, the action space is defined as a `Discrete` space with 9 actions, ranging from 0 to 8. Each action index corresponds to a Choice Number in the game, where:

- Action index 0 corresponds to Choice Number 1.
- Action index 1 corresponds to Choice Number 2.
- Action index 2 corresponds to Choice Number 3.
- Action index 3 corresponds to Choice Number 4.
- Action index 4 corresponds to Choice Number 5.
- Action index 5 corresponds to Choice Number 6.
- Action index 6 corresponds to Choice Number 7.
- Action index 7 corresponds to Choice Number 8.
- Action index 8 corresponds to Choice Number 9.

In essence, the action index, when increased by 1, maps directly to the available Choice Numbers (1 through 9) in the game.
