In the game, there are numbers 1 through 9 in the shared pool, which correspond to action space indices 0 through 8 in the environment. When a player chooses an action with a specific index \( i \), this action is mapped to the selection of the number \( i + 1 \) from the shared pool. For example, if a player selects action index 0, they are choosing the number 1; action index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which maps to number 9. Thus, the action space directly maps to selecting the respective number by its position in a 0-based index system.
