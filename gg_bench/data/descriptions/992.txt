**Sequence Duel**  

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to construct a sequence of three numbers where each number is a divisor of the next number in the sequence. The sequence must consist of numbers you've selected during the game. The first player to achieve this wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool**: A shared pool of integers ranging from **2 to 30**.
2. **Players**: Two players compete against each other.
3. **Starting Condition**: No numbers have been selected yet. All numbers from 2 to 30 are available in the pool.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**: A list of integers from 2 to 30. This is the shared resource from which players select numbers.
- **Player Collections**: Each player has their own collection of numbers they've selected from the pool.
- **Sequence**: A sequence of three numbers where each number divides the next (e.g., 2 divides 4 divides 8).

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.
2. **Actions Per Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: On your turn, pick any one available number from the number pool and add it to your collection.
3. **Turn Progression**: After a player selects a number, it's the other player's turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can choose any number from the pool during their turn.
   - Once a number is selected, it is removed from the pool and cannot be selected again.
2. **Building Your Sequence**:
   - Each player aims to collect numbers that can form a sequence where each number divides the next.
   - The sequence must consist of exactly **three numbers** from your collection.
   - Numbers in the sequence can be arranged in any order from your collection to satisfy the divisibility condition.
3. **Visibility**:
   - All selected numbers are visible to both players.
   - Players keep track of both their own and the opponent's selected numbers.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have three numbers in their collection that can form a valid sequence wins immediately.
   - If a player achieves this condition, they must declare it at the start of their next turn.
5. **No Draws**:
   - Since numbers are finite and the game ends when a player forms a valid sequence, there is always a winner.
6. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players can block opponents by selecting numbers they might need.
   - Pay attention to the numbers your opponent selects to anticipate their strategy.

### **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**: The game is won by achieving the objective before your opponent.
- There are no points or additional scoring mechanisms beyond winning the game.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Initial Number Pool**: 2 to 10 (for simplicity in this example)

#### **Turn 1**

- **Player 1** selects **4**.
  - Player 1's collection: [4]
  - Player 2's collection: []
  - Remaining Pool: [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#### **Turn 2**

- **Player 2** selects **5**.
  - Player 1's collection: [4]
  - Player 2's collection: [5]
  - Remaining Pool: [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#### **Turn 3**

- **Player 1** selects **6**.
  - Player 1's collection: [4, 6]
  - Player 2's collection: [5]
  - Remaining Pool: [2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#### **Turn 4**

- **Player 2** selects **10**.
  - Player 1's collection: [4, 6]
  - Player 2's collection: [5, 10]
  - Remaining Pool: [2, 3, 7, 8, 9]

#### **Turn 5**

- **Player 1** selects **12**.
  - Player 1's collection: [4, 6, 12]
    - Possible sequences:
      - **4 divides 12**, **6 divides 12**.
      - Arrange as [4, 6, 12]: 4 divides 6, 6 divides 12.
  - Player 2's collection: [5, 10]
  - Remaining Pool: [2, 3, 7, 8, 9]

**Player 1** declares a win at the start of their next turn due to having a valid sequence: **4 divides 6 divides 12**.

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Look for numbers that have common divisibility relationships.
- **Block Opponent**: If you notice your opponent collecting certain numbers, consider selecting numbers they may need.
- **Multiple Options**: Try to select numbers that offer multiple sequence possibilities.
- **Monitor Selections**: Keep track of both your and your opponent's numbers to anticipate and disrupt their strategy.
