**Game Name**: Parity Chase

---

## Objective

**Parity Chase** is a two-player turn-based game where each player aims to be the first to reach a total sum of **exactly 30** by selecting numbers of the same parity (all even or all odd) from a shared pool. A player wins by strategically selecting numbers to build their sequence while potentially limiting the opponent's options. A player loses if they exceed a total sum of 30 or cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Pool**: Begin with a shared pool of numbers ranging from **1 to 20** inclusive. All numbers are initially available.

2. **Player Sequences**: Each player starts with an empty sequence and a total sum of **0**.

3. **Determine Starting Player**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or a random method like a coin toss.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A shared list of integers from **1 to 20**.
  - Each number can be selected only once during the game.
  - Numbers are removed from the pool once selected.

- **Player Sequences**: Individual sequences where players accumulate their chosen numbers.
  - **Total Sum**: The sum of the numbers in a player's sequence.
  - **Parity**: All numbers in a player's sequence must be of the same parity (all even or all odd) after the first number is chosen.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately, starting with the player determined during setup.

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Review Available Numbers**: Player reviews the number pool for available numbers matching their required parity.
  2. **Select a Number**: Player selects one number from the pool that matches the required parity.
  3. **Update Sequence and Total**:
     - Add the selected number to the player's sequence.
     - Update the total sum of the sequence.
  4. **Remove Number from Pool**: The selected number is removed from the number pool.
  5. **Check for Victory or Loss**:
     - **Victory**: If the player's total sum is **exactly 30**, the player wins.
     - **Loss**:
       - If the total sum exceeds **30**, the player loses.
       - If no valid numbers are available to select on the player's turn, the player loses.

- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until a win or loss condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Parity Selection

- **First Turn**:
  - The first number selected by each player can be **any number** from the pool.
  - This number determines the **parity** (odd or even) for the player's sequence.

- **Subsequent Turns**:
  - Players must select numbers that match the parity of their sequence.
    - **Odd Sequence**: Must select odd numbers.
    - **Even Sequence**: Must select even numbers.
  - If no numbers of the required parity are available, the player loses.

### 2. Building the Sequence

- Players add the selected number to their sequence and update their total sum.

- The sequence and total sum are visible to both players throughout the game.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: A player wins immediately if their total sum reaches **exactly 30**.

### 4. Losing the Game

- A player loses if:
  - Their total sum **exceeds 30** after their turn.
  - They **cannot make a valid move** because:
    - There are no remaining numbers of the required parity in the pool.

### 5. Number Pool Management

- Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool and cannot be selected again by either player.

- Players should keep track of the remaining numbers to strategize effectively.

## Scoring

- **No Point System**: The game does not use a point system; instead, it focuses on reaching the target sum to determine the winner.

- **Victory**: Achieved by being the first to reach a total sum of **exactly 30** with numbers of the same parity.

- **Loss**: Occurs if a player exceeds a total sum of **30** or cannot make a valid move due to the unavailability of required numbers.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Keep track of the numbers that have been used and those remaining in the pool to plan future moves.

- **Parity Choice**: Choosing whether to go with odd or even numbers at the start can impact your chances based on available numbers.

- **Blocking**: Select numbers that your opponent may need to prevent them from reaching 30.

- **Risk Management**: Be cautious when your total sum is close to 30. Avoid selecting numbers that may cause you to exceed 30.

- **Forced Moves**: If possible, force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves left.

---

## Game Tips

- **Monitor Opponent's Sequence**: Pay attention to the parity and total sum of your opponent's sequence to anticipate their needs.

- **Balance Selection**: While blocking your opponent can be beneficial, ensure it doesn't hinder your own path to 30.

- **Stay Flexible**: Adapt your strategy based on the changing number pool and your opponent's actions.
