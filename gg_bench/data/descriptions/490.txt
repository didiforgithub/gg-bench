# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Be the player who forces the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move by reducing the shared number to a prime number on your opponent's turn.

**Victory Condition:**
- **Win:** You win if your opponent cannot make a valid move because the shared number is a prime number on their turn.
- **Loss:** You lose if you cannot make a valid move because the shared number is a prime number on your turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Shared Number Selection:**
   - Decide on a starting composite number (a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime). For a quick game, a number like **60** is recommended.
   - This number will be referred to as the **Shared Number**.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Players agree on who will take the first turn. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Game Interface:**
   - The game is played in a command-line interface where each player inputs their moves when prompted.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number:**
  - The central number that players manipulate during the game.
  - Starts as the chosen composite number (e.g., 60).
  - Gets updated after each valid move.

- **Proper Divisors:**
  - Numbers greater than 1 and less than the Shared Number that divide it evenly (no remainder).
  - Players select these to divide the Shared Number during their turn.

- **Players:**
  - Two players take turns making moves.
  - Each player needs the ability to input commands into the command-line interface.

## Turns

1. **Player's Turn Structure:**
   - **Display Information:**
     - Current Shared Number.
     - Available proper divisors of the Shared Number.
   - **Action:**
     - Choose a proper divisor of the Shared Number.
   - **Update:**
     - Divide the Shared Number by the chosen divisor.
     - The result becomes the new Shared Number for the next turn.

2. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns until the game ends.
   - No player may skip a turn; a move must be made if possible.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing a Divisor:**
   - On your turn, select a proper divisor of the current Shared Number.
     - A proper divisor is a whole number greater than 1 and less than the Shared Number that divides it evenly.
   - The divisor must be valid; it cannot be 1 or the Shared Number itself.

2. **Dividing the Shared Number:**
   - Divide the Shared Number by the chosen proper divisor.
   - The result must be a whole number (no fractions or decimals).

3. **Updating the Shared Number:**
   - The result of the division becomes the new Shared Number.
   - This updated Shared Number is used for the next player's turn.

4. **Prime Number Rule:**
   - If the updated Shared Number is a prime number, the next player has no valid proper divisors to choose from.
   - The player whose turn it is when the Shared Number is prime **loses** the game.

5. **No Repeats or Undoing Moves:**
   - Once a divisor has been used, it can be used again if it is still a proper divisor of the new Shared Number.
   - Players cannot undo or skip moves.

6. **Victory Condition Recap:**
   - You win if you pass a prime number to your opponent.
   - You lose if you're faced with a prime number on your turn.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome:**
  - The game ends when one player cannot make a valid move.
  - There are no points; the result is simply a win for one player and a loss for the other.

- **Match Play:**
  - For extended play, players can keep track of the number of games won.
  - The first player to reach a predetermined number of wins (e.g., best of five games) is the overall winner.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Starting Shared Number:** 60

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Available Divisors of 60:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1 Chooses Divisor:** 5
- **Calculation:** 60 รท 5 = 12
- **New Shared Number:** 12

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Available Divisors of 12:** 2, 3, 4, 6
- **Player 2 Chooses Divisor:** 6
- **Calculation:** 12 รท 6 = 2
- **New Shared Number:** 2 (a prime number)

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Shared Number is Prime (2).**
- **No Valid Proper Divisors Available.**
- **Player 1 Loses.**

**Outcome:** Player 2 Wins.

### Example Game 2

**Starting Shared Number:** 60

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Available Divisors of 60:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1 Chooses Divisor:** 4
- **Calculation:** 60 รท 4 = 15
- **New Shared Number:** 15

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Available Divisors of 15:** 3, 5
- **Player 2 Chooses Divisor:** 5
- **Calculation:** 15 รท 5 = 3
- **New Shared Number:** 3 (a prime number)

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Shared Number is Prime (3).**
- **No Valid Proper Divisors Available.**
- **Player 1 Loses.**

**Outcome:** Player 2 Wins.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start:**

- **Shared Number:** 60
- **Player 1's Turn**

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Display:**
  ```
  Current Shared Number: 60
  Available Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
  ```
- **Input Prompt:** `Player 1, enter your chosen divisor: `
- **Player 1 Inputs:** `5`
- **Calculation and Update:**
  ```
  60 divided by 5 equals 12.
  New Shared Number is 12.
  ```
- **Turn Passes to Player 2.**

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Display:**
  ```
  Current Shared Number: 12
  Available Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6
  ```
- **Input Prompt:** `Player 2, enter your chosen divisor: `
- **Player 2 Inputs:** `6`
- **Calculation and Update:**
  ```
  12 divided by 6 equals 2.
  New Shared Number is 2.
  ```
- **Shared Number is Prime.**
- **Player 1 Cannot Make a Move.**
- **Game Over:**
  ```
  Player 1 has no valid moves. Player 2 wins!
  ```
