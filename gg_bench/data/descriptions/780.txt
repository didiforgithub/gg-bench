# Pathway Pursuit Rule Book

## Objective

**Pathway Pursuit** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a 5x5 grid. The primary goal is to be the first player to create a continuous path connecting any two opposite edges of the grid (top to bottom or left to right), using numbers that sum to **exactly 15**. Each player places numbers on the grid, aiming to build their path while strategically blocking their opponent.

## Setup

- **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid with cells numbered from `(1,1)` to `(5,5)`, representing rows and columns.
- **Starting Conditions**: The grid is initially empty.
- **Player Symbols**:
  - **Player 1** uses the symbol `X`.
  - **Player 2** uses the symbol `O`.

## Game Components

- **Numbers**: Digits from **1** to **9**.
  - Each player has unlimited access to all numbers between 1 and 9.
  - Numbers are placed on the grid and are associated with the player who placed them.
- **Grid Positions**:
  - Each cell in the grid can hold one number.
  - Cells are referenced by their coordinates `(row, column)`.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions per Turn**:
  - **Place a Number**:
    - Select any unused, empty cell on the grid.
    - Choose a number from **1** to **9**.
    - Place the chosen number in the selected cell.
    - Mark the number with your symbol (`X` or `O`) to indicate ownership.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After placing a number, the turn passes to the other player.
  - Once placed, numbers remain on the grid for the rest of the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Building Paths

- **Objective Path**:
  - **Player 1** aims to connect the **left edge** to the **right edge**.
  - **Player 2** aims to connect the **top edge** to the **bottom edge**.
- **Creating a Path**:
  - A path consists of adjacent cells occupied by the player's own numbers.
  - Cells are considered adjacent if they touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - The sum of the numbers in the continuous path must be **exactly 15**.
  - The path must connect the player's designated opposite edges.
- **Blocking**:
  - Players can place numbers to block their opponent's potential paths.
  - Numbers placed by one player cannot be used in the opponent's path.

### Number Placement Rules

- **Number Selection**:
  - Players may choose any number from **1** to **9** on their turn.
  - There is no limit to how many times a number can be used in the game.
- **Cell Occupancy**:
  - Once a cell has a number placed in it, it cannot be changed or removed.
- **Ownership**:
  - Numbers are marked with the placing player's symbol and belong to that player.
  - Only a player's own numbers can be used to form their path.

### Victory and End of Game

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins immediately upon creating a valid path that meets the winning condition.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game continues until one player achieves victory.
  - With finite grid spaces and the blocking mechanic, a win is always possible.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Progress**:
  - Players should keep track of the sums of potential paths as they place numbers.
  - There is no point system; the game is won by achieving the objective.
- **Sum Calculation**:
  - Only include the numbers in the continuous path when calculating the sum.
  - The sum must be **exactly 15** to satisfy the winning condition.

## Example Gameplay

### Sample Grid Positions

```
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
(2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
(3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
(4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
(5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
```

### Sample Turns

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number **5**.
   - Places **5** at position `(3,1)`.
   - Marks it with `X`.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number **6**.
   - Places **6** at position `(1,3)`.
   - Marks it with `O`.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number **7**.
   - Places **7** at position `(4,2)`, adjacent to their previous `5`.
   - Marks it with `X`.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number **2**.
   - Places **2** at position `(2,3)`, aiming to connect to `(1,3)`.
   - Marks it with `O`.

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number **3**.
   - Places **3** at position `(5,3)`, connecting to `(4,2)`.
   - Marks it with `X`.

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number **7**.
   - Places **7** at position `(3,3)`, connecting to `(2,3)` and `(1,3)`.
   - Marks it with `O`.

### Evaluating for a Win

- **Player 1's Path**:
  - Numbers at positions `(3,1)`, `(4,2)`, `(5,3)`:
    - Sum: `5 + 7 + 3 = 15`.
    - Path connects from left edge (column 1) to right edge (column 5): **Not yet**.
    - **Player 1** hasn't won yet.

- **Player 2's Path**:
  - Numbers at positions `(1,3)`, `(2,3)`, `(3,3)`:
    - Sum: `6 + 2 + 7 = 15`.
    - Path connects from top edge (row 1) to bottom edge (row 5): **Not yet**.
    - **Player 2** hasn't won yet.

### Continuing the Game

Players continue to take turns, strategically placing numbers to complete their paths while blocking their opponent. The first to create a valid path that sums to exactly 15 and connects their designated edges wins the game.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Think multiple moves ahead to build your path efficiently.
- **Blocking**:
  - Anticipate your opponent's path and place numbers to interrupt it.
- **Number Selection**:
  - Use a combination of high and low numbers to reach the exact sum of 15.
- **Controlled Aggression**:
  - Balance between advancing your path and hindering your opponent.
