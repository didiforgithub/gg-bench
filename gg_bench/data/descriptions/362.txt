# **Factor Duel**

## **Objective**

Become the last player able to make a valid move by factoring numbers. The goal is to strategically factor numbers to force your opponent into a position where they cannot factor the current number because it is a prime number.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Starting Number (N):**
   - Agree on a starting composite number. This number should be an integer greater than 1 that is not prime (i.e., it has factors other than 1 and itself).
   - For a quick game, choose a small composite number (e.g., 30, 48, 60).
   - For increased complexity, select a larger composite number.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as flipping a coin.

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Set the **Current Number** to the starting number **N**.
   - Both players should have a way to perform basic arithmetic and factorization (e.g., paper and pencil, calculator, or mental math).

---

## **Game Components**

- **Current Number:**
  - A single integer that changes throughout the game based on players' moves.
  - Initially set to the agreed-upon starting number **N**.
  - The focus of each turn; players will factor this number.

- **No Physical Components Needed:**
  - The game is played using numbers and basic arithmetic operations.
  - Ideal for a command-line interface or textual interaction.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Player's Turn Structure:**
   - **Factoring:**
     - The player factors the **Current Number** into two integers greater than 1.
     - Both factors must multiply together to equal the **Current Number**.
     - Example: If the **Current Number** is 18, valid factors could be (2,9), (3,6).

   - **Selecting the New Current Number:**
     - The player chooses one of the two factors to become the **New Current Number** for the next turn.
     - The unused factor is discarded and plays no further role in the game.

2. **Passing the Turn:**
   - Once the **New Current Number** is selected, the turn ends.
   - The opponent's turn begins with the **Current Number** set to the chosen factor.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - Players must factor the **Current Number** into two integers greater than 1.
   - Both factors must be whole numbers; decimal or fractional factors are not allowed.
   - The factors cannot be 1 or the **Current Number** itself.

2. **Prime Numbers:**
   - If the **Current Number** is a prime number, it cannot be factored further.
   - The player faced with a prime **Current Number** and unable to make a valid move loses the game.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player who forces their opponent into a position where the **Current Number** is prime wins.
   - There are no draw conditions; the game always results in a win or loss.

4. **Forbidden Moves:**
   - Players cannot pass their turn; they must factor the **Current Number** if possible.
   - Providing incorrect factors or attempting to factor a prime number results in an immediate loss.

---

## **Scoring**

- **Win/Loss Outcome:**
  - The game is won by the last player to make a valid move.
  - No points are tallied; the outcome is simply a win or a loss.

- **Match Series (Optional):**
  - Players can agree to play a series of games.
  - Keep track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## **Examples**

### **Sample Game 1**

**Starting Number (N):** 60

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current Number:** 60
- **Possible Factors:** (2,30), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10)
- **Chosen Factors:** 6 and 10
- **Selected New Current Number:** **6**

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current Number:** 6
- **Possible Factors:** (2,3)
- **Chosen Factors:** 2 and 3
- **Selected New Current Number:** **2**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current Number:** 2
- **Since 2 is prime, Player 1 cannot make a move.**

**Result:** Player 2 wins the game.

---

### **Sample Game 2**

**Starting Number (N):** 105

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current Number:** 105
- **Possible Factors:** (3,35), (5,21), (7,15)
- **Chosen Factors:** 5 and 21
- **Selected New Current Number:** **21**

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current Number:** 21
- **Possible Factors:** (3,7)
- **Chosen Factors:** 3 and 7
- **Selected New Current Number:** **7**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current Number:** 7
- **Since 7 is prime, Player 1 cannot make a move.**

**Result:** Player 2 wins the game.

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the possible resulting numbers your opponent will face after your move.
  - Aim to leave them with numbers that are either prime or have limited factoring options.

- **Avoid Small Composite Numbers Early:**
  - Leaving your opponent with a small composite number (like 4, 6, 9) can backfire since they can easily factor them into primes that could be unfavorable for you.

- **Consider the Factor Pairs:**
  - Choose factor pairs that allow you to control the flow of the game.
  - Be cautious of selecting factors that lead to your opponent having an easy winning move.

## **Command-Line Interaction Examples**

### **Example 1**

```
Game Start! The starting number is 60.

Player 1's turn.

Current number: 60

Enter two factors of 60 (both greater than 1):

Player 1 enters: 6 10

Select the new current number (6 or 10):

Player 1 selects: 6

---

Player 2's turn.

Current number: 6

Enter two factors of 6 (both greater than 1):

Player 2 enters: 2 3

Select the new current number (2 or 3):

Player 2 selects: 2

---

Player 1's turn.

Current number: 2

2 is a prime number and cannot be factored further.

Player 1 cannot make a move.

Player 2 wins the game!
```

---

### **Example 2**

```
Game Start! The starting number is 105.

Player 1's turn.

Current number: 105

Enter two factors of 105 (both greater than 1):

Player 1 enters: 5 21

Select the new current number (5 or 21):

Player 1 selects: 21

---

Player 2's turn.

Current number: 21

Enter two factors of 21 (both greater than 1):

Player 2 enters: 3 7

Select the new current number (3 or 7):

Player 2 selects: 7

---

Player 1's turn.

Current number: 7

7 is a prime number and cannot be factored further.

Player 1 cannot make a move.

Player 2 wins the game!
```

## **Advanced Strategies**

- **Forcing Moves:**
  - Try to force your opponent into a position where all their potential moves lead to you having an advantage.

- **Controlling the Number Size:**
  - Keep the current number within a range that limits your opponent's options.

- **Memory and Calculation:**
  - Keep track of which numbers have limited factors to avoid accidentally giving your opponent an easy win.

---

## **Additional Variants (Optional)**

### **Variant 1: Multiple Starting Numbers**

- **Gameplay:**
  - Instead of starting with a single number, use a sequence of starting numbers.
  - Players alternate starting the game with different numbers, adding depth and variety.

### **Variant 2: Scoring System**

- **Gameplay:**
  - Assign points based on the difficulty of the win.
  - For example, winning with a larger prime number as the final **Current Number** earns more points.
  - First player to reach a predetermined point total wins the match.
