# Prime Subtractor

## Objective

Be the player who reduces the shared number to **exactly zero** by strategically subtracting allowed prime numbers on your turn.

## Setup

- **Shared Number**: The game starts with a shared number set to **50**.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer value that both players will manipulate during the game.
- **Allowed Prime Numbers**: The prime numbers you can subtract are **2**, **3**, **5**, and **7**.

## Turns

- The game is played between two players who take turns alternately.
- During your turn, you must subtract one of the allowed prime numbers from the shared number.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Subtracting Primes

- **Choose a Prime**: On your turn, select one of the allowed prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, or 7.
- **Subtract from Shared Number**: Subtract the chosen prime from the shared number.
- **Example**: If the shared number is 50 and you choose 7, the new shared number becomes 43.

### 2. Valid Moves

- **Non-Negative Result**: Your move is valid only if the shared number remains **zero or positive** after subtraction.
- **Invalid Move**: If subtracting your chosen prime results in a negative number, you must pick a different prime.
- **No Available Moves**: If none of the allowed primes can be subtracted without making the shared number negative, you lose your turn.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Exact Zero**: The player who reduces the shared number to **exactly zero** wins the game.
- **Forced Loss**: If you cannot make a valid move on your turn (no primes can be subtracted without going negative), you lose the game.

### 4. Game Progression

- **Turn Sequence**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.
- **Shared Number Update**: After each valid move, the shared number is updated and the turn passes to the opponent.

## Scoring

- No points are tracked.
- The goal is to be the player who successfully reduces the shared number to exactly zero.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

#### Starting the Game

- **Shared Number**: 50

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Action**: Subtract 5
- **Calculation**: 43 - 5 = 38
- **New Shared Number**: 38

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Shared Number**: 38
- **Action**: Subtract 7
- **New Shared Number**: 31

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Shared Number**: 31
- **Action**: Subtract 5
- **New Shared Number**: 26

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Shared Number**: 26
- **Action**: Subtract 7

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Think several moves ahead to anticipate your opponent's options.
- **Control the Game**: Try to force the shared number into values where your opponent has fewer options.
- **Avoid Negative Numbers**: Always ensure your chosen prime doesn't reduce the shared number below zero.
