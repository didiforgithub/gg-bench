# Number Duel

## Objective

**Number Duel** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach the **Target Number** exactly by strategically applying mathematical operations using your set of numbers, called **Action Numbers**. The player who reaches the Target Number first wins the game. Be careful not to exceed the Target Number; doing so results in an immediate loss.

## Setup

1. **Choose the Target Number**: Both players agree on a positive integer to serve as the Target Number (e.g., 15). This is the number players aim to reach.

2. **Select Action Numbers**:
   - Each player independently selects **three unique positive integers** between 1 and 9 (inclusive). These are their **Action Numbers**.
   - Players should keep their Action Numbers secret until revealed during the game.

3. **Initialize the Current Number**: The game starts with a shared **Current Number** set to **0**.

4. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide who will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared integer value updated by players' moves, starting at 0.
- **Target Number**: The agreed-upon positive integer that players aim to reach.
- **Action Numbers**: Each player's set of three unique numbers between 1 and 9.
- **Operations**: The four basic arithmetic operations—addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and integer division (/).

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **During a Turn**, a player:
  1. **Reveals and Uses an Action Number**: Chooses one of their unused Action Numbers.
  2. **Selects an Operation**: Chooses one of the four arithmetic operations.
  3. **Performs the Calculation**: Applies the operation to the Current Number using the chosen Action Number.
  4. **Updates the Current Number**: The result becomes the new Current Number.
- **Ending a Turn**: Once the Current Number is updated, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Action Numbers**:
   - Each Action Number can be used **only once** per player.
   - Once used, mark the Action Number as spent.
  
2. **Operations**:
   - Available operations are **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **integer division (/)**.
   - **Integer Division (/)**:
     - Division by zero is **not allowed**.
     - The result of the division is the integer quotient; any remainder is discarded (e.g., 7 / 3 = 2).
   - The operation combines the Current Number (on the left) with the Action Number (on the right).

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - On each turn, players must use an unused Action Number and a valid operation.
   - The operation is applied as: `Current Number [operation] Action Number`.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to update the Current Number to exactly match the Target Number wins immediately.
   - If a player's move causes the Current Number to **exceed** the Target Number, they **lose** immediately.
   - If both players have used all their Action Numbers without reaching the Target Number, the player **closest** to the Target Number without exceeding it wins.
   - If both players are equally close, the **second player** wins (to balance the advantage of going first).

5. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Victory**: Current Number equals Target Number.
   - **Defeat**: Current Number exceeds Target Number.
   - **End of Numbers**: All Action Numbers used; closest player to Target Number wins.

6. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Planning**: Anticipate future moves and the opponent's possible actions.
   - **Operations**: Choose operations that advance you toward the Target Number without risking an overshoot.
   - **Action Numbers Management**: Decide the optimal order to use your Action Numbers.

## Scoring

- **Winning a Round**: There is no point system; the objective is to win individual rounds.
- **Match Play**:
  - Players can compete in multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of rounds won to determine an overall winner.
  - Alternate who goes first in each new round for fairness.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Target Number**: 15

**Player 1's Action Numbers**: 2, 3, 5  
**Player 2's Action Numbers**: 1, 4, 6

**Current Number**: 0

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action Number**: 5
- **Operation**: +
- **Calculation**: `0 + 5 = 5`
- **Current Number**: 5

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action Number**: 6
- **Operation**: *
- **Calculation**: `5 * 6 = 30`
- **Current Number**: 30
- **Result**: **Player 2 loses** (Current Number exceeds Target Number).

**Player 1 wins the game.**

### Alternate Scenario

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action Number**: 3
- **Operation**: +
- **Calculation**: `0 + 3 = 3`
- **Current Number**: 3

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action Number**: 4
- **Operation**: *
- **Calculation**: `3 * 4 = 12`
- **Current Number**: 12

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action Number**: 5
- **Operation**: +
- **Calculation**: `12 + 5 = 17`
- **Current Number**: 17
- **Result**: **Player 1 loses** (Current Number exceeds Target Number).

**Player 2 wins the game.**

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

```plaintext
Welcome to Number Duel!
Target Number: 15

Player 1, enter your three Action Numbers (between 1 and 9, unique):
> 2 3 5

Player 2, enter your three Action Numbers (between 1 and 9, unique):
> 1 4 6

Starting the game. Current Number is 0.

--- Turn 1: Player 1 ---
Available Action Numbers: 2, 3, 5
Choose an Action Number to use:
> 5
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /):
> +
Calculating: 0 + 5 = 5
Current Number updated to 5.

--- Turn 2: Player 2 ---
Available Action Numbers: 1, 4, 6
Choose an Action Number to use:
> 4
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /):
> +
Calculating: 5 + 4 = 9
Current Number updated to 9.

--- Turn 3: Player 1 ---
Available Action Numbers: 2, 3
Choose an Action Number to use:
> 3
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /):
> +
Calculating: 9 + 3 = 12
Current Number updated to 12.

--- Turn 4: Player 2 ---
Available Action Numbers: 1, 6
Choose an Action Number to use:
> 1
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /):
> +
Calculating: 12 + 1 = 13
Current Number updated to 13.

--- Turn 5: Player 1 ---
Available Action Numbers: 2
Choose an Action Number to use:
> 2
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /):
> +
Calculating: 13 + 2 = 15
Current Number updated to 15.

Congratulations, Player 1! You have reached the Target Number and win the game!

## Tips for Strategic Play

- **Avoid Overshooting**: Keep track of how close you are to the Target Number to avoid accidental losses.
- **Use Multiplication and Division Wisely**: These operations can cause large jumps; ensure they won't cause you to exceed the Target Number.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Pay attention to the Action Numbers your opponent has used to anticipate their options.
- **Order of Operations**: Plan the sequence of your Action Numbers and operations to optimize your path to the Target Number.

## Summary

Number Duel is a simple yet strategic game that tests your arithmetic skills and strategic planning. With straightforward rules and quick gameplay, it's perfect for a fun challenge between two players in a command-line environment. Remember, every move counts—plan ahead and may the best strategist win!
