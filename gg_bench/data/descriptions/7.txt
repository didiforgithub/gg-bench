# Number Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Duel** is a two-player turn-based game where the goal is to strategically reduce your opponent's Life Points (LP) from 20 to **zero** before they do the same to you. Players draw numbers and decide whether to attack their opponent or heal themselves, making tactical choices to outmaneuver their opponent and claim victory.

---

## Setup

1. **Life Points**:
   - Each player starts with **20 Life Points (LP)**.

2. **Number Deck**:
   - Create a deck containing numbers from **1 to 10**, with each number appearing only once.
   - **Shuffle** the deck thoroughly to ensure randomness.

3. **Discard Pile**:
   - Initialize an empty discard pile next to the deck to hold used numbers.

---

## Game Components

- **Life Points (LP)**:
  - Represents each player's health status.
  - Both players start with **20 LP**.
  - LP cannot exceed **20 LP** at any time.

- **Number Deck**:
  - A set of cards numbered **1** through **10**.
  - Used for drawing numbers during the game.

- **Discard Pile**:
  - A place to store numbers that have been used.
  - When the deck is depleted, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

---

## Turns

### Turn Order

- Players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).
- Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.

### Turn Structure

1. **Draw Phase**:
   - The active player draws the top number from the number deck.

2. **Action Phase**:
   - The player chooses to either:
     - **Attack** the opponent.
     - **Heal** themselves.
   - The drawn number is used to execute the chosen action.

3. **Discard Phase**:
   - Place the used number into the discard pile.

4. **End Phase**:
   - Check for a win condition.
   - If no player has won, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Drawing Numbers

- At the beginning of each turn, the player must draw one number from the top of the deck.
- If the deck is empty:
  - Shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.
  - Continue drawing from the new deck.

### Actions

#### Attack

- Reduces the opponent's LP by the **full value** of the drawn number.
- Example:
  - If you draw a **7** and choose to attack, your opponent loses **7 LP**.

#### Heal

- Increases your own LP by **half** of the drawn number's value, rounded down.
- Example:
  - If you draw a **5** and choose to heal, you gain **2 LP** (since 5 / 2 = 2.5, rounded down to 2).

### Life Points Management

- A player's LP cannot exceed **20 LP**.
- If a player's LP falls to **0 LP** or below, they lose the game immediately.

### Game End Conditions

- **Victory**:
  - Achieved when the opponent's LP is reduced to **0 LP** or below.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game continues until one player wins; there are no conditions for a draw.

### Restrictions

- Players **must** choose to either attack or heal each turn.
- **Skipping a turn** is not allowed.

---

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**:
  - The game is won by reducing your opponent's LP to zero or below.
  - The game is lost if your own LP is reduced to zero or below.
- **No Point System**:
  - There are no cumulative points; the focus is solely on each player's current LP.
