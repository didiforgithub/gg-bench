In the game environment, each action space index directly maps to a number in the Number Set. Specifically, the action index `i` represents the move of selecting the number `i + 1`. This mapping ensures that the action at index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `1`, the action at index `1` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, and so forth up to the maximum action index `N-1`, which corresponds to the number `N`. This alignment between indices and game numbers simplifies the selection process by allowing players to choose a number through its designated index in the action space.
