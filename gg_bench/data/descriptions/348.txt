# Number Snatch: Rule Book

---

## Objective

**Number Snatch** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to accumulate the highest total score by strategically selecting numbers from a shared list while employing the "Snatch" mechanic to reduce your opponent's score and enhance your own. The game ends when all numbers have been selected, and the player with the highest score is declared the winner. There are no draws in Number Snatch.

## Setup

1. **Generate the Number List**:

   - At the beginning of the game, a shared list of **10 unique positive integers** ranging from **1 to 20** is randomly generated.
   - Example Number List: `[2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20]`

2. **Initialize Player Scores**:

   - Both players start with a score of **zero**.
   - Player identifiers are established as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

3. **Determine Turn Order**:

   - Decide which player takes the first turn. This can be done randomly or by agreement.
   - The game proceeds with players alternating turns.

## Game Components

1. **Number List**:

   - A shared list of **10 unique positive integers** between **1 and 20**.
   - Numbers are displayed to both players at all times.
   - Once a number is selected, it is removed from the list and is no longer available.

2. **Player Scores**:

   - Each player has an individual score that is updated throughout the game.
   - Scores reflect the sum of numbers selected and any points gained or lost through the Snatch mechanic.

3. **Snatch Mechanic**:

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection

- **Unique Selection**: Each number in the Number List can be selected only once.
- **Available Numbers**: Players can only select from the current Number List displayed at the start of their turn.

### 2. Scoring Points

- **Adding to Score**: The number a player selects is added to their personal score.
- **Score Visibility**: Both players' scores are visible to each other after each turn.

### 3. Snatch Mechanic

- **Triggering a Snatch**:

  - A Snatch occurs when the number a player selects is a **multiple** of the **last number selected by their opponent**.
  - Formula: `If Player's Selected Number % Opponent's Last Selected Number == 0`

- **Snatch Effects**:

  - **Opponent's Score Reduction**:

    - The opponent loses points equal to their last selected number.
    - The opponent's score cannot go below zero. If the deduction exceeds their current score, their score becomes zero.

  - **Player's Score Increase**:

    - The player gains points equal to the actual points deducted from the opponent.
    - This represents the "snatched" points.

- **Example**:

  - Opponent's Last Number: `5`
  - Player Selects: `15` (which is a multiple of `5`)
  - Snatch Occurs:
    - Opponent loses `5` points (their last number).
    - Player gains `5` points.

### 4. Game End and Victory

- **Game Conclusion**:

  - The game ends when all numbers have been selected from the Number List.

- **Determining the Winner**:

  - The player with the **highest total score** at the end of the game wins.
  - There are no draws; ties are impossible due to the game's mechanics and the Snatch feature.

- **Victory Conditions**:

  - **Skilled Play**: Strategic selection and utilization of the Snatch mechanic can provide a significant advantage.
  - **Consistent Winning**: A skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player by anticipating moves and maximizing Snatch opportunities.

## Scoring

- **Score Components**:

  - **Selected Numbers**: Sum of all numbers a player has selected.
  - **Snatch Gains**: Points gained from the opponent through Snatches.
  - **Snatch Losses**: Points lost due to the opponent's Snatches.

- **Score Calculation**:

  ```
  Player's Score = (Sum of Selected Numbers) + (Snatch Gains) - (Snatch Losses)
  ```

- **Score Tracking**:

  - Scores are updated and displayed after each turn.
  - Both players can see the current scores and plan their strategies accordingly.
