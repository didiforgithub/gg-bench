In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 19, corresponding to the numbers 1 through 20. Specifically, an action `a` maps to the number `a + 1`. This means that an action index of 0 represents the number 1, an action index of 1 represents the number 2, and so on, up to an action index of 19 representing the number 20. This mapping allows each index to directly correspond to one of the numbers in the number pool, and ensures that selecting an index from the action space equates to choosing a specific number to add to the sequence during the game.
