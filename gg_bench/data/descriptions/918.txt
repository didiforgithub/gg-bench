# Multiplication Showdown

## Rule Book

### Objective

**Multiplication Showdown** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach or exceed a target product by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool. Players take turns multiplying their current product by an available number, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent and achieve victory.

### Setup

1. **Target Product**: Decide on a target product that players aim to reach. The default target is **100**.

2. **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9**. Each number can be used only once per game.

3. **Starting Product**: Both players begin with a personal product of **1**.

4. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

### Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**: A list of numbers from **1** to **9** available for selection.
- **Player Products**: Each player has a personal running product, starting at **1**.
- **Target Product**: The predetermined product value that players aim to reach or exceed.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played through text-based inputs and outputs.

### Turns

1. **Turn Sequence**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
   - On each turn, the active player performs the following steps:
     - **Display Information**: The current state is shown, including available numbers and both players' products.
     - **Select a Number**: Choose one number from the shared pool.
     - **Update Product**: Multiply the chosen number by the player's current product.
     - **Update Number Pool**: Remove the chosen number from the pool.
     - **Check for Win**: Determine if the new product meets or exceeds the target.

2. **Example Turn Structure**:

   ```
   Available Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
   Your Current Product: 1
   Opponent's Product: 1
   Select a number to multiply: 5
   You selected 5.
   Your New Product: 5
   ```

### Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players must choose a number from the **available numbers**.
   - Each number can only be chosen **once per game**.
   - If a player attempts to select an unavailable number, they are prompted to choose again.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - Players start with a product of **1**.
   - On their turn, they **multiply** their current product by the chosen number.
   - Example: If a player's product is **6** and they choose **4**, their new product is **24** (6 × 4).

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to **reach or exceed** the **target product** wins the game immediately.
   - If both players reach or exceed the target product in the same round, the **player with the higher product** wins.
   - If all numbers are used without either player reaching the target, the player with the **higher product** wins.

4. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Victory**: A player wins upon meeting the winning criteria.
   - **No Draws**: There are no draw conditions; every game ends with a winner.

5. **Strategy Notes**:
   - Players must balance between selecting high numbers to boost their product and blocking the opponent's potential moves.
   - Keeping track of the opponent's product can inform strategic choices.

### Scoring

- **Win**: Achieved by reaching or exceeding the target product first.
- **Tie-Breaker**: If both players exceed the target in the same round, the higher product wins.
- **Final Products**: Can be used to track performance over multiple games or to set personal bests.

- **Blocking Opponent**: Choose numbers that might benefit your opponent if left unselected.
- **Product Management**: Avoid overreaching the target by too much, as a minimal win can be strategically safer.

### Variations

- **Adjusted Target**: Changing the target product can alter game length and complexity.
- **Expanded Number Pool**: Including numbers beyond 9 for a more extended game.
- **Limited Selection**: Restricting the number of picks to increase difficulty.
