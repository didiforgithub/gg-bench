# **Grid Block**

## **Objective**

**Grid Block** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a 4x4 grid. The primary goal is to be the last player able to place a piece on the grid following the placement rules. Players take turns placing their unique pieces on the grid, aiming to block their opponent's options while maximizing their own. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses the game.

## **Setup**

- **Game Board**: A 4x4 grid consisting of 16 cells arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns.
- **Player Pieces**:
  - **Player 1**: Uses the symbol `'X'`.
  - **Player 2**: Uses the symbol `'O'`.
- **Starting Conditions**:
  - The grid is empty at the beginning of the game.
  - Decide which player takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

## **Game Components**

- **4x4 Grid**:
  - Represents the game board with positions labeled by their row and column indices (both ranging from 0 to 3).
  - Each cell can be empty `'.'` or contain a player's piece.

- **Player Pieces**:
  - **'X'** for Player 1.
  - **'O'** for Player 2.
  - Pieces are placed on the grid and remain stationary for the duration of the game.

## **Turns**

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns starting with the player decided during setup.
  
- **Player Actions During a Turn**:
  1. **Input Move**:
     - The player selects an empty cell to place their piece by specifying the row and column indices.
  2. **Validation**:
     - The chosen cell must not be adjacent (including diagonally) to any of the player's own pieces already on the board.
     - If no valid moves are available, the player loses.
  3. **Place Piece**:
     - The player's piece is placed in the valid selected cell.
  4. **Update Board**:
     - The grid is updated to reflect the new piece placement.
  5. **Turn Completion**:
     - The turn ends, and control passes to the opponent.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **1. Placement Rule**

- **Valid Placement**:
  - A piece must be placed on an **empty cell**.
  - The selected cell **must not** be adjacent to any of the player's own pieces.
    - **Adjacent cells** include all cells surrounding a piece horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - It is **permissible** to place a piece adjacent to the opponent's pieces.

### **2. Winning the Game**

- **Victory Condition**:
  - A player wins if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn according to the placement rules.
- **Losing the Game**:
  - A player loses if they have no valid cells to place their piece when it's their turn.

### **3. Game Progression**

- The game continues with players alternating turns and placing their pieces while adhering to the placement rule.
- Strategic placement is crucial to limit the opponent's options while keeping one's own options open.
