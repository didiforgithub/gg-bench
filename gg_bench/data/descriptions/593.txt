# Prime Reduction

Prime Reduction is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. Players take turns reducing a shared number by dividing it with prime numbers, aiming to force their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. The game is simple to code, ends quickly, and relies on strategic thinking, ensuring that a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled opponent.

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the shared number to **1** on your turn, or force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. A valid move consists of dividing the current number by an allowed prime divisor. Winning requires careful selection of divisors to control the flow of the game and outmaneuver your opponent.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer **N**. The default starting number is **60**, but players can agree on any suitable starting number greater than **1**.
- **Allowed Primes**: The prime numbers allowed for division are **2**, **3**, **5**, and **7**.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that both players will manipulate during the game.
- **Allowed Primes**: The set of prime numbers \[2, 3, 5, 7\] that can be used to divide **N**.
- **Player Indicators**: Denote players as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by a coin toss). Turns alternate between players.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Choose a Divisor**: Select a prime number from the allowed set that divides **N** exactly.
  2. **Divide N**: Update **N** by dividing it by the chosen prime number.
  3. **Announce Move**: Declare the chosen prime and the new value of **N**.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you **must** divide **N** by one of the allowed primes \[2, 3, 5, 7\].
   - The chosen prime must divide **N** exactly (i.e., **N mod prime == 0**).
2. **Updating N**:
   - After division, **N** becomes the quotient of the division.
   - Example: If **N = 60** and you divide by **5**, the new **N** is **12**.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Objective Victory**: If you reduce **N** to **1** on your turn, you win the game.
   - **Forced Victory**: If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn (i.e., no allowed primes divide **N** exactly), you win the game.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn, you lose the game.
5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - You cannot pass or skip your turn. If a valid move is possible, you must make one.
6. **Allowed Primes Only**:
   - Division by primes outside the allowed set \[2, 3, 5, 7\] is not permitted, even if they divide **N** exactly.

## Scoring

- The game is won by the player who achieves the **Objective Victory** or **Forced Victory** conditions.
- No points are tracked beyond determining the winner of each game.
- Players may keep track of wins over multiple games for match play.

## Examples

### Example 1: Strategic Play

**Starting N = 60**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to divide by **5**.
  - **N** becomes **12** (60 รท 5).
  - Announces: "Divided by 5, N is now 12."
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to divide by **2**.
  - **N** becomes **6** (12 รท 2).
  - Announces: "Divided by 2, N is now 6."
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to divide by **2**.
  - **N** becomes **3** (6 รท 2).
  - Announces: "Divided by 2, N is now 3."
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to divide by **3**.
  - **N** becomes **1** (3 รท 3).
  - Announces: "Divided by 3, N is now 1. I win!"

**Result**: Player 2 wins by reducing **N** to **1**.

### Example 2: Forced Victory

**Starting N = 52**

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Divides by **2**.
  - **N** becomes **26**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Divides by **2**.
  - **N** becomes **13**.
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Attempts to find a valid divisor from \[2, 3, 5, 7\].
  - None of the allowed primes divide **13** exactly.
  - **Player 1** cannot make a valid move and loses.

**Result**: Player 2 wins because Player 1 cannot make a valid move.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample interaction between two players using a command-line interface.

**Starting N = 45**

```
Player 1's Turn:
Available primes: 2, 3, 5, 7
Current N: 45
Choose a prime to divide N: 5
After division, N is now 9.

Player 2's Turn:
Available primes: 2, 3, 5, 7
Current N: 9
Choose a prime to divide N: 3
After division, N is now 3.

Player 1's Turn:
Available primes: 2, 3, 5, 7
Current N: 3
Choose a prime to divide N: 3
After division, N is now 1.
Player 1 wins by reducing N to 1!
```

**Result**: Player 1 wins.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the remaining value of **N**.
- **Control the Game**: Aim to leave **N** in a state where your opponent has limited options.
- **Prime Selection**: Choose divisors that reduce **N** to a number that is not divisible by the allowed primes on your opponent's turn.

## Variations

- **Different Starting N**: Players can agree on a different starting number to vary the length and complexity of the game.
- **Allowed Primes Set**: Adjust the set of allowed primes to include more or fewer primes for increased difficulty or simplicity.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Play multiple rounds with different starting numbers and keep score of wins to determine an overall champion.
