In the gym environment for the Sequence Duel game, the action space indices correspond directly to the numbers in the sequence list. Each action index \(i\) represents the potential removal of the number \(i+1\) from the sequence. This means if a player chooses action \(i\), they are selecting and removing the number \(i+1\) from the sequence, as Python uses zero-based indexing while the sequence list is one-based.
