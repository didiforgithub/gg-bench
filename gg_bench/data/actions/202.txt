In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is discretized from 0 to 24, representing each possible move in the 5x5 grid. To map an action index to a grid position, the index is converted into a row and column by using integer division and modulo operations, respectively. Specifically, the action index divided by 5 yields the row (0 through 4) and the remainder of the action index divided by 5 gives the column (0 through 4) where the player can place their marker.
