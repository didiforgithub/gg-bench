In the Safe Code game environment, the action space is mapped as follows:

- **Action 0**: Request a clue from the opponent.
- **Actions 1-30**: Make a guess where the action index corresponds directly to the guessed integer (i.e., action 1 means guessing the number 1, action 2 means guessing the number 2, and so on up to action 30 for guessing the number 30).
