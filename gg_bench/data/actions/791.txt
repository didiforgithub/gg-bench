In the environment, the action space indices map to moves as follows:

- **Action 0**: Enter the bridge. This action is used when a player's token is off the bridge (either at position 0 for Player 1 or position 9 for Player 2), to move onto the bridge (to cell 1 for Player 1 or cell 8 for Player 2).
- **Action 1**: Move forward 1 cell. This action is used when a player's token is already on the bridge, allowing them to advance by 1 cell towards their opponent.
- **Action 2**: Move forward 2 cells. Similar to Action 1, but moves the player's token forward by 2 cells.
