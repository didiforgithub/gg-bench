In the game "Numerical Siege," the action space indices represent the following:

- **0**: Pass or "not defend" when in the defense phase.
- **1-10**: Correspond to selecting a token with the number equal to the index, whether in the attack phase (to launch an attack) or the defense phase (to defend). Each player uses tokens from their own set, and each token is only available until used in either attacking or defending.
