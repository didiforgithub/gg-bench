In the Grid Runner gym environment, the action space is represented by a discrete space with four indices, each corresponding to a directional move on the grid. The mapping is as follows:

- Action index `0` corresponds to moving **up** (decreasing the row index by 1).
- Action index `1` corresponds to moving **down** (increasing the row index by 1).
- Action index `2` corresponds to moving **left** (decreasing the column index by 1).
- Action index `3` corresponds to moving **right** (increasing the column index by 1).
