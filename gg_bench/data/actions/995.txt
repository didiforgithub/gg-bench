In the gym environment for the "Prime Total" game, the action space indices (0 to 9) map directly to the possible moves in the game, which are the numbers 1 to 10. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up until action index 9, which corresponds to selecting the number 10. This mapping allows players to choose a number from 1 to 10 as their move during each turn.
