The action space indices in the CustomEnv gym environment for "Reduction Clash" map directly to potential divisor moves in the game by considering each index as an offset from the smallest possible valid divisor. Specifically, each action space index corresponds to a divisor that is 2 plus the index value, meaning action index 0 corresponds to the divisor 2, action index 1 to the divisor 3, and so forth up to action index 97, which corresponds to divisor 99. This mapping allows for direct calculation of which divisor to use based on the chosen action index by simply adding 2 to the index value.
