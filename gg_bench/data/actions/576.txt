In the provided gym environment for Factor Frenzy, the action space indices represent potential moves (divisors that can be subtracted) in the game. The action space is defined as a discrete space with a size of `starting_N + 1`. Each index in the action space corresponds to a potential value that could be subtracted from the current target number (N). However, only the indices that match valid proper divisors (including 1 when N is prime) are allowed moves in the game. Invalid actions, those not corresponding to proper divisors, result in a loss of turn and a penalty.
