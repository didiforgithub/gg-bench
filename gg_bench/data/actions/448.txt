In the provided gym environment for the game "Token Tactics," the action space is defined by the `Discreet` space with indices ranging from 0 to MAX_TOKENS (inclusive):

- **Action 0**: Represents the "Fortify" move during the "choose_action" phase or committing 0 tokens during the "defend" phase.
- **Actions 1 to MAX_TOKENS**: Represent choosing to attack with a specified number of tokens (1 to MAX_TOKENS) or choosing to defend with the same number of tokens during their respective phases. 

Thus, each action index corresponds directly to the number of tokens committed for either attacking or defending, except index 0 which is reserved for fortifying or committing zero tokens in defense.
