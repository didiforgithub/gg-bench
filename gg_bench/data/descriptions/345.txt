# Number Warriors: Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Warriors** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where each player aims to reduce their opponent's Life Points to zero. By strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool, players engage in numerical battles to outmaneuver and outthink their opponent. The first player to deplete the opponent's Life Points wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Life Points**
   - Each player starts with **15 Life Points**.
   - Life Points are tracked throughout the game and cannot exceed the starting amount.
   
2. **Number Pool**
   - A shared pool of numbers from **1 to 9** is used.
   - These numbers represent the "Warriors" each player can deploy.
   - Once a number is used, it is removed from the pool for the remainder of the game.

3. **Game Interface**
   - The game is played in a command-line interface (CLI).
   - Players are identified as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

---

## Game Components

- **Life Points Tracker**
  - Displays each player's current Life Points.
  - Example: `Player 1 Life Points: 15`

- **Number Pool**
  - Shows which numbers are still available.
  - Example: `Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`

- **Secret Selection Mechanism**
  - Players input their chosen number without revealing it to their opponent until both have made their choices.

---

## Turns

1. **Simultaneous Selection**
   - Both players **simultaneously** select a number from the available pool.
   - Selections are made secretly to prevent the opponent from knowing the choice beforehand.
   
2. **Reveal Phase**
   - Once both players have made their selections, the chosen numbers are revealed.

3. **Resolution Phase**
   - The numbers are compared to determine damage and Life Point reduction.
   - Selected numbers are then removed from the pool.

4. **Next Turn**
   - The game proceeds to the next turn, following the same structure.
   - Turns continue until the game ends with a victory.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**
   - Players can select any **remaining number** from the pool during their turn.
   - Each number can only be used **once per game**.
   
2. **Combat Resolution**
   - After both numbers are revealed:
     - If the numbers are **different**, the player who chose the **higher number** deals damage.
     - **Damage Dealt**: The difference between the higher and lower numbers.
     - The player with the lower number **loses Life Points** equal to this difference.
     - If the numbers are **equal**, no damage is dealt; the turn ends without changes to Life Points.
   
3. **Life Points Reduction**
   - A player's Life Points are reduced based on damage taken.
   - Life Points cannot go below zero.

4. **Number Pool Depletion**
   - Used numbers are removed from the pool and cannot be selected again.
   - The pool shrinks each turn, increasing the strategic depth.

5. **Winning the Game**
   - A player wins by reducing the opponent's Life Points to **zero**.
   - If all numbers are exhausted and both players still have Life Points:
     - The player with the **higher Life Points** wins.
     - If Life Points are **equal**, the game continues with no numbers until a player's Life Points are reduced to zero (this scenario cannot occur due to the mechanics ensuring a win).

6. **No Draws**
   - The game is designed to always result in a win for one of the players.
   - Strategic choices prevent stalemates.

---

## Scoring

- **Damage Calculation**
  - `Damage = Higher Number - Lower Number`
  - Example: If Player 1 chooses 7 and Player 2 chooses 5, Damage = 7 - 5 = 2.
  
- **Life Points Tracking**
  - Players must keep track of their own and their opponent's Life Points.
  - Life Points are updated after each turn's Resolution Phase.
