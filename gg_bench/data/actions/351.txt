In the provided gym environment for Number Nimble, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 possible actions, corresponding to the numbers 1 through 9 in the game. Action indices range from 0 to 8, where each index represents a specific number by mapping index `i` to number `i + 1`. Thus, an action index of 0 means selecting the number 1, an index of 1 means selecting the number 2, and so on, up to an index of 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9. This mapping enables players to select numbers from the number pool by choosing an action index that corresponds to the desired number.
