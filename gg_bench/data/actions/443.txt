In the gym environment, the action space for the game Sum Squares is defined as a discrete space with 9 possible actions, each corresponding to selecting a number from the available pool of numbers 1 through 9. The mapping is straightforward: each action index (0 to 8) represents selecting the number (index + 1). For example, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9.
