The action space indices (0-8) in the game environment map directly to the digits 1-9. Specifically, each index corresponds to its respective digit by simply adding 1 to the index. Therefore, an action of 0 represents playing the digit 1, an action of 1 represents playing the digit 2, and so on, up to an action of 8 representing the digit 9.
