In the game environment, the action space is a discrete space where each index corresponds to one of the allowed prime divisors (2, 3, 5, 7). The mapping is as follows: index 0 maps to the divisor 2, index 1 maps to the divisor 3, index 2 maps to the divisor 5, and index 3 maps to the divisor 7. The action taken by a player on their turn is determined by selecting an index from this action space, which then uses the corresponding divisor to divide the current number in the game.
