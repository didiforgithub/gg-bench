# Game Title: **Number Quest**

## Objective

Be the first player to collect a set of numbers that meet specific mathematical criteria, demonstrating strategic selection and planning. The primary goal is to outmaneuver your opponent by selecting numbers that advance your progress while limiting their options.

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: A shared pool of numbers from **1 to 20**.
- **Win Condition**: Collect **three numbers** that satisfy a **secret criterion** chosen at the beginning of the game.
- **Starting Player**: Randomly determine who takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list of numbers from 1 to 20 available for selection.
- **Player Collections**: Each player has a personal collection where they keep their selected numbers.
- **Secret Criteria Cards**: A set of predefined mathematical criteria (e.g., even numbers, prime numbers, Fibonacci numbers).
  - Examples of criteria:
    - **Even Numbers**: Numbers divisible by 2.
    - **Odd Numbers**: Numbers not divisible by 2.
    - **Prime Numbers**: Numbers greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
    - **Multiples of 3**: Numbers divisible by 3.
    - **Perfect Squares**: Numbers that are squares of integers (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16).
    - **Fibonacci Numbers**: Numbers in the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Selection Phase**:
   - The player selects one available number from the number pool.
2. **Announcement Phase**:
   - The player announces the number chosen but not the criterion it satisfies.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The turn passes to the next player.

### Actions Per Turn

- **Select Number**: Pick a number that you believe will help fulfill your secret criterion.
- **Strategic Blocking**: Optionally select numbers that may prevent your opponent from fulfilling their criterion.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Secret Criteria Assignment

- At the start of the game, each player secretly chooses one criterion from the predefined list or draws randomly if agreed upon.
- Players keep their criteria hidden from their opponent.

### Number Selection Rules

- **Valid Choices**:
  - Players can select any number from the pool, regardless of whether it meets their own or the opponent's criterion.
- **Collection Limit**:
  - Each player's collection can have a maximum of five numbers.
- **No Reuse**:
  - Once a number is selected, it is removed from the pool and cannot be selected again.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to have **three numbers** in their collection that meet their secret criterion wins.
- **Game End**:
  - If all numbers are selected and no player meets their criterion, the player with the most qualifying numbers wins.
  - If tied, the game continues in sudden death: players take turns selecting from any remaining numbers that meet their criterion until the tie is broken.

### Strategy Elements

- **Deduction**:
  - Pay attention to the numbers your opponent selects to deduce their secret criterion.
- **Blocking**:
  - Select numbers that may be critical for your opponent's criterion to prevent them from winning.
- **Bluffing**:
  - Occasionally choose numbers that do not meet your criterion to mislead your opponent.

## Scoring

- **Winning**:
  - Achieve the game's victory condition as per the rules.
- **No Point System**:
  - The game does not track points; only victory matters.

## Examples

### Sample Gameplay

**Setup**:

- Players agree to randomly draw criteria.
- Player 1 draws **Prime Numbers**.
- Player 2 draws **Perfect Squares**.
- Criteria are kept secret.

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1** selects **7**.
  - **Announcement**: "I have selected number 7."
- **Player 2** thinks: 7 is a prime number. Possibly Player 1's criterion.

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2** selects **16**.
  - **Announcement**: "I have selected number 16."
- **Player 1** considers: 16 is a perfect square or even. Possibly Player 2's criterion.

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1** selects **5**.
  - **Announcement**: "I have selected number 5."
- **Player 2** notes: Another prime number.

**Turn 4**:

- **Player 2** selects **9**.
  - **Announcement**: "I have selected number 9."
- **Player 1** now suspects Player 2's criterion involves perfect squares.

**Turn 5**:

- **Player 1** realizes that **3** is both prime and needed to win.
- **Player 1** selects **3**.
  - **Announcement**: "I have selected number 3."
- **Player 1** now has three prime numbers: 3, 5, 7.

**Game End**:

- **Player 1** reveals their criterion: **Prime Numbers**.
- **Player 1** declares victory.

### Command-Line Interaction

**Game Start**:

- System: "Welcome to Number Quest!"
- System: "Players, your secret criteria have been assigned."

**Turn Prompts**:

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - System: "Player 1, select a number from the pool: [1-20]."
  - Player 1 Input: `7`
  - System: "Player 1 has selected number 7."
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - System: "Player 2, select a number from the pool: [1-20, excluding 7]."
  - Player 2 Input: `16`
  - System: "Player 2 has selected number 16."

**Victory Declaration**:

- After Player 1 selects their third prime number.
- System: "Player 1 has collected three numbers."
- System: "Player 1, reveal your criterion."
- Player 1: "My criterion is Prime Numbers."
- System: "Player 1 wins the game!"

## Additional Notes

- **Fair Play**:
  - Players must select numbers that actually meet their criterion when declaring victory.
  - Cheating (selecting numbers that do not meet your criterion to win) is against the rules.

- **Adapting Criteria**:
  - Players can agree to use different criteria sets or add more complex ones for increased difficulty.

- **Game Variations**:
  - **Longer Game**: Increase the number of required qualifying numbers to four or five.
  - **Open Criteria**: Players openly declare their criteria at the start for a different strategic experience.
  - **Larger Pool**: Expand the number pool for extended play or more complex strategies.

## Strategy Tips

- **Observation**:
  - Keep track of numbers your opponent selects to deduce their criterion.
- **Prioritize Key Numbers**:
  - Identify and select numbers crucial to your criterion early.
- **Diversify Selections**:
  - Occasionally pick numbers that do not meet your criterion to throw off your opponent.
- **Anticipate Moves**:
  - Predict which numbers your opponent needs and consider selecting them if they don't hinder your progress.
