# Forbidden Territory

## Objective

**Forbidden Territory** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a grid. The primary goal is to be the last player able to place a token on the board following the game's placement rules. A player loses if it's their turn and they cannot place a token according to the rules. Victory requires careful planning to limit your opponent's options while maximizing your own.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid representing the game board. Each cell in the grid can be identified by its row and column coordinates (e.g., `(1,1)` for the top-left corner).

2. **Tokens**: Each player has an unlimited supply of unique tokens (Player 1 uses `X`, and Player 2 uses `O`).

3. **Starting Player**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1). This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as flipping a coin.

4. **Initial Conditions**: All cells on the board are empty at the start of the game.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 two-dimensional board consisting of 25 cells.
- **Tokens**:
  - **Player 1 Token**: `X`
  - **Player 2 Token**: `O`
- **Forbidden Cells**: Cells that a player cannot use on their next turn because they are adjacent (including diagonally) to the opponent's last placed token.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Placement Phase**:
     - Place your token (`X` or `O`) on any empty cell that is not currently forbidden for you.
  2. **Restriction Phase**:
     - After placing your token, the cells adjacent (including diagonally) to your placed token become forbidden for your opponent's next turn.
- **Forbidden Cells Reset**: Forbidden cells apply only for one turn. After your opponent completes their turn, any cells that were forbidden to you are now available again unless they are forbidden anew by the opponent's latest move.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you must place your token on an empty cell that is not forbidden to you.
   - Forbidden cells are those adjacent to your opponent's last placed token.
   - If you have no valid moves on your turn, you lose the game.

2. **Adjacency**:
   - Adjacent cells are those directly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal from a given cell.
   - Each cell can have up to 8 adjacent cells.

3. **Forbidden Cells**:
   - After you place your token, mark all adjacent cells as forbidden for your opponent's next turn.
   - Forbidden cells are only applicable for the opponent's next turn and do not persist beyond that unless restricted again.

4. **Token Placement**:
   - Tokens remain on the board once placed and cannot be moved or removed.
   - A token occupies a cell and prevents any further placement on that cell.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - If it's a player's turn and they have no valid cells to place their token (all are either occupied or forbidden), they lose the game.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.

6. **Game End Condition**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who successfully forces their opponent into a position where they cannot place a token according to the rules wins the game.
- **Losing**: A player loses if, on their turn, they cannot place a token due to all available cells being either occupied or forbidden.

*Note*: There is no point system. The game is won by strategic placement and restriction of your opponent's moves.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sample Turns

Let's walk through a few sample turns to illustrate how the game is played.

#### Initial Board State:

All cells are empty.

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Player 1 places an `X` at cell `(3,3)`.
- **Forbidden Cells for Player 2**:
  - Cells adjacent to `(3,3)` are now forbidden:
    - `(2,2)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,4)`
    - `(3,2)`,        `(3,4)`
    - `(4,2)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,4)`
- **Board**:

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Available Cells**: Any empty cell except the forbidden cells listed above.
- **Action**: Player 2 places an `O` at cell `(1,1)`.
- **Forbidden Cells for Player 1**:
  - Cells adjacent to `(1,1)` are now forbidden:
    - `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`
- **Board**:

```
[O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Available Cells**: Any empty cell except:
  - Previously forbidden cells are now available again except where restricted anew.
  - New forbidden cells:
    - `(1,2)`, `(2,1)`, `(2,2)`
- **Action**: Player 1 places an `X` at cell `(2,4)`.
- **Forbidden Cells for Player 2**:
  - Cells adjacent to `(2,4)` are now forbidden:
    - `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`
    - `(2,3)`,        `(2,5)`
    - `(3,3)`, `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`
- **Board**:

```
[O][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][X][ ]
[ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

#### ... and so on, until a player cannot make a valid move.

### Example 2: Endgame Scenario

Assume the board is nearly full, and it's Player 2's turn.

- **Board State**:

```
[X][O][X][O][X]
[O][X][O][X][O]
[X][O][X][O][X]
[O][X][O][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

- **Forbidden Cells for Player 2**:
  - Based on Player 1's last move, certain cells are forbidden.
- **Available Moves for Player 2**:
  - Suppose only cell `(4,4)` is available.
- **Action**: Player 2 places an `O` at `(4,4)`.
- **Forbidden Cells for Player 1**:
  - Cells adjacent to `(4,4)`.
- **Board**:

```
[X][O][X][O][X]
[O][X][O][X][O]
[X][O][X][O][X]
[O][X][O][O][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
```

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - No available cells to place `X` due to forbidden cells and occupied cells.
- **Result**: Player 1 cannot make a move and loses. Player 2 wins the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Here's how the game might look in a command-line interface.

#### After Player 1's Move

```
Player 1 placed X at (3,3).
Cells forbidden for Player 2 next turn:
(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)

Current Board:
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][X][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Player 2's turn.
Available cells: [list of cells excluding forbidden and occupied]
Enter your move (row and column): 1 1
```

#### After Player 2's Move

```
Player 2 placed O at (1,1).
Cells forbidden for Player 1 next turn:
(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

Current Board:
[O][ ][ ][ ][ ]

[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Player 1's turn.

Enter your move (row and column): ...
```

#### End of Game

```
Player 1 cannot make a valid move.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Control the Center**: Placing tokens near the center can maximize the number of cells you restrict for your opponent.
- **Force Moves**: Try to force your opponent into areas of the board where their options become limited.
- **Anticipate Forbidden Cells**: Keep track of which cells will become available or forbidden to plan your moves ahead.
- **Avoid Corners**: Placing tokens in corners early may limit your own options more than your opponent's.
