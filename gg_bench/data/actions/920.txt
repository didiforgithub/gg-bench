In the game, the action space is defined such that action ID 0 corresponds to subtracting 1 from the current number \( N \). For action IDs from 1 to \( \text{starting\_N} - 2 \), each ID represents dividing \( N \) by a divisor that is one more than the action ID. This means action ID 1 corresponds to dividing \( N \) by 2, action ID 2 corresponds to dividing \( N \) by 3, and so on, up to \( N - 1 \). The mapping ensures each action ID directly connects to a possible move in the game, either subtraction or division by a valid divisor.
