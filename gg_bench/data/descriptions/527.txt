# Edge Sum

## Objective

Edge Sum is a strategic two-player turn-based game played on the command line. The primary goal of the game is to accumulate a higher total sum than your opponent by strategically selecting numbers from a shared sequence. Players take turns picking numbers from either end of a sequence of integers. The player with the highest total sum at the end of the game wins.

## Setup

1. **Game Sequence Initialization**:
   - A sequence of positive integers is generated and presented to both players. For simplicity, the sequence contains an even number of elements, typically between 6 to 10 numbers. Example: `[3, 9, 1, 2, 7, 5]`.

2. **Player Assignment**:
   - Two players are identified as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Player 1 makes the first move.

3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Both players begin with a total sum of zero.
   - The game sequence is displayed to both players at the start of the game.

## Game Components

- **Game Sequence**: An ordered list of integers displayed horizontally. Example: `[3, 9, 1, 2, 7, 5]`.
- **Players**: Two participants alternating turns, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Player Totals**: Each player maintains a running total sum of the numbers they have selected.
- **Turn Indicator**: Displays which player's turn it is.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players interact with the game by inputting commands in the terminal.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - At the start of each turn, the current state of the game sequence is displayed.
   - The player whose turn it is chooses a number from **either the leftmost or rightmost end** of the sequence.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:
   - **View Game Sequence**: Players see the current sequence of numbers.
   - **Select a Number**: Players input their choice to pick the leftmost or rightmost number.
   - **Update Totals**: The selected number is added to the player's total sum.
   - **Sequence Update**: The chosen number is removed from the sequence.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
   - The game continues until all numbers in the sequence have been selected.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On their turn, a player must choose **either** the leftmost **or** the rightmost number in the sequence.
   - Only the end numbers are available for selection; players cannot select numbers from the middle.

2. **Adding to Total Sum**:
   - Once a number is selected, it is immediately added to the player's total sum.
   - The selected number is removed from the game sequence.

3. **Game Sequence Management**:
   - After each turn, the sequence shrinks as numbers are removed from the ends.
   - The updated sequence is displayed at the start of each new turn.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends when all numbers have been selected.
   - The player with the **higher total sum** wins the game.
   - There is **no draw**; if the total sums are equal, the game can declare a tiebreaker based on predefined criteria (e.g., the last player to pick wins or loses), or adjust the initial conditions to prevent ties.

5. **Strategic Depth**:
   - Players must anticipate future moves and plan accordingly.
   - Understanding which numbers remain and predicting the opponent's choices are key to winning.

## Scoring

- **Player Totals**:
  - Each player maintains a running total of the numbers they have selected.
  - The totals are updated and displayed after each turn.

- **Determining the Winner**:
  - After the final turn, compare the total sums of both players.
  - The player with the **higher total sum** is declared the winner.

- **No Draw Mechanism**:
  - The game is designed to avoid ties. If the sums are equal, the game rules determine a clear winner based on a tiebreaker (such as the last player to make a move).
