In the gym environment for **Modular Countdown**, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(K)`, representing integers from `0` to `K-1`. Each action index corresponds to adding a number from `1` to `K` to the counter. Specifically, action index `i` maps to adding the number `i + 1` to the counter. This means if a player selects action `0`, they add `1` to the counter; action `1` adds `2`, and so on, up to action `K-1`, which adds `K`.
