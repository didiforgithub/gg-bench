# **Resource War**: Rule Book

## **Objective**

*Resource War* is a strategic bidding game for two players. The primary goal is to be the first player to accumulate **7 or more Resource Points**. Players achieve victory by outbidding their opponent in a series of rounds while managing their limited Bidding Points effectively. The game ends immediately when a player reaches the required Resource Points or when both players have exhausted their Bidding Points.

## **Setup**

1. **Bidding Points**: Each player starts with **10 Bidding Points**. These points are used to bid against the opponent in each round.
2. **Resource Points**: Both players begin with **0 Resource Points**. The first to reach **7 Resource Points** wins the game.

- **Bidding Points Counter**: Tracks each player's remaining Bidding Points (starts at 10 for each player).
- **Resource Points Counter**: Tracks each player's accumulated Resource Points (starts at 0 for each player).
- **Rounds Counter** (optional): Keeps track of the number of rounds played.

1. **Bidding Phase**:
   - Both players **simultaneously** decide how many Bidding Points to wager for the round. The bid must be a whole number between **0** and the player's **remaining Bidding Points**.
   - Bids are kept **secret** until both players are ready to reveal.

2. **Reveal Phase**:
   - Both players **simultaneously reveal** their bids.
