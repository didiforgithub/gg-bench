In the CustomEnv gym environment for the Parity Duel game, the action space is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 19, corresponding to the number pool from 1 to 20. Each index represents a move where selecting index `i` translates to selecting the number `i + 1` from the pool. For example, choosing action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on up to action index 19, which corresponds to selecting the number 20.
