- **Actions per Turn:**
  - **Select a Digit:** Choose one available digit from the pool.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Digit Selection:**
   - On your turn, you may select **any one** available digit from **1** to **9**.
   - Once selected, the digit is no longer available for either player.
2. **Restriction Based on Opponent's Choices:**
   - **You cannot select a digit that, when added to any digit previously selected by your opponent, sums to **10****.
     - *Example:* If your opponent has selected **3**, you cannot select **7** (since **3 + 7 = 10**).
   - This rule applies to **all digits** your opponent has selected throughout the game.
3. **Objective Achievement:**
   - **Winning Condition:** Force your opponent to be the player who must select the **last remaining digit**.
   - **Losing Condition:** Being compelled to select the final digit due to no other options.

### **Scoring**

- **Win:** Successfully maneuver your selections so that your opponent is forced to pick the last digit.
- **Loss:** Being the player who must select the last remaining digit.
- There are no points; the game outcome is a win or loss based on the final move.
