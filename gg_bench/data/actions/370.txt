In the given gym environment for the "Cross Over" game, the action space consists of two discrete indices: 0 and 1. These indices map to the possible moves as follows:

- Action 0 corresponds to moving the player's token forward by 1 position.
- Action 1 corresponds to moving the player's token forward by 2 positions.

Thus, each index in the action space directly translates to the distance the current player's token will move forward on their turn.
