# Reverse Digit Duel

## Objective

Reverse Digit Duel is a two-player, turn-based game where each player aims to construct the lowest possible three-digit number. Players take turns selecting digits from 1 to 9, assigning each chosen digit to a position (hundreds, tens, or ones place) in their own number. Once both players have completed their three-digit numbers, the player with the **lowest** number wins the game.

## Setup

- **Digit Pool**: A shared pool of digits from **1** to **9**.
- **Player Boards**: Each player has a personal board with three slots representing the hundreds, tens, and ones places of a three-digit number.
- **Starting Conditions**: No digits are assigned at the beginning. All digits from 1 to 9 are available in the digit pool.

## Game Components

- **Digits (1-9)**: Represented as numbers in the command-line interface. Each digit can be selected only once per game.
- **Player Boards**: Visualized in the CLI as placeholders for the hundreds, tens, and ones positions for each player.

Example:

```
Player 1 Board: [_] [_] [_]
Player 2 Board: [_] [_] [_]
Available Digits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss, agreement, or random selection).
- **Structure of a Turn**:
  1. **Select a Digit**: The current player chooses an available digit from the digit pool.
  2. **Assign the Digit**: The player assigns the chosen digit to one of the three positions (hundreds, tens, or ones) on their board. Once placed, the digit cannot be moved.
  3. **Update Boards**: The game displays the updated boards and the remaining available digits.
- **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until all digits in their three-digit numbers are assigned.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - Each digit from **1** to **9** can be selected only once during the game.
   - Players must choose from the remaining available digits in the pool.
   
2. **Digit Assignment**:
   - On their turn, after selecting a digit, players must immediately assign it to one of the open positions (hundreds, tens, or ones) on their board.
   - Once a digit is assigned to a position, it **cannot be changed** later in the game.
   
3. **Objective**:
   - The goal is to create the **lowest possible three-digit number**.
   - Strategic placement is key, as players must anticipate which digits may be available in future turns.

4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends after both players have filled all three positions on their boards.
   - The player with the lower three-digit number wins.
   
5. **Winning the Game**:
   - If both players create identical numbers, which is highly unlikely due to the unique digit selection, the game results in a win for the player who completed their number **second**, emphasizing the strategic advantage of turn order.
   
6. **No Draws**:
   - The game is designed to avoid draws, ensuring a decisive outcome each time.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: Having a lower three-digit number than the opponent.
- **No Points System**: The game uses a win/loss outcome without cumulative scoring.
- **Match Play**:
  - Players may choose to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of wins to determine an overall champion after a set number of games.
