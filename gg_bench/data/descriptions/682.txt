# Digit Dilemma: Rule Book

## Objective

**Digit Dilemma** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to construct a three-digit number that is a multiple of **7** by strategically selecting and placing digits from a shared pool. Players must carefully choose digits and their positions to form a valid number while also anticipating and blocking their opponent's potential moves. Victory is achieved by completing a qualifying number first, ensuring a definitive win with no possibility of a draw.

---

## Setup

1. **Digit Pool Initialization:**
   - Create a shared pool containing the digits **0** through **9**.
   - Each digit is unique within the pool and can be selected only once during the game.

2. **Player Boards:**
   - Each player has an individual board or placeholder for constructing their three-digit number.
   - The number positions are labeled as:
     - **Left** (Hundreds place)
     - **Middle** (Tens place)
     - **Right** (Units place)
   - All positions start empty, represented as underscores: `_ _ _`

3. **Starting the Game:**
   - Determine the first player through any mutual agreement or random selection.
   - The game proceeds in alternating turns between Player 1 and Player 2.

## Game Components

1. **Shared Digit Pool:**
   - Digits: **0**, **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, **6**, **7**, **8**, **9**
   - Functionality: Players select digits from this pool to build their numbers.
   - Unique Attribute: Once a digit is selected by either player, it is removed from the pool and cannot be selected again.

2. **Player Boards:**
   - Visual Representation: `_ _ _` for empty positions.
   - Positions:
     - **Left**: Represents the hundreds place.
     - **Middle**: Represents the tens place.
     - **Right**: Represents the units place.
   - Functionality: Players assign selected digits to these positions to form their three-digit numbers.

3. **Command-Line Interface:**
   - Inputs: Players enter their chosen digit and position during their turn.
   - Outputs: The game displays the current state of the digit pool, player boards, and validation messages.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
   - Each turn consists of two main actions:
     1. **Digit Selection**
     2. **Digit Placement**

2. **Player Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Digit Selection:**
     - Choose any available digit from the shared digit pool.
   - **Digit Placement:**
     - Assign the selected digit to any one empty position on your player board: Left, Middle, or Right.
     - **Note:** Once a digit is placed in a position, it **cannot** be moved or changed.

3. **Progression of Turns:**
   - After a player completes their turn, the selected digit is removed from the digit pool.
   - The game updates the display to show the current state before the next player's turn begins.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Digit Availability:**
   - Each digit (0-9) is available only once.
   - Digits already selected and placed by either player are no longer available.

2. **Digit Placement Restrictions:**
   - Players must assign a digit to an **empty position** on their own board.
   - Positions cannot be left unassigned once a digit is placed.

3. **Number Formation:**
   - Players aim to construct a three-digit number.
   - The Left position is the hundreds place, Middle is the tens place, and Right is the units place.

4. **Immutability of Placement:**
   - Once a digit is placed in a position, it is fixed for the remainder of the game.
   - Strategic foresight is essential to avoid being stuck with an invalid number.

### Winning the Game

1. **Victory Condition:**
   - The first player to complete their three-digit number that is **exactly divisible by 7** wins the game.

2. **Completion and Verification:**
   - Upon completing their number, a player must declare their number.
   - The game verifies if the number is divisible by 7.

3. **Tie-Breaker Rules:**
   - If both players complete their numbers and neither is divisible by 7:
     - The player whose number is **closer to the next higher multiple of 7** wins.
     - If both numbers are equally distant, the player with the **smaller number** wins.

4. **Exhaustion of Digits:**
   - If all digits are used and no player has formed a number divisible by 7, apply the tie-breaker rules to determine the winner.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome:**
  - The game focuses on a definitive win or loss.
  - There is no point-based scoring system.
- **Recording Results:**
  - Players may keep track of wins in a match series if desired.
  - Skill improvement is measured by the ability to consistently construct valid numbers and win rounds.
