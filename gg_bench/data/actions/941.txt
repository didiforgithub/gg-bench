The action space indices correspond directly to the indices of the `self.numbers` array, which contains integers ranging from 2 to 50. When a player takes a turn, they select an action representing the index of the number they wish to choose from the `self.numbers` array. For example, if a player selects action 0, it indicates choosing the number at index 0 of `self.numbers`, which is the number 2. This indexing system allows for straightforward correspondence between action space indices and the actual numbers available in the game.
