# **Grid Lock**

## **Objective**

Be the last player able to make a valid move on the grid by strategically claiming cells and blocking your opponent's options. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn; the other player is declared the winner.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Grid Initialization**:
   - The game is played on a 4x4 grid consisting of 16 cells.
   - Cells are numbered from **1** to **16**, arranged sequentially from left to right, top to bottom.

     ```
     1   2   3   4
     5   6   7   8
     9  10  11  12
     13 14  15  16
     ```

2. **Starting Conditions**:
   - All cells are initially unclaimed and unblocked.
   - Players decide who takes the first turn (Player 1 and Player 2).

---

## **Game Components**

1. **The Grid**:
   - A 4x4 grid with cells numbered **1** to **16**.
   - Cells can be in one of three states:
     - **Unclaimed**: Available for players to claim.
     - **Claimed**: Occupied by a player and marked with their symbol ('X' for Player 1, 'O' for Player 2).
     - **Blocked**: Unavailable for claiming, marked with a '-' symbol.

2. **Players**:
   - **Player 1**: Uses the symbol 'X'.
   - **Player 2**: Uses the symbol 'O'.

3. **Markers**:
   - **'X'**: Indicates a cell claimed by Player 1.
   - **'O'**: Indicates a cell claimed by Player 2.
   - **'-'**: Indicates a blocked cell.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - **Claiming a Cell**:
     - On their turn, a player selects an unclaimed and unblocked cell by entering its number.
     - The selected cell is marked with the player's symbol on the grid.
     - All adjacent cells become blocked.

3. **Adjacency**:
   - Adjacent cells include all cells horizontally, vertically, and diagonally surrounding the claimed cell.

4. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a player completes their move, the turn passes to the other player.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Claiming Cells**:
   - Players can only claim cells that are unclaimed and unblocked.
   - Once a cell is claimed, it remains occupied by that player for the rest of the game.

2. **Blocking Cells**:
   - When a cell is claimed, all adjacent cells become blocked.
   - Blocked cells are marked with a '-' and cannot be claimed by either player.
   - Blocking occurs immediately after a cell is claimed.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - A valid move consists of selecting an unclaimed, unblocked cell.
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn, they lose the game.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The last player able to make a valid move wins.
   - If a player cannot make a move on their turn, the other player wins.

## **Scoring**

- There is no point-based scoring system.
- Victory is determined by being the last player able to make a valid move.

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Consider the impact of your move on future options.
  - Aim to maximize your accessible cells while minimizing your opponent's choices.

- **Control the Center**:

- **Force Your Opponent's Moves**:
  - Guide your opponent into areas of the grid with fewer options.
