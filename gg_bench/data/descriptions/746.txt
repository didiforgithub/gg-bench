# Rule Book for "Number Tower"

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly** the **Target Height** by strategically adding Number Blocks to the Tower without exceeding it.

---

## Setup

1. **Target Height**: Agree on a Target Height for the Tower (e.g., **20** for a quick game).
2. **Number Blocks**: Each player has a set of Number Blocks numbered **1** to **9**.
3. **Tower**: The Tower starts at a height of **0**.

## Game Components

### Number Blocks

- **Description**: Individual blocks numbered **1** through **9**.
- **Appearance**: Represented by their numerical value (e.g., `1`, `2`, ..., `9`).
- **Functionality**: 
  - Each block increases the Tower's height by its number when added.
  - Once used, a Number Block is removed from the player's set and cannot be reused.
  
### Tower

- **Description**: A shared structure representing the cumulative height.
- **Starting Height**: **0**.
- **Functionality**: 
  - The current height increases as players add Number Blocks.
  - The Tower's height cannot exceed the Target Height.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement). Turns alternate between players.
2. **During a Turn**:
   - **Select a Number Block**: Choose one available Number Block from your set.
   - **Add to Tower**: Increase the Tower's height by the value of the chosen Number Block.
   - **Remove Number Block**: Remove the used Number Block from your set.
3. **Valid Moves**:
   - You must choose a Number Block that does not cause the Tower to exceed the Target Height.
   - If no such Number Block is available on your turn, you lose the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Adding Number Blocks**:
   - On your turn, you **must** add one Number Block to the Tower.
   - The block's value is added to the current Tower height.
   
2. **Target Height Limit**:
   - The Tower's height **cannot exceed** the Target Height.
   - If adding any of your remaining Number Blocks would exceed the Target Height, you lose.
   
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who brings the Tower's height to **exactly** the Target Height wins immediately.
   
4. **Number Block Availability**:
   - Each player tracks their own set of Number Blocks.
   - Used blocks are removed from the game and cannot be reused.
   
5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Anticipate the consequences of your move on the opponent's options.
   - Aim to avoid setting up the opponent for a winning move.

## Scoring

- **Single Game Victory**: The player who wins the game by reaching the Target Height scores **1 point**.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:

## Examples

### Example Game

**Setup**:

- **Target Height**: **20**
- **Players**: Alice (Player A) and Bob (Player B)
- **Initial Tower Height**: **0**
- **Number Blocks Available**:
  - **Alice**: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`
  - **Bob**: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`

**Gameplay**:

1. **Turn 1**: Alice's Turn
   - Chooses Number Block **`5`**.
   - Tower Height: `0 + 5 = 5`.
   - Alice's Remaining Blocks: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

2. **Turn 2**: Bob's Turn
   - Chooses Number Block **`4`**.
   - Tower Height: `5 + 4 = 9`.
   - Bob's Remaining Blocks: `1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

3. **Turn 3**: Alice's Turn
   - Chooses Number Block **`6`**.
   - Tower Height: `9 + 6 = 15`.
   - Alice's Remaining Blocks: `1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9`.

4. **Turn 4**: Bob's Turn
   - Chooses Number Block **`5`**.
   - Tower Height: `15 + 5 = 20`.
   - Bob's Remaining Blocks: `1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9`.

**Result**: Bob reaches the Target Height of **20** and **wins** the game.

**Analysis**:

- Alice's move to add `6` brought the Tower Height to `15`, allowing Bob the opportunity to win by adding his `5`.
- Alice could have avoided this by adding a smaller Number Block.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
[Game Start] Target Height: 20. Tower Height: 0.

Player A's turn.
Your Number Blocks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Enter Number Block to add: 5
You added 5 to the Tower.
Tower Height is now 5.

Player B's turn.
Your Number Blocks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Enter Number Block to add: 4
You added 4 to the Tower.
Tower Height is now 9.

Player A's turn.
Your Number Blocks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Enter Number Block to add: 6
You added 6 to the Tower.
Tower Height is now 15.

Player B's turn.
Your Number Blocks: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Enter Number Block to add: 5
You added 5 to the Tower.
Tower Height is now 20.

Player B has reached the Target Height. Player B wins!
```

## Strategies

- **Plan Ahead**: Think about the cumulative total and how your Number Block choice will affect the next turn.
- **Avoid Setting Up the Opponent**: Don't raise the Tower Height to a number that allows the opponent to reach the Target Height on their next turn.
- **Use Lower Number Blocks Early**: Preserve higher Number Blocks to control the endgame.
- **Track Opponent's Blocks**: Keep note of which Number Blocks the opponent has used to anticipate their potential moves.

---

## Variations

- **Different Target Heights**: Adjust the Target Height to change the game's length and complexity.
- **Limited Number Blocks**: Use a subset of Number Blocks (e.g., only `1` to `5`) for a shorter game.
- **Hidden Blocks**: Keep your remaining Number Blocks secret to increase unpredictability.
