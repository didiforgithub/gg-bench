**Palindrome Duel**

---

**Objective**

Palindrome Duel is a two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to create a palindrome within a shared word space. A palindrome is a sequence of letters that reads the same forwards and backwards. The primary goal is to strategically place letters to form a palindrome of at least three letters in length. The first player to create such a palindrome wins the game.

**Setup**

- A shared word space consisting of **seven** empty positions, represented as underscores (`_`), is presented to both players.
- The positions are numbered from **1** to **7** for reference.
- Both players have access to the letters **A** to **Z** for placement.

Initial Word Space:

```
Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
           _ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

**Game Components**

- **Shared Word Space**: A linear sequence of seven positions where letters will be placed.
- **Letters**: Each player can use any letter from **A** to **Z** during their turn.
- **Positions**: Each position in the word space is identified by a number from 1 to 7.

**Turns**

- Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).
- Players take turns alternately.
- On each turn, a player performs the following actions:
  - **Select** an empty position (1-7) in the word space.
  - **Place** a letter (A-Z) into the chosen position.

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Letter Placement**
   - Players can place any letter from A to Z.
   - Once a letter is placed, it cannot be moved or changed.
   - Each position can only hold one letter.

2. **Creating a Palindrome**
   - A palindrome must be at least **three letters** long.
   - The palindrome can start and end at any positions within the word space.
   - The palindrome can be formed using letters placed by **both players**.
   - The player who places the final letter that completes a palindrome of at least three letters wins the game.

3. **Winning the Game**
   - The game is won immediately when a player completes a palindrome on their turn.
   - If the entire word space is filled without a palindrome being formed, the **last player who made a move loses**.

4. **Preventing Opponent's Victory**
   - Players should be cautious not to set up their opponent to win on the next turn.
   - Strategic letter placement can block potential palindromic sequences.

**Scoring**

- **Winning**: The player who successfully creates a palindrome of at least three letters wins the game.
- **Losing**: If the word space is completely filled without a palindrome, the last player to place a letter loses.

**Examples**

Below are example scenarios to illustrate how the game is played in a command-line interface.

**Example Game Play**

Initial Word Space:

```
Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
           _ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

*Player 1 and Player 2 decide that Player 1 will start.*

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Place letter **'R'** at position **4**.
- **Command**: `place R 4`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             _ _ _ R _ _ _
  ```

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Place letter **'A'** at position **3**.
- **Command**: `place A 3`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             _ _ A R _ _ _
  ```

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Place letter **'C'** at position **5**.
- **Command**: `place C 5`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             _ _ A R C _ _
  ```

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action**: Place letter **'E'** at position **2**.
- **Command**: `place E 2`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             _ E A R C _ _
  ```

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Action**: Place letter **'C'** at position **6**.
- **Command**: `place C 6`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             _ E A R C C _
  ```

**Turn 6: Player 2**

- **Action**: Place letter **'A'** at position **1**.
- **Command**: `place A 1`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             A E A R C C _
  ```

**Turn 7: Player 1**

- **Action**: Place letter **'R'** at position **7**.
- **Command**: `place R 7`
- **Resulting Word Space**:

  ```
  Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
             A E A R C C R
  ```

---

**Analyzing for Palindromes:**

- Player 1 just placed **'R'** at position **7**.
- Let's look for palindromic sequences of at least three letters.

Checking positions 5-7:
- Letters: C C R
- Sequence: Not a palindrome.

Checking positions 4-7:
- Letters: R C C R
- Sequence: **R C C R** is a palindrome.
- **Player 1 forms the palindrome 'RCCR' and wins the game.**

---

**Conclusion**

- **Player 1** wins by creating the palindrome **'RCCR'**.

**Command-Line Interaction Example**

```
Player 1's turn.
Current word space: _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Enter your move (e.g., place A 4): place R 4

Player 2's turn.
Current word space: _ _ _ R _ _ _
Enter your move: place A 3

Player 1's turn.
Current word space: _ _ A R _ _ _
Enter your move: place C 5

Player 2's turn.
Current word space: _ _ A R C _ _
Enter your move: place E 2

Player 1's turn.
Current word space: _ E A R C _ _
Enter your move: place C 6

Player 2's turn.
Current word space: _ E A R C C _
Enter your move: place A 1

Player 1's turn.
Current word space: A E A R C C _
Enter your move: place R 7

Player 1 creates a palindrome 'RCCR' and wins the game!
```

**Strategic Notes**

- **Plan Ahead**: Try to anticipate your opponent's moves and prevent them from completing a palindrome.
- **Block Opponent**: Place letters in positions that could disrupt potential palindromic sequences your opponent might be forming.
- **Use Symmetry**: Leveraging symmetrical placement can help you set up your own palindromes.
- **Be Cautious**: Avoid setting up a sequence that your opponent could easily complete to form a palindrome on their turn.

**Summary**

Palindrome Duel is a simple yet strategic game that requires players to think ahead and carefully choose their letter placements. With easy-to-understand rules and quick gameplay, it provides an engaging experience that can be easily implemented in a command-line interface.
