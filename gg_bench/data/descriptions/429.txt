**Pattern Builder**

---

**Objective:**

Become the first player to create a specific pattern within a shared sequence of symbols. The target pattern is predefined, and the game revolves around strategic placement to achieve this pattern while preventing your opponent from doing so.

**Setup:**

- The game starts with an empty sequence.
- Two symbols are used in the game: 'A' and 'B'.

**Game Components:**

- **Symbols:**
  - 'A' and 'B' are the only symbols used.
  - Players choose which symbol to add on their turn.
- **Shared Sequence:**
  - A sequence that both players contribute to by adding symbols.
  - Starts empty and grows as the game progresses.
- **Target Pattern:**
  - A predefined pattern that players aim to create within the shared sequence.
  - For this game, the target pattern is `'ABBA'`.

**Turns:**

- Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss, mutual agreement).
- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **On each turn:**
  - The player appends either 'A' or 'B' to the end of the shared sequence.
  - Only one symbol can be added per turn.
- The game continues until one player creates the target pattern within the shared sequence.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Adding Symbols:**
   - On their turn, a player must choose to add either 'A' or 'B' to the shared sequence.
   - The symbol is appended to the end of the sequence; symbols already in the sequence cannot be altered.
   
2. **Creating the Target Pattern:**
   - The goal is to be the first to form the target pattern `'ABBA'` within the shared sequence.
   - The pattern can occur anywhere in the sequence but must be in consecutive order.
   - Overlapping patterns are allowed (e.g., the end of one pattern may serve as the beginning of another).

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The player who adds a symbol that completes the target pattern wins immediately.
   - If the target pattern is formed as a result of a player's turn, that player wins.

4. **Game Continuation:**
   - If the sequence grows long without forming the target pattern, the game continues indefinitely until the pattern is created.
   - There are no limits to the length of the sequence.

5. **No Draws:**
   - The game continues until the target pattern is formed, ensuring a clear winner.
   - Due to the nature of the game, a draw is impossible.

**Scoring:**

- **Winning:**
  - The winner is the player who successfully completes the target pattern `'ABBA'`.
  - No points are assigned; the win is based on achieving the objective.
- **Tracking Progress:**
  - Players can keep track of the sequence and strategize based on the current state.
  - Skilled players will plan ahead to force the opponent into creating opportunities for the target pattern.

**Examples:**

*Example Game Play:*

1. **Initial State:**
   - Shared Sequence: (empty)

2. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses to add 'A'.
   - Shared Sequence: **A**

3. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses to add 'B'.
   - Shared Sequence: **AB**

4. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses to add 'B'.
   - Shared Sequence: **ABB**

5. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses to add 'A'.
   - Shared Sequence: **ABBA**
   - The target pattern `'ABBA'` is formed.
   - **Player 2 wins the game.**

*Command-Line Interaction Sample:*

```
Shared Sequence: 
Player 1's Turn. Choose a symbol to add ('A' or 'B'): A
Shared Sequence: A
Player 2's Turn. Choose a symbol to add ('A' or 'B'): B
Shared Sequence: AB
Player 1's Turn. Choose a symbol to add ('A' or 'B'): B
Shared Sequence: ABB
Player 2's Turn. Choose a symbol to add ('A' or 'B'): A
Shared Sequence: ABBA
Player 2 has formed the pattern 'ABBA' and wins the game!
```

**Strategic Depth:**

- **Anticipation:**
  - Players must anticipate their opponent's moves to block them from forming the target pattern.
  
- **Forcing Moves:**
  - Skilled players can force their opponent into positions where any move they make may lead to the skilled player forming the pattern on their next turn.

- **Pattern Recognition:**
  - Keeping track of the evolving sequence to identify potential opportunities or threats related to the target pattern.

**Conclusion:**

Pattern Builder is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and manipulate the shared sequence to their advantage. With only two symbols and a clear objective, the game is easy to learn and quick to play, making it ideal for a command-line interface. The possibility of deep strategic play ensures that skilled players can consistently outperform less experienced opponents, fulfilling the game's design goals.
