In the game, the action space indices from 0 to 63 map directly to the 8x8 grid cells, representing possible moves. The indices correspond to grid coordinates in row-major order. Specifically, index 0 maps to `A1`, index 1 maps to `A2`, ..., up to index 7 which maps to `A8`. Index 8 starts a new row, mapping to `B1`, index 9 maps to `B2`, and so forth, continuing this pattern until index 63 maps to `H8`. Thus, when a player selects an action, the index directly determines the grid cell they are guessing.
