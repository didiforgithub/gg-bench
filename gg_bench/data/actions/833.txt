In the game environment, the action space consists of 20 discrete indices. These indices map to the allowed moves, which are integers from -10 to -1 and 1 to 10, excluding 0. Specifically:

- Action indices 0 through 9 map to moves -10 through -1, respectively. This is done by taking the action index and subtracting 10.
- Action indices 10 through 19 map to moves 1 through 10, respectively. This is achieved by subtracting 9 from the action index.

This mapping effectively covers the entire range of valid moves in the game without including the forbidden value of 0.
