In the gym environment for the game Factor Frenzy, the action space is defined as Discrete(3), representing the three allowed factors a player can choose on their turn. The mapping is as follows:
- Action index 0 corresponds to choosing factor 2.
- Action index 1 corresponds to choosing factor 3.
- Action index 2 corresponds to choosing factor 5.

These indices allow players to select one of the three factors (2, 3, or 5) to multiply with the current number during their turn, influencing the game's progression.
