The action space in the game maps each action index to a combination of selecting a digit and placing it in a slot. The indices range from 0 to 53, representing 54 possible actions: selecting one of 9 digits (1-9) and placing it in one of 6 slots (3 slots per player). The mapping is as follows:

- Each action index is divided by 6 to determine the digit (action_digit = index // 6 + 1).
- The remainder of the action index when divided by 6 gives the slot (action_slot = index % 6). 

This allows any combination of a digit being placed into a slot to be captured by a unique action index.
