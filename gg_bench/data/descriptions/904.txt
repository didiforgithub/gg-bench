# Isolation

## Objective

Be the player to remove the last available number from a linear sequence by strategically isolating your opponent's options. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn, thereby securing your victory.

## Setup

- **Game Sequence**: A line of consecutive numbers from **1** to **11**, arranged in ascending order.
  
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
  ```

- **Player Assignment**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by a coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Number Line**: A simple linear sequence of numbers from **1** to **11**.
  
- **Markers**: In a command-line interface, numbers can be displayed as available or removed. Removed numbers and isolated numbers can be indicated by brackets or symbols.

  - **Available Number**: Display the number as-is (e.g., `5`).
  - **Removed Number**: Indicate with parentheses (e.g., `(5)`).
  - **Isolated Number**: Indicate with square brackets (e.g., `[5]`).

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
  
- **Turn Actions**: During your turn, perform the following steps:

  1. **Select a Number**: Choose one available number from the sequence to remove.
  2. **Update the Sequence**: Mark the chosen number as removed and update adjacent numbers as isolated.
  3. **Display**: Show the updated sequence to your opponent.

- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until no valid moves remain.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Removing Numbers**:

   - On your turn, you must remove **one** available number from the sequence.
   - To remove a number, it must not be isolated or already removed.

2. **Isolation Mechanic**:

   - When a number is removed, its immediate neighbors (numbers directly adjacent to it in the sequence) become **isolated**.
   - Isolated numbers cannot be removed on subsequent turns.
   - If an adjacent number is already removed or isolated, it remains in its current state.

3. **Valid Moves**:

   - A valid move consists of removing an available (non-isolated, non-removed) number.
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn, they lose the game.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - The player who removes the last available number wins.
   - If a player cannot make a move on their turn (no available numbers remain), they lose.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: Winning a single game constitutes a win.
  
- **Match Play (Optional)**:

  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of games won by each player.
  - The player with the most victories after an agreed number of rounds is the overall winner.

## Strategy Tips

- **Central Control**: Removing central numbers early (like 6) isolates multiple numbers and limits your opponent's options.
- **Isolation**: Aim to create clusters of isolated numbers around the numbers your opponent might choose.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into positions where their choices are limited to ensure your path to victory.
