The action space in the CustomEnv gym environment is represented by a discrete space with two possible actions: 0 and 1. These correspond to the binary digits '0' and '1', which players can append to their binary string during each turn. Index 0 in the action space maps to the move of appending '0', and index 1 maps to the move of appending '1'.
