In the action space of the gym environment, actions are represented as indices from 0 to 7. These indices correspond to the multipliers a player can choose during their turn, where:

- Action index 0 maps to multiplier 2.
- Action index 1 maps to multiplier 3.
- Action index 2 maps to multiplier 4.
- Action index 3 maps to multiplier 5.
- Action index 4 maps to multiplier 6.
- Action index 5 maps to multiplier 7.
- Action index 6 maps to multiplier 8.
- Action index 7 maps to multiplier 9.

In this way, each index is offset by 2 to obtain the multiplier used in the game.
