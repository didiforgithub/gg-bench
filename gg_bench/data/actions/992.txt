The action space indices correspond directly to the positions within the list of available numbers from 2 to 30. Each index from 0 to 28 in the action space represents selecting the number at the same position within this list. For example, an action of 0 selects the number 2, an action of 1 selects the number 3, and so on, up to an action of 28 which selects the number 30. This mapping allows players to choose numbers by specifying their index in the predefined list of numbers.
