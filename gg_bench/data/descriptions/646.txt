# Digit Dilemma

## Objective

**Be the player with the higher numerical value of your constructed number at the end of the game.** Players take turns selecting digits from a shared sequence to build their own numbers. Strategic selection is key to outmaneuvering your opponent and achieving victory.

## Setup

- **Shared Digit Sequence**: A sequence of 20 random digits (0-9) is generated and displayed to both players. The digits are arranged in a line and are accessible from either end.
  
  Example:
  ```
  Shared Sequence: 4 7 1 9 3 2 8 5 0 6 2 3 7 4 8 1 5 9 0 6
  ```

- **Player Numbers**: Each player starts with an empty number (no digits).

- **Player Roles**: Decide which player goes first. You can flip a coin, have the system choose at random, or agree between players.

## Game Components

- **Shared Sequence**: A mutable list of digits accessible from both ends.
  
- **Player Numbers**: Each player's number is a string or array of digits that they build during the game.

- **Turns Tracker**: Keeps track of whose turn it is.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  
  1. **Display Current State**:
     - Current shared sequence of digits.
     - Each player's current number.
  
  2. **Player Action**:
     - The active player chooses **one digit** from **either the start or the end** of the shared sequence.
     - The chosen digit is appended to the **right end** of their own number.
  
  3. **Update Sequence**:
     - Remove the chosen digit from the shared sequence.
  
  4. **Switch Turns**:
     - The other player becomes the active player.

- **Example Turn**:
  
  - **Shared Sequence**: `4 7 1 9 3 2 8 5 0 6 2 3 7 4 8 1 5 9 0 6`
  - **Player 1's Number**: (empty)
  - **Player 2's Number**: (empty)
  
  **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses `4` from the start.
  - **Player 1's Number**: `4`
  - **Updated Sequence**: `7 1 9 3 2 8 5 0 6 2 3 7 4 8 1 5 9 0 6`

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - On your turn, you **must** select one digit.
   - You may only choose from the **start or the end** of the shared sequence.
   - You **cannot** skip your turn or pass.

2. **Building Your Number**:
   - Append the chosen digit to the **right end** of your current number.
   - The number builds from left to right based on your selections.

3. **Sequence Depletion**:
   - The game ends when all digits have been selected and the shared sequence is empty.

4. **No Skipping Digits**:
   - You cannot select digits from the middle of the sequence.
   - Only the **first** (leftmost) or **last** (rightmost) digit is available on your turn.

5. **No Draws**:
   - If both players end up with numbers of equal value, the **second player** (the one who did not start first) is declared the winner. This rule ensures that there are no ties.

## Scoring

- **Number Evaluation**:
  - At the game's end, each player's number is considered as a whole integer.
  - Example: If your selected digits were `4`, `9`, `2`, your number is `492`.

- **Determining the Winner**:
  - The player with the **higher numerical value** wins the game.
  - If both numbers are equal, the **second player wins**, as per the no-draw rule.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Initial Shared Sequence**:

```
Shared Sequence: 3 6 1 9 4 7 2 5 8 0
```

**Player 1's Number**: (empty)

**Player 2's Number**: (empty)

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses `3` from the start.
   - **Player 1's Number**: `3`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `6 1 9 4 7 2 5 8 0`
  
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses `0` from the end.
   - **Player 2's Number**: `0`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `6 1 9 4 7 2 5 8`

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses `6` from the start.
   - **Player 1's Number**: `3 6`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `1 9 4 7 2 5 8`

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses `8` from the end.
   - **Player 2's Number**: `0 8`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `1 9 4 7 2 5`

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses `1` from the start.
   - **Player 1's Number**: `3 6 1`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `9 4 7 2 5`

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses `5` from the end.
   - **Player 2's Number**: `0 8 5`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `9 4 7 2`

7. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses `9` from the start.
   - **Player 1's Number**: `3 6 1 9`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `4 7 2`

8. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses `2` from the end.
   - **Player 2's Number**: `0 8 5 2`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `4 7`

9. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses `4` from the start.
   - **Player 1's Number**: `3 6 1 9 4`
   - **Updated Sequence**: `7`

10. **Player 2's Turn**:
    - Chooses `7` from the start (only option left).
    - **Player 2's Number**: `0 8 5 2 7`
    - **Updated Sequence**: (empty)

**Final Numbers**:

- **Player 1's Number**: `36194`
- **Player 2's Number**: `08527`

**Scoring**:

- **Player 1's Value**: `36194`
- **Player 2's Value**: `8527` (Note that leading zero is ignored in numerical value)

**Winner**: **Player 1**, because `36194` > `8527`.

### Strategic Considerations

- **High vs. Low Digits**: Prioritize selecting higher digits to build a larger number.
- **Blocking**: Anticipate your opponent's moves. If a high digit is at one end and a low digit at the other, you may need to decide between increasing your own number or preventing your opponent from accessing a high digit.
- **Positioning**: Remember that you always append digits to the **right end** of your number. The order of digits can significantly impact the final value.

## Command-Line Interaction Sample

Assuming a command-line interface where inputs and outputs are displayed textually.

*...and so on until the sequence is depleted.*

## Conclusion
