The action space indices in the gym environment represent the indices of the prime numbers in the `self.primes` list. Each index corresponds to a specific prime number in the list, ranging from 0 to 14 (since there are 15 primes). When a player takes an action by choosing an index, they select the prime number at that index from the list, provided it is a valid move according to the game's rules (available and does not share digits with the opponent's last pick).
