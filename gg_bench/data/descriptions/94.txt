# Bitwise Showdown: Rule Book

Welcome to **Bitwise Showdown**, a strategic two-player turn-based game designed for the command-line interface. Engage in a battle of wits as you manipulate bits to outsmart your opponent and claim victory. This rule book will guide you through the objective, setup, components, turns, rules, scoring, and provide examples to help you get started.

## Objective

The primary goal of **Bitwise Showdown** is to be the first player to transform a shared 4-bit binary number into a multiple of 5 by flipping bits from `0` to `1`. Players take turns flipping bits, and strategic planning is crucial to securing a win. There are no draws; the game continues until one player achieves the objective.

## Setup

1. **Initial Binary Number**: The game starts with a 4-bit binary number set to `0000`.
2. **Player Assignment**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. You can decide who goes first by mutual agreement or by a random method (e.g., coin toss).
3. **Bit Positions**: The bits are numbered from `1` to `4`, from left to right:
   - **Bit 1**: Leftmost bit (most significant bit)
   - **Bit 2**: Second bit from the left
   - **Bit 3**: Third bit from the left
   - **Bit 4**: Rightmost bit (least significant bit)

---

## Game Components

- **Binary Number Display**: Shows the current state of the 4-bit binary number and its decimal equivalent after each turn.
- **Bit Positions**: Identifiable positions (`1` to `4`) for players to select and flip.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen bit positions through the command line.
- **Player Indicators**: The system denotes which player's turn it is.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
2. **Player Action**:
   - On their turn, a player selects one bit position (`1` to `4`) that currently holds a `0` and flips it to `1`.
   - Players cannot flip a bit that is already set to `1`.
3. **Updating the Number**:
   - After a bit is flipped, the binary number is updated.
   - The decimal equivalent of the binary number is calculated and displayed.
4. **Checking for Win Condition**:
   - The game checks if the new decimal number is a multiple of `5`.
   - If it is, the player who made the move wins.
   - If not, the game proceeds to the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Bit Flipping**:
  - Only bits with a value of `0` can be flipped to `1`.
  - Bits are flipped one at a time per turn.
- **Valid Moves**:
  - Selecting a bit position (`1` to `4`) currently set to `0`.
  - Input must be a valid bit position number.
- **Win Condition**:
  - Creating a binary number that is a multiple of `5` (in decimal form).
  - Possible multiples within the 4-bit range (`0` to `15`) are `0`, `5`, `10`, and `15`.
- **Game End**:
  - The game ends immediately when a player creates a multiple of `5`.
  - No further moves are made after a win condition is met.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to create a binary number that is a multiple of `5` wins the game.
- **Tracking Wins**:
  - Players may keep a tally of games won if playing multiple rounds.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game is designed to prevent draws; a win condition will always be met within the available moves.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Starting State

- **Binary Number**: `0 0 0 0`
- **Decimal Equivalent**: `0`

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Flips **Bit 2**.
   - **Binary Number**: `0 1 0 0`
   - **Decimal Equivalent**: `4`
   - **Check**: `4` is not a multiple of `5`.
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Action**: Flips **Bit 4**.
   - **Binary Number**: `0 1 0 1`
   - **Decimal Equivalent**: `5`
   - **Check**: `5` is a multiple of `5`.
   - **Result**: **Player 2 wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction

#### Example Flow

```
Current Binary Number: 0 0 0 0 (Decimal: 0)
Player 1, select a bit to flip (1-4): 2

Bit 2 flipped.
New Binary Number: 0 1 0 0 (Decimal: 4)
No winner yet.

Current Binary Number: 0 1 0 0 (Decimal: 4)
Player 2, select a bit to flip (1-4): 4

Bit 4 flipped.
New Binary Number: 0 1 0 1 (Decimal: 5)
Player 2 has created a multiple of 5!

*** Player 2 wins the game! ***
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the potential outcomes of flipping certain bits and how it may set up your opponent.
- **Bit Value Awareness**:
  - **Bit 1**: Value of `8`
  - **Bit 2**: Value of `4`
  - **Bit 3**: Value of `2`
  - **Bit 4**: Value of `1`
- **Preventing Opponent's Win**: Try to avoid moves that allow your opponent to easily create a multiple of `5` on their next turn.
- **Forced Moves**: In some situations, you can force a win by leaving your opponent with no safe moves.
