The action space consists of 15 discrete actions, representing changing one of the three digits of the safe combination to any number from 1 to 5. The actions are mapped as follows: `position * 5 + (new_digit - 1)`. Here, `position` is the index of the digit to change (0 for the first digit, 1 for the second, 2 for the third), and `new_digit` is the new value for the digit (ranging from 1 to 5). Thus, each position can have 5 possible new values, resulting in a total of 15 actions.
