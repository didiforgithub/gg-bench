In the game, the action space comprises discrete indices 0 to 8, each corresponding to selecting one of the numbers 1 through 9. Specifically, action index 0 maps to selecting number 1, index 1 maps to number 2, and so on, up to index 8 mapping to number 9. Each index thus represents a unique number available for placement into the shared sequence.
