# Number Knot

## Objective

**Be the first player to reduce your opponent's life total to zero or below by strategically selecting numbers from a shared number line and choosing to either enhance your own life total or diminish your opponent's.**

---

## Setup

1. **Life Totals**: Both players start with a life total of **10 points**.
2. **Number Line**: A shared number line is established, consisting of integers from **1 to 9**.

---

## Game Components

- **Player Life Totals**: Numerical values representing each player's current life points.
- **Shared Number Line**: A list of available integers from **1 to 9**. Each number can be selected only once during the game.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
2. **Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: Choose any available number from the shared number line.
   - **Decision**: Opt to either:
     - **Add** the selected number to **your own** life total.
     - **Subtract** the selected number from **your opponent's** life total.
3. **Updating the Game State**:
   - **Remove** the selected number from the number line; it is no longer available for either player.
   - **Adjust Life Totals** accordingly based on the action taken.
4. **End of Turn**: Pass the turn to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can select **any remaining number** from the number line on their turn.
   - Each number can be selected **only once** per game.
2. **Life Total Effects**:
   - When **adding** to your life total, increase it by the selected number.
   - When **subtracting** from your opponent's life total, decrease it by the selected number.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends **immediately** when a player's life total reaches **zero or below**.
   - The player whose opponent's life total reaches zero or below **wins** the game.
4. **No Negative Numbers**:
   - Life totals can go **below zero**; there is no minimum life total.
5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players must choose when to bolster their own life versus when to attack the opponent.
   - Since numbers are limited and cannot be reused, planning ahead is crucial.
