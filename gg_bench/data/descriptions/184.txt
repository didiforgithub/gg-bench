# **Clash of Numbers**

## **Objective**

The primary goal of Clash of Numbers is to be the first player to reach a target score by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool. Players achieve victory by accumulating points through careful number selection, aiming to outmaneuver their opponent. A player wins when they reach or exceed the target score while preventing their opponent from doing the same.

## **Setup**

- **Target Score**: Agree on a target score to win the game (e.g., 50 points).
- **Number Pool**: A shared pool of numbers from 1 to 9 is available for selection.
- **Starting Player**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., coin toss).

## **Game Components**

- **Number Pool (1-9)**: Numbers available for players to select during their turns.
- **Player Score**: Each player has a score that starts at zero.
- **Turn Indicator**: Keeps track of whose turn it is.

## **Turns**

- Players take turns in alternating order.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose a number from the number pool (numbers 1-9).
  2. **Update Score**: Add the selected number to your score.
  3. **Modify Number Pool**: The selected number remains available in the pool for future turns.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, select any number between 1 and 9 from the number pool.
   - The number pool always contains numbers 1 through 9; numbers are not removed after selection.

2. **Scoring Mechanism**:
   - Add the selected number to your current score.

3. **Strategic Twist â€“ Multiples and Factors**:
   - **If your selected number is a multiple of your opponent's last selected number**:
     - **Subtract** your opponent's last selected number from **their** score.
   - **If your selected number is a factor of your opponent's last selected number**:
     - **Subtract** your selected number from **their** score.
   - *Note*: This rule does not apply on the very first turn for each player, as there is no previous number from the opponent.

4. **Score Boundaries**:
   - A player's score cannot go below zero. If a subtraction would result in a negative score, set their score to zero instead.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach **or exceed** the target score at the end of their turn wins the game.
   - If both players reach or exceed the target score in the same round, the player with the higher score wins.
   - If scores are equal after both players reach the target score, the next player to have a higher score at the end of their turn wins.

## **Scoring**

- **Accumulating Points**: Players accumulate points by adding selected numbers to their scores each turn.
- **Strategic Subtractions**: Utilize the multiples and factors rule to reduce your opponent's score strategically.
- **Tracking Scores**: Keep a running total of both players' scores after each turn.
