# Digit Sum Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to construct the largest possible number without exceeding a predetermined digit sum limit. Victory is achieved by strategically selecting and appending digits to build a higher numerical value than your opponent while keeping the sum of your digits within the allowed limit. If a player exceeds the digit sum limit, they lose immediately.

## Setup

1. **Digit Sum Limit**: Agree on a digit sum limit for the game (e.g., 15).
2. **Starting Numbers**: Both players begin with an empty number (zero digits).
3. **Available Digits**: Digits from **1** to **9** are available for selection by each player independently.

## Game Components

- **Digits (1-9)**: The building blocks used by players to construct their numbers. Each digit can be used once per player but may be used by both players independently.
- **Player Numbers**: The numbers constructed by each player by appending selected digits during their turns.
- **Digit Sum Tracker**: Keeps track of the sum of the digits in each player's number to ensure it does not exceed the digit sum limit.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
2. **Actions on a Turn**:
   - **Select a Digit**: Choose any unused digit from **1** to **9**.
   - **Append the Digit**: Add the selected digit to the **end** of your current number.
   - **Update Digit Sum**: Add the value of the selected digit to your digit sum total.
3. **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until neither can make a valid move or a player loses by exceeding the digit sum limit.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - Each digit from **1** to **9** can be used **once per player**.
   - Both players have access to the same set of digits but track usage independently.
2. **Appending Digits**:
   - Digits are appended to the **end** of the player's existing number (e.g., appending **5** to **23** results in **235**).
3. **Digit Sum Limit**:
   - The sum of the digits in a player's number must **not exceed** the agreed-upon digit sum limit.
   - If a move would cause the digit sum to exceed the limit, the player **cannot** select that digit.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player exceeds the digit sum limit upon appending a digit, they **lose immediately**.
5. **Ending the Game**:
   - The game ends when:
     - Both players **cannot make a valid move** (no remaining digits that keep the digit sum within the limit).
     - A player loses by exceeding the digit sum limit.
6. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player with the **larger numerical value** of their constructed number wins, provided they have **not exceeded** the digit sum limit.
   - In case of a tie in numerical value, the player who constructed their number in **fewer turns** wins.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by having the larger number without exceeding the digit sum limit.
- **Immediate Loss**: Exceeding the digit sum limit at any point.
- **Tie-Breaker**: If numerical values are equal, the player who used **fewer digits** (has taken fewer turns) wins.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Gameplay

- **Digit Sum Limit**: 15

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1** selects **9**.
  - Number: **9**
  - Digit Sum: **9**

- **Player 2** selects **8**.
  - Number: **8**
  - Digit Sum: **8**

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 1** selects **6**.
  - Number: **96**
  - Digit Sum: **9 + 6 = 15**

- **Player 2** selects **7**.
  - Number: **87**
  - Digit Sum: **8 + 7 = 15**

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1** cannot select any digit without exceeding the digit sum limit.
  - Available digits: **1-5** (but any would exceed the limit)
  - **Player 1 passes**.

- **Player 2** cannot select any digit without exceeding the digit sum limit.
  - Available digits: **1-6, 9** (but any would exceed the limit)
  - **Player 2 passes**.

**Result**:
- Player 1's number: **96**
- Player 2's number: **87**
- **Winner**: **Player 1**

### Example 2: Strategic Play

- **Digit Sum Limit**: 12

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1** selects **5**.
  - Number: **5**
  - Digit Sum: **5**

- **Player 2** selects **9**.
  - Number: **9**
  - Digit Sum: **9**

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 1** selects **7**.
  - Number: **57**
  - Digit Sum: **5 + 7 = 12**

- **Player 2** cannot select any digit without exceeding the digit sum limit.
  - Available digits: **1-8** (any selection would exceed the limit of 12 when added to current sum of 9)
  - **Player 2 passes**.

**Turn 3**:
- **Player 1** cannot select any more digits without exceeding the digit sum limit.
  - **Player 1 passes**.

**Result**:
- Player 1's number: **57**
- Player 2's number: **9**
- **Winner**: **Player 1**

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of both your digit sum and the remaining digits to avoid being forced to pass.
- **Balance Value and Sum**: High digits increase your number's value quickly but consume the digit sum limit faster.
- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Observe which digits your opponent has used to predict their possible moves.
- **Optimize Turns**: Try to construct a larger number in fewer turns to win tie-breakers.

## Summary

Digit Sum Duel is a quick and strategic game perfect for a command-line interface. Players must balance the desire to build a large number with the constraint of a digit sum limit. With simple mechanics and deep strategy, skilled players can consistently outmaneuver less experienced opponents.
