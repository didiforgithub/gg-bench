In the provided gym environment for "Chain Reaction," the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(19)`, corresponding to the 19 numbers in the number pool (2 to 20). Each action index (0 to 18) maps directly to the numbers 2 to 20, with index 0 representing the number 2, index 1 representing the number 3, and so on, up to index 18, which represents the number 20. This mapping allows players to select a number from the number pool by choosing the corresponding action index.
