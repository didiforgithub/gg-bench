In the "Race to the Center" game environment, the action space is defined with two discrete actions, indexed as follows:

- **Action 0**: This corresponds to moving the player's marker by 1 position towards the center.
- **Action 1**: This corresponds to moving the player's marker by 2 positions towards the center.

These two actions represent the only movement options available to players during their turn, allowing them to strategically progress along the track.
