# Elemental Clash - Rule Book

## Objective

**Elemental Clash** is a two-player turn-based strategy game where players harness elemental powers to defeat their opponent. The primary goal is to reduce your opponent's health points (HP) from 10 to 0 by strategically selecting elements that counter your opponent's choices. Victory is achieved when your opponent's HP drops to zero or below.

## Turns

**Elemental Clash** is played in a series of rounds. Each round consists of the following steps:

1. **Element Selection**
   - Both players **secretly** choose one of the five elements.
   - In a command-line game, each player inputs their choice without revealing it to the opponent.
2. **Reveal**
   - Both players **simultaneously reveal** their chosen elements.
   - In the command-line interface, the game displays both choices after both players have made their selection.
3. **Resolution**
   - Determine the outcome based on the interaction of the chosen elements.
   - Adjust health points accordingly.

Players continue taking turns until one player's HP is reduced to zero or below.

## Rules and Mechanics

## Strategic Depth

While the game mechanics are simple, strategic depth arises from predicting your opponent's choices and countering them. Skilled players can anticipate patterns and select elements that both protect themselves and maximize damage to the opponent. As there are no elements that dominate all others, and each has specific strengths and weaknesses, players must adapt their strategies dynamically.

## Additional Notes

- **Honesty in Element Selection**: Since the game relies on secret selection, honesty is crucial, especially in a command-line environment where inputs may not be truly hidden. It's recommended to implement input masking or agree on trust rules.
- **No Randomness**: The game lacks random elements, emphasizing player strategy over luck.
- **No Draws**: The game's mechanics ensure that it cannot end in a draw, fulfilling the requirement for decisive outcomes.

## Conclusion

**Elemental Clash** offers a quick, easy-to-learn, and strategically rich experience suitable for a command-line interface. With simple rules and the need for tactical thinking, players can engage in intense duels where skill and prediction determine the victor.
