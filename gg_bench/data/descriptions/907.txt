# Divider's Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divider's Duel** is a two-player, turn-based numerical strategy game. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Players take turns dividing a shared number by its proper divisors. The player who makes the last valid move wins the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer called the **Current Number**. The default starting number is **60**, but players can agree on any suitable positive integer greater than 2.
- **Player Roles**: There are two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Players decide who goes first, perhaps by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared positive integer that changes throughout the game based on players' moves.
- **Proper Divisors**: The divisors of the Current Number excluding 1 and the number itself. These are the numbers players can choose to divide the Current Number.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their moves and receive game updates via the command line.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- On their turn, a player must:
  1. **Choose a Proper Divisor** of the Current Number.
  2. **Divide** the Current Number by the chosen divisor.
  3. **Update** the Current Number to the result of the division.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the chosen divisor is a proper divisor of the Current Number (greater than 1 and less than the Current Number).
   - The result of the division must be an integer (no fractions or decimals).

2. **Updating the Current Number**:
   - After a valid division, the Current Number becomes the integer result of the division.
   - The new Current Number is used by the next player on their turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player **loses** if:
     - They cannot make a valid move on their turn because the Current Number is a **prime number** (it has no proper divisors other than 1 and itself).
     - They attempt to make an invalid move (e.g., choosing a non-divisor or resulting in a non-integer).

   - The opposing player **wins** the game.

4. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
- **Tracking**: No points are accumulated; only the win/loss outcome matters.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting the Game**

- Current Number: **60**
- Player 1 and Player 2 decide who goes first. Let's say **Player 1** starts.

---

#### **Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 60
- **Proper Divisors of 60**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1's Move**: Chooses divisor **2**
- **Calculation**: 60 รท 2 = **30**
- **Updated Current Number**: **30**

---

#### **Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 30
- **Proper Divisors of 30**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 2's Move**: Chooses divisor **5**
- **Calculation**: 30 รท 5 = **6**
- **Updated Current Number**: **6**

---

#### **Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 6
- **Proper Divisors of 6**: 2, 3
- **Player 1's Move**: Chooses divisor **3**
- **Calculation**: 6 รท 3 = **2**
- **Updated Current Number**: **2**

---

#### **Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 2
- **Proper Divisors of 2**: None (since 2 is prime)
- **Player 2's Situation**: Cannot make a valid move
- **Result**: **Player 2 loses**, **Player 1 wins**

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

Below is how the game might unfold in a command-line interface.

**Game Start**

```
Welcome to Divider's Duel!
Starting Number: 60

Player 1's turn.
Current Number: 60
Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
Enter your chosen divisor: 2
60 divided by 2 is 30.

Player 2's turn.
Current Number: 30
Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter your chosen divisor: 5
30 divided by 5 is 6.

Player 1's turn.
Current Number: 6
Proper Divisors: 2, 3
Enter your chosen divisor: 3
6 divided by 3 is 2.

Player 2's turn.
Current Number: 2
Proper Divisors: None
2 is a prime number. No valid moves left.
Player 2 cannot make a move. Player 1 wins!
```

## Additional Guidelines

- **Input Validation**: The game should check that players enter valid divisors.
- **Strategy Tips**:
  - Aim to reduce the Current Number to a prime number on your opponent's turn.
  - Be cautious of numbers that have fewer proper divisors.
  - Plan ahead by considering the possible divisors your opponent will have.

- **Custom Starting Number**:
  - Players can agree to start with a different number for variety.
  - Recommended to choose composite numbers to ensure multiple divisors.

## Conclusion

Divider's Duel is a simple yet strategic game that requires players to think ahead and make calculated moves. The rules are straightforward, making it easy to code and play via a command-line interface. The absence of a draw mechanism ensures that each game concludes with a definitive winner, and skilled players can consistently outmaneuver less experienced opponents through strategic play.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
