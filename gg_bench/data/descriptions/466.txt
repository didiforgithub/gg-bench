# Shadow Capture: A Two-Player Turn-Based Strategy Game

## Objective

**Shadow Capture** is a strategic two-player turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to capture all of your opponent's shadows while protecting your own. A player achieves victory by successfully capturing all opposing shadows, leading to the opponent's defeat.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, with positions labeled from `(1,1)` to `(5,5)`.
2. **Starting Positions**:
   - Player 1's shadows start on the leftmost column (`x=1`), occupying rows `(1,1)` to `(5,1)`.
   - Player 2's shadows start on the rightmost column (`x=5`), occupying rows `(1,5)` to `(5,5)`.
3. **Initial Shadows**: Each player begins with five shadows, one on each row of their respective starting columns.

## Game Components

- **Shadows**:
  - Representation: Each shadow is represented by a unique identifier (`S1` for Player 1 and `S2` for Player 2).
  - Functionality: Shadows can move, cast, and capture opponent shadows.
  - Attributes: Each shadow has an energy level starting at `3`.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Action Phase**: The player can perform one of the following actions with each shadow:
     - **Move**: Move a shadow to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
     - **Cast**: Extend a shadow to an adjacent cell to attempt a capture.
 2. **Energy Phase**: Shadows regenerate `1` energy point if they did not move during the Action Phase.
- **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their turn, the next player begins their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- Shadows can move to any adjacent cell that is not occupied by another shadow (friendly or opposing).
- Moving a shadow reduces its energy by `1`.
- Shadows cannot move outside the bounds of the 5x5 grid.

### Casting Shadows

- A shadow can cast to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) to attempt to capture an opponent's shadow.
- Casting costs `2` energy points.
- If the cast lands on a cell occupied by an opponent's shadow, the opponent's shadow loses `1` energy point.
- If an opponent's shadow's energy drops to `0`, it is captured and removed from the board.

### Energy Mechanics

- Each shadow has an energy level ranging from `0` to `5`.
- Energy is reduced when performing actions:
  - Moving: `-1` energy.
  - Casting: `-2` energy.
- Shadows that do not move during the Action Phase regain `1` energy during the Energy Phase.
- A shadow's energy cannot exceed `5`.

### Capturing Shadows

- A shadow with `0` energy is captured and removed from the board.
- Capture opposing shadows by reducing their energy to `0` through casting.
- The goal is to capture all of the opponent's shadows.

### Special Abilities

- **Overcharge**: If a shadow reaches `5` energy, it can perform an **Overcharge Cast** on its next turn.
  - Overcharge Cast costs all `5` energy points.
  - The cast affects all adjacent cells simultaneously.
  - Opponent shadows hit by an Overcharge Cast lose `2` energy points instead of `1`.

## Scoring

- There is no point system; the game is won by capturing all of the opponent's shadows.
- The progression of the game is tracked by the number of remaining shadows each player has on the board.

## Examples

### Sample Turn

**Scenario**:
- It's Player 1's turn.
- Player 1 has a shadow (`S1`) at position `(3,3)` with `3` energy.
- Player 2 has a shadow (`S2`) at position `(3,4)` with `2` energy.

**Player 1's Action Phase**:
- Chooses to have `S1` cast towards `(3,4)`.

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 1's Turn:
Shadow S1 at (3,3) with 3 energy.
Choose action for S1:
1. Move
2. Cast
Selection: 2
Enter target coordinates for casting (up, down, left, right from current position):
Target Position: (3,4)
Casting successful. S2 at (3,4) loses 1 energy.
```

**Result**:
- Player 1's `S1` now has `1` energy (`3 - 2` from casting).
- Player 2's `S2` at `(3,4)` now has `1` energy (`2 - 1` from being hit).

**Player 1's Energy Phase**:
- Since `S1` performed an action, it does not regain energy.

### Overcharge Example

**Scenario**:
- Player 2's shadow (`S2`) at `(5,3)` has `5` energy.
- Surrounding opponent shadows at `(4,3)`, `(5,2)`, and `(5,4)`.

**Player 2's Action Phase**:
- Chooses to perform an Overcharge Cast with `S2`.

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 2's Turn:
Shadow S2 at (5,3) with 5 energy.
Overcharge available!
Do you want to perform an Overcharge Cast? (y/n): y
Overcharge Cast executed. All adjacent opponent shadows lose 2 energy.
```

**Result**:
- `S2` now has `0` energy and is captured after the action.
- Opponent shadows at `(4,3)`, `(5,2)`, and `(5,4)` each lose `2` energy.
- Any of those shadows whose energy drops to `0` are captured.

## Game End

- The game ends immediately when one player has no remaining shadows on the board.
- The player who still has shadows remaining is declared the winner.

## Strategy Tips

- Balance movement and energy management; sometimes staying still to regain energy is beneficial.
- Anticipate your opponent's moves and position your shadows to defend or attack strategically.
- Utilize Overcharge wisely; sacrificing a shadow might lead to capturing multiple opponent shadows.
