# Number Merge

## Objective

Be the first player to create the target number (15) by strategically merging numbers from a shared pool. A player wins immediately upon successfully creating the target number during their turn.

## Setup

- **Target Number**: 15.
- **Shared Pool**: Contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 at the start of the game.
- **Players**: Two players take turns alternately. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.

## Game Components

- **Shared Pool of Numbers**: A dynamic list of numbers available to both players. Initially `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- **Target Number**: The number **15**, which players aim to create through merging.
- **Merge Actions**: Combining two numbers from the shared pool to form a new number.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

- **Merge Action**: On your turn, you must merge two numbers from the shared pool.
  - **Selection**: Choose any two numbers available in the shared pool.
  - **Merging**: Add the two numbers together to create a new number.
- **Adding the New Number**:
  - If the new number is **less than or equal to 15**, add it to the shared pool.
  - If the new number is **greater than 15**, it cannot be added to the pool, but the two original numbers are still removed.
- **Removing Used Numbers**: The two numbers used in the merge are always removed from the shared pool, regardless of whether the new number is added.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Merging Numbers

- **Available Numbers**: Only numbers currently in the shared pool can be selected for merging.
- **Valid Merges**: The sum of the two selected numbers must be **15 or less** to be added back into the pool.
  - If the sum is **greater than 15**, the new number is discarded, and the original numbers are removed.
- **Mandatory Action**: If at least two numbers are in the shared pool, a player must perform a merge on their turn.
- **No Passes**: Players cannot skip their turn or pass; they must merge if possible.
  
### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: A player wins **immediately** when they create the target number (15) and add it to the shared pool during their turn.
- **Game Continuation**: If neither player has created the target number, the game continues with the next player's turn.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player wins.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Resource Management**: Players must carefully choose which numbers to merge to avoid helping the opponent.
- **Anticipation**: Consider which numbers will remain in the shared pool after your turn and how they might benefit your opponent.
- **Blocking**: Players can attempt to remove numbers that the opponent may need to prevent them from winning.

## Scoring

There is no point system. The first player to successfully create the target number (15) during their turn wins the game.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Shared Pool
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

#### **Player 1's Turn**

- **Action**: Merge 4 and 5.
- **Calculation**: 4 + 5 = 9.
- **Add to Pool**: 9 is less than 15; add it to the pool.
- **Remove Used Numbers**: Remove 4 and 5.
- **Shared Pool After Turn**:
  ```
  [1, 2, 3, 9]
  ```

#### **Player 2's Turn**

- **Action**: Merge 3 and 9.
- **Calculation**: 3 + 9 = 12.
- **Add to Pool**: 12 is less than 15; add it to the pool.
- **Remove Used Numbers**: Remove 3 and 9.
- **Shared Pool After Turn**:
  ```
  [1, 2, 12]
  ```

#### **Player 1's Turn**

- **Action**: Merge 2 and 12.
- **Calculation**: 2 + 12 = 14.
- **Add to Pool**: 14 is less than 15; add it to the pool.
- **Remove Used Numbers**: Remove 2 and 12.
- **Shared Pool After Turn**:
  ```
  [1, 14]
  ```

#### **Player 2's Turn**

- **Action**: Merge 1 and 14.
- **Calculation**: 1 + 14 = 15.
- **Add to Pool**: 15 equals the target number; add it to the pool.
- **Remove Used Numbers**: Remove 1 and 14.
- **Shared Pool After Turn**:
  ```
  [15]
  ```
- **Result**: Player 2 has created the target number 15 and **wins the game** immediately.

### Alternative Scenario

If a player makes a merge that results in a number greater than 15:

#### **Player's Turn**

- **Action**: Merge 9 and 7.
- **Calculation**: 9 + 7 = 16.
- **Add to Pool**: 16 is greater than 15; do not add to pool.
- **Remove Used Numbers**: Remove 9 and 7.
- **Shared Pool After Turn**:
  ```
  Remaining numbers after removal.
  ```
- **Note**: The player does not win, and the game continues. The opponent now has fewer numbers to work with, which might be advantageous.
