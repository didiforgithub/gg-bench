# Randomizer Challenge: Rule Book

## Objective

**Randomizer Challenge** is a two-player turn-based game where players compete to be the first to reach *exactly* **50 points**. Players must strategically decide whether to **add** or **multiply** random numbers to their score without exceeding the target. If a player's score surpasses 50, they reset to zero, adding a layer of risk and strategy. The first player to reach **exactly 50 points** wins the game.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Starting Scores**: Both players start with a score of **0**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by mutual agreement or a coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Scores**: Numerical values representing each player's current total, starting at 0.
- **Random Number Generator**: Utilized to generate random numbers within specified ranges during the game.

## Turns

On each turn, the active player performs the following actions:

1. **Choose an Action**:
   - **Add**: Opt to add a random number to your score.
   - **Multiply**: Opt to multiply your score by a random number.

2. **Generate Random Number**:
   - If **Add** was chosen: Generate a random integer between **1 and 10** (inclusive).
   - If **Multiply** was chosen: Generate a random integer between **2 and 5** (inclusive).

3. **Update Score**:
   - Perform the chosen mathematical operation (**addition** or **multiplication**) using the generated random number.
   - Update your score accordingly.

4. **Check for Reset**:
   - If your score exceeds **50**, your score resets to **0** immediately.

5. **End Turn**:
   - The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Actions

- **Add**:
  - Generates a random number between **1 and 10**.
  - The generated number is **added** to the player's current score.

- **Multiply**:
  - Generates a random number between **2 and 5**.
  - The player's current score is **multiplied** by the generated number.

### Scoring and Winning

- **Target Score**:
  - The objective is to reach **exactly 50 points**.
  - Surpassing 50 points results in a **score reset** to **0**.

- **Score Reset**:
  - If a player's score exceeds 50 after their turn, their score is reset to 0 immediately.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to reach **exactly 50 points** at the end of their turn wins.
  - The game cannot end in a draw.

### Additional Rules

- **Random Number Generation**:
  - Use a reliable method to generate random numbers within the specified ranges.
  - Both players must agree on the method of random number generation (e.g., built-in functions, random number tables).

- **Transparency**:
  - All random numbers generated and calculations performed must be visible to both players to ensure fairness.

- **Valid Inputs**:
  - Players must choose between the two valid actions: **Add** or **Multiply**.
  - No other operations or number ranges are permitted.

## Scoring

- **Score Tracking**:
  - Keep track of both players' scores after each turn.
  - Scores should be clearly displayed or communicated to both players.

- **Calculations**:
  - Ensure all calculations are accurate.
  - Miscalculations should be corrected immediately upon discovery.

- **Addition Control**:
  - Adding gives you more control over your score increments, especially when nearing 50.

- **Observing Opponent**:
  - Keep track of your opponent's score and adjust your strategy accordingly.

## Conclusion

**Randomizer Challenge** combines luck and strategic decision-making in a simple yet engaging game. With every choice between adding or multiplying, players must weigh the potential rewards against the risks of overshooting the target score. May the best strategist win!
