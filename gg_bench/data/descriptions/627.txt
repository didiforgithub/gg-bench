# Operator Outwit

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the **target number** exactly by strategically applying mathematical operations to a shared **current number**. Use addition, multiplication, or subtraction wisely to outmaneuver your opponent. The player who reaches the target number exactly on their turn wins the game. If a player's move causes the current number to exceed the target number, they lose immediately.

## Setup

1. **Determine the Target Number**: Agree on a target number to reach. For a standard game, the target number is **23**.
2. **Initialize the Current Number**: Set the current number to **1** at the start of the game.
3. **Player Roles**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that starts at 1 and changes as players apply operations.
- **Target Number**: The number that players aim to reach exactly with the current number (e.g., 23).
- **Operations**:
  - **Add 2** (`+2`)
  - **Multiply by 2** (`*2`)
  - **Subtract 1** (`-1`)

These operations are the only allowed moves, and each player can choose any one of them on their turn.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display the Current Number**: At the beginning of each turn, announce the current number.
  2. **Choose an Operation**: The player selects one of the allowed operations to apply to the current number.
  3. **Apply the Operation**: Calculate the new current number after applying the chosen operation.
  4. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**:
     - If the new current number **equals** the target number, the player **wins**.
     - If the new current number **exceeds** the target number, the player **loses** immediately.
     - If neither condition is met, the turn passes to the other player with the updated current number.
  5. **Announce the Result**: Communicate the operation used and the new current number.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Allowed Operations**: On each turn, a player must choose **one** of the following operations to apply to the current number:
   - **Add 2** (`+2`)
   - **Multiply by 2** (`*2`)
   - **Subtract 1** (`-1`)
2. **Operational Restrictions**:
   - The current number **cannot drop below 1**. If an operation would result in a number less than 1, that operation is invalid, and the player must choose a different one.
3. **Win Condition**:
   - A player **wins** if they reach the target number **exactly** on their turn.
4. **Loss Condition**:
   - A player **loses** if the current number **exceeds** the target number as a result of their operation.
5. **Turn Passing**:
   - If the current number is neither equal to nor exceeds the target number after the operation, the turn passes to the other player.
6. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players **cannot skip** their turn or pass; they must choose an allowable operation.
7. **Validity of Moves**:
   - If a player selects an invalid operation (e.g., results in a current number less than 1), they must choose a valid operation instead.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who reaches the target number exactly on their turn wins the game.
- **Losing the Game**: The player who causes the current number to exceed the target number loses the game.
- **Single Round Play**: The game is typically played in a single round. For extended play, players can keep track of wins over multiple rounds.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Target Number**: 23  
**Current Number**: Starts at 1

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 1
- **Player 1's Move**: Multiply by 2 (`*2`)
- **Calculation**: 1 * 2 = 2
- **New Current Number**: 2
- **Announce**: "I used *2. The current number is now 2."

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Current Number**: 2
- **Player 2's Move**: Add 2 (`+2`)
- **Calculation**: 2 + 2 = 4
- **New Current Number**: 4
- **Announce**: "I used +2. The current number is now 4."

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 4
- **Player 1's Move**: Multiply by 2 (`*2`)
- **Calculation**: 4 * 2 = 8
- **New Current Number**: 8
- **Announce**: "I used *2. The current number is now 8."

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Current Number**: 8
- **Player 2's Move**: Add 2 (`+2`)
- **Calculation**: 8 + 2 = 10
- **New Current Number**: 10
- **Announce**: "I used +2. The current number is now 10."

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 10
- **Player 1's Move**: Multiply by 2 (`*2`)
- **Calculation**: 10 * 2 = 20
- **New Current Number**: 20
- **Announce**: "I used *2. The current number is now 20."

#### Turn 6: Player 2

- **Current Number**: 20

- **Player 2's Move**: Add 2 (`+2`)
- **Calculation**: 20 + 2 = 22
- **New Current Number**: 22
- **Announce**: "I used +2. The current number is now 22."

#### Turn 7: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 22

- **Player 1's Move**: Add 2 (`+2`)
- **Calculation**: 22 + 2 = 24

- **New Current Number**: 24

- **Result**: The current number exceeds the target number (24 > 23). **Player 1 loses**.

- **Announce**: "I used +2. The current number is now 24. I have exceeded the target number. Player 2 wins!"

### Strategy Tips

- **Avoid Exceeding the Target**: Always calculate the potential new current number before making a move to ensure you won't exceed the target.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves and plan your operations to force them into a losing position.
- **Control the Multiplication**: Using multiplication can rapidly increase the current number. Use it wisely to avoid overshooting the target.
- **Use Subtraction Strategically**: Subtracting 1 can be a crucial move to adjust the current number and control the flow of the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is an example of how the game might be played in a command-line interface:
