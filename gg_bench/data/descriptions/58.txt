# Divisor Duel - Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player numerical game. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to **1** or forces your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Victory is achieved by strategically selecting divisors of the shared number to control the gameplay and outmaneuver your opponent.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number (N):**
   - Agree on a positive integer greater than **1** to start the game (e.g., **N = 100**).
   - This number will be the shared value that players manipulate during the game.

2. **Determine Player Order:**
   - Decide who will play first by mutual agreement or by using a random method such as a coin toss.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):**
  - A positive integer that both players will divide during their turns.

- **Divisors:**
  - Proper divisors of the current shared number **N**.
  - A proper divisor is an integer greater than **1** and less than **N** that divides **N** evenly (without leaving a remainder).

- **Players:**
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2**, taking turns alternately.
  - No additional pieces, tokens, boards, or cards are needed.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Identify Valid Divisors:**
     - List all proper divisors of the current shared number **N**.
   - **Select a Divisor:**
     - Choose one of the valid proper divisors.
   - **Divide the Shared Number:**
     - Calculate the new value of **N** by dividing it by the chosen divisor:
       \[
       N = \frac{N}{\text{chosen divisor}}
       \]
   - **Announce the Move:**
     - Inform the opponent of the chosen divisor and the new value of **N**.

3. **Example of a Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 60
   - **Valid Divisors:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
   - **Player's Choice:** Divides by 4
   - **New N:** \( 60 \div 4 = 15 \)
   - **Announcement:** "I divide by 4; N is now 15."

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Proper Divisors Only:**
   - On each turn, players must choose a proper divisor of **N**.
   - The divisor must be:
     - Greater than **1**.
     - Less than **N**.
     - A number that divides **N** without a remainder.

2. **No Valid Move:**
   - If **N** is a prime number or **1** at the start of a player's turn, and therefore has no proper divisors, the player cannot make a move and **loses** the game.

3. **Updating N:**
   - After a valid division, the new value of **N** becomes the current shared number for the next player's turn.

4. **No Passing or Skipping:**
   - Players cannot pass their turn or skip making a move if a valid divisor exists.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game ends when:
     - A player reduces **N** to **1** on their turn. This player **wins**.
     - A player cannot make a valid move because **N** is prime or **1** at the start of their turn. This player **loses**, and the opponent **wins**.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory Conditions:**
  - There is no point or score tracking.
  - The outcome is determined by the win/loss condition at the end of the game.
    - **Win:** Successfully reduce **N** to **1** or force the opponent into an impossible move.
    - **Loss:** Unable to make a valid move on your turn.

- **Strategic Depth:**
  - Skilled play involves anticipating future moves and manipulating **N** to limit the opponent's options.
  - Understanding the properties of numbers, particularly divisibility and prime numbers, enhances strategic advantage.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number \( N = 48 \)**

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - **Valid Divisors of 48:** 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24
  - **Player 1 Chooses:** Divides by 16
  - **Calculation:** \( 48 \div 16 = 3 \)
  - **Announcement:** "I divide by 16; N is now 3."

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - **Current N:** 3
  - **Valid Divisors:** None (3 is prime)
  - **Outcome:** Player 2 cannot make a move and loses.
  - **Winner:** Player 1

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a starting number of \( N = 30 \)

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Game Output:**
     ```
     Current N is 30.
     Valid divisors are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
     ```
   - **Player Input:**
     ```
     15
     ```
   - **Game Output:**
     ```
     You chose to divide by 15. N is now 2.
     ```

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Game Output:**
     ```
     Current N is 2.
     No valid divisors available. You cannot make a move.
     Player 1 wins!
     ```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Forcing Prime Numbers:**
  - Aim to reduce **N** to a prime number on your opponent's turn to prevent them from making a move.

- **Choosing Divisors:**
  - Larger divisors may reduce **N** more quickly but could lead to unfavorable positions.
  - Smaller divisors may prolong the game but offer more control over the subsequent numbers.

- **Anticipating Moves:**
  - Consider the possible divisors that will be available to your opponent after your move.
  - Plan ahead to limit their options and steer the game toward a win.
