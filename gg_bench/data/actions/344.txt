In the game environment, each index in the action space corresponds directly to a specific prime number in the list `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]`. The action space is represented by a discrete space of 9 actions, where each index from 0 to 8 maps to the prime numbers in increasing order. For example, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the prime number 2, index 1 corresponds to 3, and so on up to index 8, which corresponds to 23. This mapping allows players to select a prime by simply choosing its corresponding index in the action space.
