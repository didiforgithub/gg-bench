**Rule Book: Capture the Crown**

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Capture the Crown** is to locate and capture your opponent's hidden Crown piece before they capture yours. Players achieve victory by strategically deducing the location of the opponent's Crown based on clues provided after each attack.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Player Grids**:
   - Each player has their own **3x3 grid**, representing their territory.
   - Grids are labeled with **rows (1 to 3)** and **columns (1 to 3)**.
     - Example:
       ```
       (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
       (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)
       (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)
       ```

2. **Placing the Crown**:
   - Each player secretly places their **Crown** on one of the nine cells in their grid.
   - The position of the Crown is kept hidden from the opponent.

3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Both grids are empty except for the hidden Crown.
   - Players have a means to record their own attacks and the clues received.

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Grids**:
   - Two separate 3x3 grids, one for each player.

2. **Crown Pieces**:
   - Each player has one Crown piece placed secretly on their grid.

3. **Records**:
   - Players maintain personal records of attacks made and clues received.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss).
   - Turns alternate between players.

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Attack Phase**:
     - The attacking player announces a coordinate to attack on the opponent's grid (e.g., "Attack on (2,3)").
   - **Response Phase**:
     - The defending player checks if the attacked coordinate matches the location of their Crown.
     - **If a Miss**:
       - The defending player says "Miss."
       - Provides one clue about their Crown's location (see **Rules and Mechanics**).
     - **If a Hit**:
       - The defending player says "Hit."
       - The attacking player wins the game.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Attacking**:
   - On their turn, a player attacks by announcing a coordinate (row and column) on the opponent's grid.
   - Valid coordinates are from (1,1) to (3,3).

2. **Defending and Providing Feedback**:
   - After an attack, the defending player must:
     - Indicate if the attack is a "Miss" or a "Hit."
     - If a "Miss," provide **one** clue about the Crown's location.
     - If a "Hit," the game ends with the attacker winning.

3. **Clues After a Miss**:
   - The defending player chooses **one** of the following clues to provide:
     1. **Row Hint**:
        - Indicate if the Crown's row is **greater than**, **less than**, or **equal to** the attacked row.
     2. **Column Hint**:
        - Indicate if the Crown's column is **greater than**, **less than**, or **equal to** the attacked column.
   - Example:
     - If the attack was on (2,2) and the Crown is on (3,1), the defender might say:
       - "Miss. My Crown's row is greater than 2."

4. **Recording Information**:
   - Players should keep track of:
     - Coordinates they've attacked.
     - Results of each attack (Hit/Miss).
     - Clues provided after each Miss.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game is won immediately when a player successfully hits the opponent's Crown.
   - There are no draws or stalemates.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Analyzing Clues**:
  - Use the clues to narrow down possible locations.
  - Keep in mind that each clue only tells you about one coordinate (row or column).

- **Recording Moves**:
  - Write down all attacks and responses to avoid repeating moves.
  - Create a mini-map to visualize possible Crown locations.

- **Predicting Moves**:
  - Anticipate your opponent's strategy based on the clues they provide.
  - If they consistently provide the same type of clue, use this pattern to your advantage.

- **Balancing Offense and Defense**:
  - While focusing on finding the opponent's Crown, be mindful of the clues you provide.
  - Consider which clue will give away less information.
