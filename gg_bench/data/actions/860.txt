In the custom gym environment for BitFlip, the action space is defined as a discrete space with a size equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the starting number (31, which has a binary form of 11111). Each action index corresponds directly to a bit position in this binary string, numbered from left to right. When a player selects an action by choosing an index, they are choosing to flip the '1' bit at the corresponding position in the binary string to '0'. This mapping allows players to make strategic decisions based on the current state of the binary number during their turn.
