The action space in the game consists of indices from 0 to 80, representing all possible two-digit combinations where each digit is between 1 and 9. Each index corresponds to a specific guess as follows:

- The first digit of the guess is derived from integer division of the index by 9, plus 1: `digit1 = index // 9 + 1`.
- The second digit of the guess is derived from the modulus operation on the index by 9, plus 1: `digit2 = index % 9 + 1`.

This mapping ensures each index uniquely identifies a guess consisting of two digits, both ranging from 1 to 9.
