In the provided Python gym environment for "Capture Quest," the action space indices correspond directly to the territories on the game board. The index mapping is as follows:

- Index 0: Territory A
- Index 1: Territory B
- Index 2: Territory C
- Index 3: Territory D
- Index 4: Territory E

Each action taken by a player is represented by choosing an index from 0 to 4, which determines where a player places their token on the game board.
