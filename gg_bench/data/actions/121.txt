In the game, the action space consists of 50 discrete actions, corresponding to 10 possible positions on the Number Line and 5 possible numbers from the Number Pool. Each action index represents a combination of a position and a number, calculated as:

- **Position Index**: The first digit in the division result when the action index is divided by 5 (i.e., `action // 5`) determines the position on the Number Line (0 to 9).
- **Number**: The remainder when the action index is divided by 5, plus one (i.e., `(action % 5) + 1`), determines the number (1 to 5) to place at the chosen position.

Essentially, each action index uniquely maps to a specific position-number pair, allowing players to choose where and what to place during their turn.
