# Ten Stack Duel

## Objective

The objective of **Ten Stack Duel** is to be the first player to create a sum of **exactly 10** with the top two numbers on the stack. You win the game when the number you place on top of the stack, combined with the number immediately beneath it, sums to 10. Be careful not to exceed a sum of 10, or you'll lose the game!

## Setup

- **Number Stack**: Start with an empty stack in the game.
- **Number Pool**: Both players have unlimited access to numbers from **1** to **9**.

---

## Game Components

### Number Stack

- A shared stack where players place numbers during their turns.
- It grows as numbers are added and is central to gameplay.

### Number Pool

- Numbers **1** through **9** are available for both players to use.
- Each number can be selected multiple times; there is an unlimited supply.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- On your turn, you must choose a number from the Number Pool and place it on top of the Number Stack.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Adding Numbers**:
   - On your turn, select any number between **1** and **9** (inclusive) and place it on top of the Number Stack.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - **Win the game** if the sum of the number you place and the number immediately beneath it equals **exactly 10**.
   - Example: If the top number is **6** and you place a **4**, the sum is **6 + 4 = 10**, and you win.

3. **Losing Condition**:
   - **Lose the game** if, after your move, the sum of the top two numbers exceeds **10**.
   - Example: If the top number is **7** and you place a **5**, the sum is **7 + 5 = 12**, which exceeds 10, and you lose.

4. **Continuing Play**:
   - If the sum of the top two numbers is **less than 10**, the game continues with the next player's turn.
   - Example: If the top number is **3** and you place a **4**, the sum is **3 + 4 = 7**.

5. **First Move Exception**:
   - On the **first turn**, since there is no number beneath, you cannot win or lose the game.
   - The game proceeds to the next player's turn.

6. **Number Reusability**:
   - Numbers from **1** to **9** can be used repeatedly.
   - There is an unlimited supply of each number in the Number Pool.
