In the Quantum Edge gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 10) correspond directly to the positions (1 to 11) on the quantum grid. An index in the action space represents a player's move to claim the node at that corresponding position on the grid. For instance, choosing index 0 corresponds to claiming node 1 on the grid, index 1 corresponds to node 2, and so forth, up to index 10 corresponding to node 11.
