# Multiplication Duel

## Objective

**Multiplication Duel** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach or exceed a target number—**100**—by multiplying a shared running total using numbers from a limited pool. Players must strategically choose multipliers to advance the total while blocking their opponent's options. Victory is achieved by reaching or surpassing the target number on your turn.

## Setup

1. **Initialize the Game**:
   - Set the shared running total to **1**.
   - Define the target number as **100**.

2. **Prepare the Multiplier Pool**:
   - Create a list of multipliers ranging from **2** to **9**.
   - Each multiplier can only be used **once** per game.

3. **Determine Turn Order**:
   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

4. **Display Initial Information**:
   - Show the starting total (**1**).
   - List available multipliers (**2-9**).

## Game Components

- **Shared Running Total**:
  - A number that starts at **1** and is updated each turn by multiplication.
  
- **Multipliers Pool**:
  - Numbers from **2** to **9**.
  - Each multiplier is **unique** and can be used only once per game.
  - Once a multiplier is used, it's **removed** from the pool.

- **Target Number**:
  - The goal is to reach or exceed **100**.

- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2** alternate turns.

## Turns

### Turn Structure:

1. **Announcement**:
   - Display the current running total.
   - List available multipliers.

2. **Action**:
   - The active player selects an unused multiplier from the pool.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Multiply the running total by the chosen multiplier.
   - Update the running total with the new value.

4. **Validation**:
   - Check if the new total is **greater than or equal to 100**.

5. **Turn Completion**:
   - If the target is reached or exceeded, the game ends.
   - If not, remove the used multiplier from the pool.
   - Pass the turn to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Multiplier Selection**:
   - On your turn, you must choose an unused multiplier between **2** and **9**.
   - You cannot skip your turn or pass.

2. **Unique Usage**:
   - Each multiplier can be used **only once** per game.
   - Keep track of used multipliers to avoid repetition.

3. **Calculations**:
   - Multiplication only; no addition, subtraction, or division.
   - Calculate accurately to ensure the correct running total.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - If after your turn the running total is **equal to or exceeds 100**, you win.
   - If both players have used all available multipliers without reaching 100, the player with the **higher running total** wins.

5. **Strategic Play**:
   - Anticipate your opponent's options based on remaining multipliers.
   - Aim to leave your opponent with less advantageous multipliers.

6. **Draws**:
   - There are **no draw conditions**; the game must end with a winner.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - Achieved by being the first to reach or exceed the target running total of **100** on your turn.

- **In Case of Multiplier Depletion**:
  - If all multipliers are used and **no player has reached 100**, the player with the **highest running total** wins.

- **No Points System**:
  - The game does not use points; winning is based solely on achieving the objective.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Initial Setup:

- **Running Total**: 1
- **Available Multipliers**: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Total**: 1
- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **5**
- **Calculation**: 1 × 5 = 5
- **Running Total**: **5**
- **Available Multipliers**: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Current Total**: 5
- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **9**
- **Calculation**: 5 × 9 = 45
- **Running Total**: **45**
- **Available Multipliers**: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Total**: 45
- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **3**
- **Calculation**: 45 × 3 = 135
- **Running Total**: **135**
- **Result**: Running total is **≥ 100**; **Player 1 wins**.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

#### Start of Game:

```
Current Total: 1
Available Multipliers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a multiplier: 5

New Total: 5
Used Multipliers: 5
```

#### Next Turn:

```
Current Total: 5
Available Multipliers: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a multiplier: 9

New Total: 45
Used Multipliers: 5, 9
```

#### Subsequent Turn:

```
Current Total: 45
Available Multipliers: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a multiplier: 3

New Total: 135
Used Multipliers: 3, 5, 9

Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider how your choice will affect the next turn and limit your opponent's options.
- **Multiplier Impact**: Higher multipliers can rapidly increase the total but may give your opponent an opportunity to win if not timed correctly.
- **Resource Management**: Keep track of used multipliers to anticipate which options remain for both you and your opponent.
- **Defensive Play**: Sometimes it's beneficial to choose a lower multiplier to avoid setting up your opponent for a win on their next turn.

## Game Summary

Multiplication Duel is a fast-paced, strategic game that combines simple arithmetic with tactical foresight. It's easy to code and provides depth for players to develop and refine their strategies. With a clear objective and straightforward rules, it's an engaging game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent.
