In the code, the action space is defined as a discrete set corresponding to the allowed operations. Each index in the action space maps to a specific operation as follows:

- Action index `0` corresponds to the operation `+1`.
- Action index `1` corresponds to the operation `+2`.
- Action index `2` corresponds to the operation `+3`.
- Action index `3` corresponds to the operation `x2`.

These indices are used to select and apply an operation to the current number during a player's turn.
