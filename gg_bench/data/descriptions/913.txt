**Game Title: Battle of Divisibility**

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player able to make a valid move by strategically selecting numbers based on divisibility rules. Players aim to outmaneuver their opponent by leaving them without a valid number to choose, thus securing victory.

---

### **Setup**

- **Number Pool**: A shared list of integers from **2** to **50**.
- **Starting Conditions**:
  - All numbers in the pool are available for selection.
  - Players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., coin toss).

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Number Pool**:
   - Integers from **2** to **50**, inclusive.
   - Each number can be selected only once.
2. **Selection History**:
   - A record of numbers already chosen by both players.
3. **Players**:
   - **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Sequence**:
  - Players alternate turns, starting with the designated first player.
- **During a Turn**:
  1. **Selection**:
     - The player selects an available number from the pool that is either:
       - A **divisor** or **multiple** of the **previous number** selected by the opponent.
  2. **Validation**:
     - The selected number must not have been previously chosen.
     - The number must satisfy the divisibility condition relative to the opponent's last number.
  3. **Recording**:
     - The chosen number is removed from the pool and added to the selection history.
- **First Turn Exception**:
  - The first player can choose **any number** from the pool on their initial turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Divisibility Requirement**:
   - On each turn (except the first), a player **must** select a number that is a divisor or multiple of the opponent's last chosen number.
     - **Divisor**: The number divides the opponent's last number without a remainder.
     - **Multiple**: The number is a product of the opponent's last number and an integer.
2. **Valid Moves**:
   - If multiple valid numbers are available, the player may choose any of them.
   - If no valid numbers are available, the player loses the game.
3. **Number Usage**:
   - Each number from the pool can be selected only **once**.
   - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool.
4. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The **opponent** of the player who cannot make a move is declared the **winner**.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**:
  - The winner is the player who successfully leaves their opponent without a valid move.
- **No Points System**:
  - The game does not utilize a points system; victory is determined solely by the ability to make valid moves according to the rules.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering the numbers that will be available to your opponent after your turn.
- **Avoid Low Divisibility Numbers**: Selecting prime numbers may limit your opponent's options, as they have fewer divisors.
- **Control High Multiples**: Picking numbers with many multiples can give you control over the flow of the game.
- **Monitor the Pool**: Keep track of which numbers have been used to avoid accidental invalid moves.
