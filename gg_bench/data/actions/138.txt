In the game environment's action space, there are 20 discrete actions, each corresponding to a number from 1 to 20. Specifically, the action with index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `1`, the action with index `1` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, and so forth, up to the action with index `19`, which corresponds to selecting the number `20`. This mapping effectively translates an action index to a game move by adding 1 to the action index.
