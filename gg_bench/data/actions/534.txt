In the gym environment for Sequence Builder, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing indices from 0 to 8. Each index directly corresponds to a number from the Number Pool, where index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 maps to the number 2, and so forth up to index 8, which maps to the number 9. Thus, when a player selects an action, they are choosing the number `(action index + 1)` from the Number Pool. Once chosen, the number is removed from the pool and added to the player's sequence.
