In the gym environment for Factor Frenzy, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(29)`, which means there are 29 discrete actions corresponding to selecting numbers from 2 to 30 from the shared list. Each action index maps to the number `index + 2`. Therefore, action index 0 corresponds to selecting number 2, action index 1 to selecting number 3, and so on, up to action index 28 which corresponds to selecting number 30.
