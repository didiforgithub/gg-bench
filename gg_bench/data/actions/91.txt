In the game, the action space is represented with 8 discrete actions, each mapped to a pair of movement directions and a challenge option:

- **Actions 0 to 3**: Movement without a challenge
  - `0`: Move up
  - `1`: Move down
  - `2`: Move left
  - `3`: Move right

- **Actions 4 to 7**: Movement with a challenge
  - `4`: Move up and initiate a challenge
  - `5`: Move down and initiate a challenge
  - `6`: Move left and initiate a challenge
  - `7`: Move right and initiate a challenge

Each action involves moving to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) with or without the option to challenge the opponent if adjacent afterward.
