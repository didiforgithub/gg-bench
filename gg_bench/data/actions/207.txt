In the game "Bit Flip," the action space indices correspond directly to the bit positions in the 8-bit binary number. The action space is `Discrete(8)`, representing bit positions indexed from `0` to `7`, mapping to game bit positions `1-8`. When a player selects an action `i` within this action space, it refers to flipping the bit at position `i` (0-indexed) from `0` to `1`. This updates the binary number accordingly in the game.
