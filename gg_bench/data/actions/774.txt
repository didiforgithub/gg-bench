In the given gym environment for the game "Last Digit Duel," the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(8)`, representing actions with indices from `0` to `7`. Each action index corresponds to a multiplier used in the game as follows:

- Action index `0` corresponds to multiplier `2`
- Action index `1` corresponds to multiplier `3`
- Action index `2` corresponds to multiplier `4`
- Action index `3` corresponds to multiplier `5`
- Action index `4` corresponds to multiplier `6`
- Action index `5` corresponds to multiplier `7`
- Action index `6` corresponds to multiplier `8`
- Action index `7` corresponds to multiplier `9`

This linear mapping implies that the action space indices are simply an offset of `2` from their respective multipliers in the game.
