The action space indices in the game environment map to game moves as follows:

- The action space consists of 16 discrete actions, represented by numbers 0 through 15.
- These actions correspond to the 8 possible split positions in the sequence, each allowing for two choices in parts: left or right.
- Each action index, `i`, represents a combination of a split position and a part choice:
  - The split position is determined by `i // 2 + 1`. This converts the index into a split position from 1 to 8, indicating where the sequence is divided.
  - The part choice (left or right) is determined by `i % 2`. A result of 0 means selecting the left part, and a result of 1 means selecting the right part.
  
Thus, action space indices uniquely determine both the split position and which part of the sequence is chosen by the player.
