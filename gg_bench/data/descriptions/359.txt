# Pattern Match Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to collect all the numbers in your secret pattern by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool while preventing your opponent from completing their pattern.

---

## Setup

1. **Shared Number Pool**: A set of numbers from **1 to 20** is displayed and accessible to both players.

2. **Secret Patterns**:
   - Each player privately selects a sequence of **five unique numbers** from **1 to 20** to form their secret pattern.
   - The secret pattern should **not be revealed** to the opponent.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**: Numbers **1 through 20**, initially all available.
- **Player Patterns**: Each player's secret sequence of 5 numbers, known only to that player.
- **Player Collections**: Numbers each player has collected during the game.

---

## Turns

- Players take turns **alternately**, starting with **Player 1**.
- On each turn, a player selects **one number** from the shared pool.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection

- **On their turn**, a player selects **one** number from the shared number pool.
- The selected number is **removed** from the shared pool and **added to the player's collection**.

### 2. Collection and Tracking

- Players keep track of the numbers they have collected.
- Players aim to **collect all the numbers** in their secret pattern.

### 3. Blocking

- Since numbers are **removed** from the shared pool once selected, a player can **hinder their opponent** by selecting numbers they suspect are in the opponent's pattern.

### 4. Winning the Game

- The first player to **collect all five numbers** in their secret pattern **wins the game**.

### 5. Game End Condition

- If **all numbers** in the shared pool are exhausted and **neither player** has completed their pattern:
  - The player who has collected **more numbers** from their pattern **wins**.
  - If both players have collected the **same number** of their pattern numbers, the game proceeds into a **sudden death round**.

### 6. Sudden Death Round

- Players **reveal their remaining pattern numbers**.
- Starting with any **remaining numbers** (if available), players take turns selecting, aiming to collect their remaining pattern numbers.
- The first to collect all their pattern numbers **wins**.
- If no numbers are left, the game is a **tie**.
