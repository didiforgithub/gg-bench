The action space in the Binary Battle gym environment is represented by discrete indices corresponding to specific moves. Here's the mapping:

- **Actions 0-3**: Flip the current player's bit at positions 0 through 3. These actions change a `0` to a `1` in the player's own 4-bit binary number.
  - Action 0: Flip own bit at position 0
  - Action 1: Flip own bit at position 1
  - Action 2: Flip own bit at position 2
  - Action 3: Flip own bit at position 3

- **Actions 4-7**: Reset the opponent's bit at positions 0 through 3. These actions change a `1` to a `0` in the opponent's 4-bit binary number.
  - Action 4: Reset opponent's bit at position 0
  - Action 5: Reset opponent's bit at position 1
  - Action 6: Reset opponent's bit at position 2
  - Action 7: Reset opponent's bit at position 3

- **Action 8**: Pass action, used if there are no other valid moves available.
