In the game, territories are numbered from 1 to 9 as shown on the board. The action space indices in the Python code are zero-based, ranging from 0 to 8, corresponding to territories 1 to 9, respectively. This means action index 0 represents claiming territory 1, action index 1 represents claiming territory 2, and so on, up to action index 8 representing territory 9. This zero-based index aligns with Python's typical array indexing, while the game board uses a one-based numbering for territories.
