In the game, the action space indices from 0 to 4 correspond to selecting numbers 1 to 5 respectively. This mapping means that when a player chooses an action index, the environment converts it to the corresponding game number by adding 1 to the index. Thus, action index 0 maps to move 1, index 1 to move 2, index 2 to move 3, index 3 to move 4, and index 4 to move 5.
