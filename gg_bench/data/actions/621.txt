In the "Last Digit Standing" gym environment, the action space indices (0-8) map directly to the possible digit selections (1-9) in the game. Specifically, each index corresponds to a digit choice by adding 1 to the index value. For example, the action index 0 corresponds to selecting the digit 1, index 1 corresponds to digit 2, and so on, up to index 8 which corresponds to digit 9. This mapping ensures that all valid game moves are represented within the action space.
