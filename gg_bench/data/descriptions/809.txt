# The Even-Steven Game Rule Book

## Objective

**Be the first player to reduce the shared starting number to zero through strategic operations.**

- Players take turns performing allowed operations on a shared number.
- The primary goal is to force the shared number down to zero.
- **Victory Condition:** The player who reduces the shared number exactly to zero on their turn wins the game.
- **Loss Condition:** If a player cannot perform any allowed operation on their turn (e.g., the number is already zero before their turn), they lose.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number:** The game begins with a shared positive integer, typically **15**. (Players may agree on a different starting number for variation.)
2. **Player Roles:** Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number:**

  - A single positive integer visible to both players.
  - This number changes throughout the game based on players' actions.

- **Allowed Operations:**

  - **Subtract 1 (-1):** Decrease the shared number by 1.
  - **Divide by 2 (/2):** If the shared number is even, divide it by 2.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.
2. **Turn Structure:**

   - **Evaluate Options:** On their turn, a player examines the current shared number and determines which allowed operations can be performed.
   - **Choose an Operation:** The player selects one operation from the allowed options:
     - **Subtract 1 (-1)**
     - **Divide by 2 (/2)** (only if the shared number is even)
   - **Update Shared Number:** The chosen operation is applied, and the shared number is updated accordingly.
   - **Announce Move:** The player announces their move and the new shared number.
3. **Turn Progression:** The updated shared number is now used by the next player for their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Allowed Operations Details:**

  1. **Subtract 1 (-1):**

     - Always available on any positive shared number.
     - Reduces the shared number by exactly 1.

  2. **Divide by 2 (/2):**

     - Available **only if the shared number is even**.
     - Divides the shared number by 2 (integer division).

- **Winning the Game:**

  - **Victory Condition:** The player who reduces the shared number to exactly **zero** on their turn wins immediately.
  - **Forced Loss:** If a player starts their turn and the shared number is already zero, they lose the game (since they cannot make a move).

- **Forbidden Moves:**

  - Players **cannot** perform operations that would result in negative numbers.
  - Players must perform an operation on their turn if at least one allowed operation is available.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:** The winner is the first player to reach the shared number of zero through the allowed operations.
- **Tracking Progress:** No points are awarded; the focus is on strategic reduction of the shared number.
- **Match Play (Optional):** Players may keep track of wins over multiple games to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

  - Options: Subtract 1 or Divide by 2.
  - **Action:** Divide by 2.
  - **Shared Number after Move:** 14 / 2 = **7**.
  - **Announcement:** "I divide by 2. The number is now 7."

#### Turn 3:

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Shared number is **7** (odd).
  - Options: Subtract 1.
  - **Action:** Subtract 1.
  - **Shared Number after Move:** 7 - 1 = **6**.

#### Turn 5:

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Shared number is **3** (odd).
  - Options: Subtract 1.
  - **Action:** Subtract 1.
  - **Shared Number after Move:** 3 - 1 = **2**.
  - **Announcement:** "I subtract 1. The number is now 2."

#### Turn 6:

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - Shared number is **2** (even).
  - Options: Subtract 1 or Divide by 2.
  - **Action:** Divide by 2.
  - **Shared Number after Move:** 2 / 2 = **1**.
  - **Announcement:** "I divide by 2. The number is now 1."

#### Turn 7:

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Shared number is **1** (odd).
  - Options: Subtract 1.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead:**

  - Anticipate the results of your moves and how they'll affect your opponent's options.
  - Aim to force the shared number into a value that limits your opponent's moves.

- **Even and Odd Numbers:**

  - **Even Numbers:** Offer more options (subtract or divide), providing flexibility.
  - **Odd Numbers:** Restrict options to only subtracting 1, which can be used to control the flow of the game.

- **Controlling the Game:**

  - Try to create situations where your opponent receives an odd number, limiting their choices.
  - Use division strategically to reduce the shared number more rapidly.

## Variations

- **Different Starting Numbers:**

  - Choose a larger starting number for a longer game or a smaller one for a quicker match.
  - Example starting numbers: 7, 21, 31, etc.

- **Additional Operations (Advanced Play):**

  - Introduce new allowed operations for added complexity:
    - **Subtract 2 (-2):** Subtract 2 from the shared number (only if the number is 2 or greater).
    - **Multiply by 0.5 (*0.5):** Another way to represent division by 2.

- **Time Limits:**

  - Implement a time limit per turn to increase the challenge and pace.

## Conclusion

The Even-Steven Game is a simple yet strategically rich game that challenges players to think ahead and manipulate the shared number to their advantage. With easy-to-understand rules and quick gameplay, it provides an engaging experience that is both easy to code and enjoyable to play in a command-line interface.
