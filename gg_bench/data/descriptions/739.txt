# Game Title: Equation Duel

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
In Equation Duel, two players compete to form a valid arithmetic equation using three unique numbers they collect from a shared pool. The first player to successfully create an equation of the form `A + B = C`, using the numbers they've collected, wins the game.

**Victory Condition:**  
- **Win:** A player wins by being the first to collect numbers that satisfy the equation `A + B = C`.
- **Loss:** A player loses if the opponent achieves the victory condition first.

There is no draw mechanism; the game continues until a player wins.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool Initialization:**  
   Create a shared pool of integers from **1** to **9**.

2. **Starting Conditions:**  
   - Both players start with an empty hand.
   - All numbers in the pool are unclaimed and available for selection.

3. **Player Assignment:**  
   Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool:**  
  A list of available numbers from **1** to **9**.

- **Player Hands:**  
  Each player has a hand (collection) where they hold the numbers they've selected.

- **Numbers (1-9):**  
  - **Appearance:** Represented by their numerical value (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `9`).
  - **Functionality:** Numbers are used to form the equation `A + B = C`.
  - **Unique Attributes:** Once a number is selected by a player, it is no longer available in the number pool.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Turn Order:**  
   Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.

2. **Actions During a Turn:**  
   - **Select a Number:**
     - Choose any one available number from the number pool.
     - Add the selected number to your hand.
     - Remove the selected number from the number pool.
   - **Check for Victory:**  
     After adding the number to your hand, check if you can form a valid equation `A + B = C` with the numbers in your hand.

3. **Progression of Turns:**  
   - The game continues with players alternately taking turns until one player achieves the victory condition.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Number Selection:**
   - On your turn, you **must** select one number from the number pool.
   - You **cannot** skip a turn or select multiple numbers.

2. **Hand Limitations:**
   - There is no limit to the number of numbers you can hold in your hand.
   - Numbers in your hand remain until the game ends.

3. **Forming Equations:**
   - You are trying to collect numbers that satisfy `A + B = C`, using **three distinct numbers** from your hand.
   - Each number **must be unique**; you cannot use the same number more than once in the equation.
   - The equation must be arithmetically correct.

4. **Victory Declaration:**
   - If you can form a valid equation on your turn **after** selecting a number, you **immediately** declare victory.
   - Provide the equation to demonstrate your win (e.g., `2 + 3 = 5`).

### Special Mechanics

- **Blocking Strategy:**  
  Players can select numbers not only to build their equations but also to prevent the opponent from obtaining certain numbers they might need.

- **No Reuse of Numbers:**  
  Since numbers are removed from the pool once selected, they cannot be used by both players.

## Scoring

There is no point scoring system. The game is a race to achieve the victory condition.

- **Winning the Game:**  
  The player who first forms a valid `A + B = C` equation wins the game.

- **Tracking Progress:**  
  Players keep track of the numbers in their own hands and the numbers remaining in the pool.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

#### Initial State

- **Number Pool:** `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`
- **Player 1 Hand:** Empty

   - **Player 1 Hand:** `5`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9`
   - **Checks for Victory:** Cannot form an equation yet.

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Action:** Selects number `2`.
   - **Player 2 Hand:** `2`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9`
   - **Checks for Victory:** Cannot form an equation yet.

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Action:** Selects number `3`.
   - **Player 1 Hand:** `5, 3`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9`
   - **Checks for Victory:** Cannot form an equation yet.

4. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Player 1 Hand:** `5, 3, 2`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 4, 6, 8, 9`
     - Note: Number `2` was already selected by Player 2 and is unavailable.
     - **Correction:** Number `2` is unavailable. Player 1 must choose a different number.
   - **Action:** Selects number `8`.
   - **Player 1 Hand:** `5, 3, 8`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 4, 6, 9`
   - **Checks for Victory:** Cannot form an equation yet.

6. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Player 2 Hand:** `2, 7, 6`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 4, 9`
   - **Checks for Victory:**
     - Can form `2 + 6 = 8`. But `8` is not in hand.
     - Cannot form an equation yet.

7. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Action:** Selects number `4`.
   - **Player 1 Hand:** `5, 3, 8, 4`
   - **Number Pool:** `1, 9`
   - **Checks for Victory:**
     - **Forms Equation:** `4 + 5 = 9`
     - **But** `9` is not in hand.
     - **Forms Equation:** `3 + 5 = 8`
     - **Victory Declared!**

### Command-Line Interaction

#### Starting the Game

```
Welcome to Equation Duel!

Number Pool: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Player 1, it's your turn.
Select a number from the pool: 5
```

#### Progressing Turns

```
Number Pool: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Player 2, it's your turn.
Select a number from the pool: 2

Number Pool: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Player 1, it's your turn.
Select a number from the pool: 3
```

#### Attempting Victory

```
Number Pool: [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]
Player 1, it's your turn.
Select a number from the pool: 4

Number Pool: [1, 9]
Player 1's Hand: [5, 3, 8, 4]
Checking for victory...
You have formed the equation: 3 + 5 = 8
Player 1 wins the game!
```

### Strategic Considerations

- **Blocking:**  
  Player 2 could have selected `8` to prevent Player 1 from forming `3 + 5 = 8`.

- **Prediction:**  
  Players should pay attention to the numbers the opponent is collecting and anticipate possible equations they might form.

## Conclusion

Equation Duel is a simple yet strategic game that can be easily implemented in a command-line interface. It requires players to think ahead and adjust their strategy based on their opponent's moves. The game is quick, ensures a clear winner, and allows skilled players to consistently outplay unskilled opponents through strategic number selection and prediction.
