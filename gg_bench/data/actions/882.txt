In the given gym environment for the game **Line Battle**, the action space is represented by a discrete space with two indices corresponding to the possible moves a player can make:

- **Action 0**: Move "Marker A" one position closer to "Marker B".
- **Action 1**: Move "Marker B" one position closer to "Marker A".

These indices map directly to the moves available on a player's turn, allowing them to strategically advance their chosen marker toward the opposing marker to achieve a game-winning position.
