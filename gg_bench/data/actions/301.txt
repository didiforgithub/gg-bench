The action space indices in the game map to pairs of simultaneous actions taken by both players. Each index corresponds to a specific combination of actions as follows:

0: (Charge, Charge)  
1: (Charge, Shield)  
2: (Charge, Blast)  
3: (Shield, Charge)  
4: (Shield, Shield)  
5: (Shield, Blast)  
6: (Blast, Charge)  
7: (Blast, Shield)  
8: (Blast, Blast)  

These indices represent all possible combinations of moves that can be chosen by Player 1 and Player 2 each turn, where the first element in the tuple is Player 1's action and the second element is Player 2's action.
