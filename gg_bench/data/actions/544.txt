In the action space of the gym environment, each action index from 0 to 9 corresponds to selecting a unique number from 1 to 10 in the game. Specifically, an action index `i` maps to the move of choosing the number `i + 1`. Thus, action index 0 maps to choosing 1, index 1 to choosing 2, and so forth, up to index 9 which maps to choosing 10. This mapping allows players to select any unused number directly through its respective action index.
