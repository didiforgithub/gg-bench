The action space indices in the game map to specific moves that involve splitting the current number into two integers and choosing which number to keep. Each action index corresponds to a tuple `(N, a, b, keep_choice)`, where `N` is the current number, `a` and `b` are the two integers that sum to `N`, and `keep_choice` indicates whether to keep `a` ("keep_a") or `b` ("keep_b") as the new current number. The discarded number, which is not kept, must be greater than 1. This mapping predefines all valid possible splits for each number up to the maximum limit.
