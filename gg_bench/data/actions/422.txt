The action space indices in the game map directly to the digits that can be subtracted from the current value of N. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which means there are 9 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 8. Each index corresponds to a subtraction move involving one of the digits from 1 to 9. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to the digit 1, index 1 corresponds to the digit 2, and so on, with index 8 corresponding to the digit 9. This mapping facilitates selecting which digit to subtract based on the available digits in N during a player's turn.
