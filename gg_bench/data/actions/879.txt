In the given gym environment for the "Divide and Conquer" game, the action space is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to `N_max` inclusive. Each index in this space represents a possible action of choosing a proper divisor of the current shared number `N`. Only indices that correspond to proper divisors of `N` (excluding 1 and `N` itself) are considered valid actions. When a player selects an action, the index is used to directly identify the divisor to divide `N` by. Invalid indices, which do not correspond to a proper divisor, result in an invalid move and end the game for the player.
