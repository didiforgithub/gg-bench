In the provided gym environment, each index in the action space corresponds to a specific number token that a player can use on their turn. The mapping is as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the number token 1.
- Index 1 corresponds to the number token 2.
- Index 2 corresponds to the number token 3.
- Index 3 corresponds to the number token 4.
- Index 4 corresponds to the number token 6.
- Index 5 corresponds to the number token 7.
- Index 6 corresponds to the number token 8.
- Index 7 corresponds to the number token 9.

These indices are used to select the number from the player's hand and determine the addition to the running total during a player's turn.
