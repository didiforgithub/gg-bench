In the gym environment for Factor Frenzy, the action space indices (0 to 19) correspond directly to the numbers (1 to 20) in the number pool. Each index represents the number obtained by adding 1 to the index value. Therefore, selecting an action with index `i` is equivalent to choosing the number `i + 1` from the pool.
