The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(21)`, meaning it includes integers from 0 to 20. Each integer corresponds to a potential move where the player subtracts that number from the current counter value. Only the indices that represent valid divisors at a given state (i.e., proper divisors, or 1 if the counter is prime) are considered valid actions. Invalid actions (indices) result in an immediate termination of the game with a penalty, while valid actions proceed with counter reduction and turn switching.
