The action space in the game consists of 64 discrete actions, which are mapped to two types of operations: flipping and swapping bits. 

1. **Flip Actions (indices 0-7):** Each of the first 8 action indices corresponds to flipping a single bit in the binary string. Specifically, index `n` (where `n` is between 0 and 7) flips the bit at position `n` in the string.

2. **Swap Actions (indices 8-63):** The remaining 56 action indices represent pairwise swaps of bits between two different positions. For each pair of distinct bit positions `(i, j)` where `i â‰  j`, an action index maps to swapping the bits at these positions. The swap actions are organized starting from index 8, where `i` and `j` iterate over all possible pairs of positions from 0 to 7.
