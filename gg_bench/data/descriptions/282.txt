# Digit Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Digit Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach the *target number* exactly by applying allowed mathematical operations to your current number. Overshooting the target number results in an immediate loss. The game requires foresight and planning, ensuring that a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled opponent.

---

## Setup

1. **Determine the Target Number**:
   - At the beginning of the game, randomly select a target number between **20** and **30** (inclusive). This can be done using a random number generator in the command-line interface.
   - *Example*: The target number is **25**.

2. **Initial Player Numbers**:
   - Both players start with the number **1** as their current number.
   - Decide which player will take the first turn (Player 1 and Player 2).

---

## Game Components

- **Players' Current Numbers**:
  - Each player maintains their own current number throughout the game.

- **Allowed Operations**:
  - Players can perform the following operations on their current number during their turn:
    1. **Add 1**: Increment the current number by 1.
    2. **Subtract 1**: Decrement the current number by 1 (cannot go below 1).
    3. **Multiply by 2**: Multiply the current number by 2.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - On their turn, a player performs **one** of the allowed operations on their current number.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After performing an operation, the player's turn ends, and it becomes the other player's turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Applying Operations**:
   - **Add 1**:
     - Increases the current number by 1.
   - **Subtract 1**:
     - Decreases the current number by 1.
     - The current number cannot go below 1. Attempting to subtract 1 from 1 is not allowed.
   - **Multiply by 2**:
     - Multiplies the current number by 2.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach the target number **exactly** wins the game.

3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's current number **exceeds** the target number after their turn, they immediately lose the game.
     - *Example*: If the target number is 25 and a player's current number becomes 26 after their turn, they lose.

4. **Strategic Play**:
   - Players must plan their moves carefully to reach the target number without overshooting it.
   - Anticipating the opponent's moves can provide a strategic advantage.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - The winning player is the one who reaches the target number exactly.
  - Alternatively, if the opponent overshoots the target number, the player wins by default.

- **No Points System**:
  - The game does not use a points system; victory is determined by achieving the objective.
