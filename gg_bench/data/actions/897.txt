The action space indices range from 0 to 12, corresponding directly to the indices of the 13 squares on the linear game board, which are numbered 1 through 13. Each index in the action space represents a specific square on the board, where an action corresponds to claiming that square for the current player. For instance, an action with index 0 maps to claiming square 1, action with index 1 maps to claiming square 2, and so on, up to index 12 mapping to square 13. This one-to-one mapping facilitates the implementation of the game moves within the environment.
