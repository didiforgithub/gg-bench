The action space indices in the gym environment map directly to the numbers available in the game, where each index `i` corresponds to selecting the number `i + 1`. For example, an action with index `0` selects the number `1`, an action with index `1` selects the number `2`, and so on up to index `9`, which selects the number `10`.
