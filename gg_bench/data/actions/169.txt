In the gym environment for the Number Knockout game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(20)`, which means it includes integers 0 through 19. These integers correspond to the numbers 1 through 20 in the game. Each action index `i` in the action space equates to selecting the game number `i + 1`. Therefore, an action of 0 selects the number 1, an action of 1 selects the number 2, and so on, up to an action of 19 selecting the number 20.
