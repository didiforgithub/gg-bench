# Number Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to **capture all of your opponent's numbers**. Utilize strategic selection and timing to outmaneuver your opponent. Victory is achieved when your opponent has no numbers remaining in their set.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Range Selection**:
   - Determine the value of **N**, the maximum number in each player's set. A recommended starting value is **N = 10**.
   
2. **Initial Number Sets**:
   - Each player receives a set of unique numbers ranging from **1 to N** inclusive.
   - Example for **N = 10**:
     - Player 1's Numbers: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`
     - Player 2's Numbers: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`

3. **Determine First Attacker**:
   - Decide randomly or mutually agree on which player will take on the role of **attacker** in the first round.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Sets**:
  - Each player has their own set of numbers from **1 to N**.
  - Numbers represent the strength of an **attack** or **defense**.
  - Used numbers are **removed** from the player's set according to the game rules.

- **Roles**:
  - **Attacker**: The player initiating the challenge in a round.
  - **Defender**: The player responding to the attack in a round.

- **Captured Numbers**:
  - Numbers that have been lost during the game and are no longer available for play.

---

## Turns

1. **Round Structure**:
   - The game proceeds in rounds, with each round consisting of:
     - **Attacker's Turn**: The attacker selects a number to use for the attack.
     - **Defender's Turn**: The defender selects a number to use for defense.
   
2. **Role Alternation**:
   - After each round, roles switch:
     - The previous defender becomes the new attacker.
     - The previous attacker becomes the new defender.

3. **Simultaneous Selection**:
   - Both players select their numbers **privately and simultaneously**.
   - Selections are revealed at the same time to ensure fairness.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection

- **Attacker**:
  - Chooses any one number from their remaining set to initiate an attack.
- **Defender**:
  - Chooses any one number from their remaining set to defend against the attack.

### Reveal and Outcome

1. **Reveal**:
   - Both players reveal their selected numbers simultaneously.

2. **Outcome Determination**:
   - **Attack Success**:
     - If the attacker's number is **greater than** the defender's number, the attack is successful.
   - **Defense Success**:
     - If the defender's number is **greater than or equal to** the attacker's number, the defense is successful.

### Number Resolution

- **Successful Attack**:
  - The defender's number is **captured** and removed from their set.
  - The attacker's number **remains** in their set and can be used again.
- **Successful Defense**:
  - The attacker's number is **captured** and removed from their set.
  - The defender's number **remains** in their set and can be used again.

### Captured Numbers

- **Removal**:
  - Captured numbers are permanently removed from the game.
- **Availability**:
  - Remaining numbers can be reused in future rounds unless captured.

### Victory Condition

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins when their opponent has **no numbers remaining** in their set after the numbers have been resolved at the end of a round.

### Special Cases

- **Last Numbers Used**:
  - If both players have only one number left and both numbers are captured in the same round, the **defender wins the game**.
- **No Valid Moves**:
  - If a player cannot select a number because they have none remaining at the start of their turn, they **lose the game**.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - The winner is the player who captures all of their opponent's numbers.
- **No Point System**:
  - The game does not track points; victory is achieved through elimination.

- The game proceeds until one player has all their numbers captured.

### Endgame Scenario

## Strategic Tips

- **Predict Opponent's Moves**:
  - Pay attention to the numbers your opponent has used and which ones remain.
- **Conserve High Numbers**:
  - Save your higher numbers for critical moments or when defending against expected strong attacks.
- **Bluffing**:
  - Use lower numbers when you suspect your opponent might use a lower number, conserving higher numbers for future rounds.
- **Role Strategy**:
  - Adjust your strategy based on whether you're the attacker or defender. Defenders have the advantage when numbers are equal.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Game Variations**:
  - For a shorter game, use a smaller N (e.g., N = 5).
  - For more complexity, increase N or introduce special numbers with unique properties.
  
- **Fair Play**:
  - Ensure that both players cannot see each other's selections until both have made their choices.

- **Game Balance**:
  - The rules are designed to prevent draws and ensure that skillful play leads to victory.
