The action space indices 0-15 correspond directly to the 16 squares on the 4x4 grid, where each index represents a specific square on the board: 

- Index 0 corresponds to the square at Row 1, Column 1.
- Index 1 corresponds to the square at Row 1, Column 2.
- ...
- Index 14 corresponds to the square at Row 4, Column 3.
- Index 15 corresponds to the square at Row 4, Column 4.

Index 16 is a special action representing the decision to "pass" a turn if no valid moves are available. The mapping ensures that each action corresponds to a direct move or choice within the game environment.
