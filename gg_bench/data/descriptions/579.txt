# Even-Odd Battle Rule Book

## Objective

**Even-Odd Battle** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to accumulate more points than your opponent by strategically adding numbers to a running total. Players earn points by turning the total into an even number or a multiple of 5. The game ends when the total reaches or exceeds 25, and the player with the highest score wins.

## Setup

- **Starting Total**: The game begins with a total of **0**.
- **Player Scores**: Both players start with **0 points**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., Player 1 and Player 2).

## Game Components

- **Running Total**: A single number that players will add to during the game. It starts at 0 and is updated each turn.
- **Player Scores**: Each player has an individual score that accumulates points earned during the game.
- **Number Choices**: On their turn, players can choose an integer between **1 and 5** (inclusive) to add to the running total.

## Turns

1. **Player's Action**: On their turn, a player chooses a number from **1 to 5** to add to the running total.
2. **Updating Total**: The chosen number is added to the running total.
3. **Scoring**: After the total is updated, check for scoring opportunities:
   - If the new total is **even**, the player earns **1 point**.
   - If the new total is a **multiple of 5**, the player earns **2 points**.
   - If the total satisfies both conditions (e.g., it is both even and a multiple of 5), the player earns points for both conditions (total **3 points**).
4. **Turn Progression**: The turn passes to the opponent.
5. **Game End**: The game continues until the running total reaches or exceeds **25**.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Number Selection**: Players must choose an integer between **1 and 5** (inclusive) on their turn.
- **Valid Moves**: Any number within the allowed range can be chosen regardless of previous moves.
- **Scoring Conditions**:
  - **Even Total**: If the running total is divisible by 2, earn **1 point**.
  - **Multiple of 5**: If the running total is divisible by 5, earn **2 points**.
- **End of Game**: When the total reaches or exceeds 25 after a player's turn, the game ends immediately.
- **Victory Condition**: The player with the **higher score** at the end of the game wins.
- **No Draws**: If scores are tied at the end, the **last player to have taken a turn loses**.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Scores**: Players keep a cumulative score throughout the game based on the points earned each turn.
- **Winning the Game**: Focus on maximizing your score while possibly limiting your opponent's scoring opportunities.
