The action space in the CustomEnv gym environment is defined with 7 discrete actions, corresponding to the following moves:

- Action 0: Flip switch 1.
- Action 1: Flip switch 2.
- Action 2: Flip switch 3.
- Action 3: Flip switch 4.
- Action 4: Flip switches 1 and 2 simultaneously.
- Action 5: Flip switches 2 and 3 simultaneously.
- Action 6: Flip switches 3 and 4 simultaneously.

These actions represent the two possible operations (flip a single switch or flip two adjacent switches) that a player can perform during their turn.
