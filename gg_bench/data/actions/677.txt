The action space indices in the CustomEnv gym environment are mapped to game moves as follows:

- **Actions 0-6**: Each index corresponds to flipping a single switch at the respective position. For example, action 0 flips the switch at position 0, action 1 flips the switch at position 1, and so on up to action 6 flipping the switch at position 6.

- **Actions 7-12**: Each index corresponds to flipping two adjacent switches starting at the respective position. For example, action 7 flips switches at positions 0 and 1, action 8 flips switches at positions 1 and 2, and so on up to action 12 which flips switches at positions 5 and 6.
