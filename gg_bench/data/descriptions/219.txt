**Prime Conquest**

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to collect a total of **five unique prime numbers** by strategically selecting numbers and challenging your opponent's choices.

---

**Setup:**

- **Number Pool:** A shared pool of numbers ranging from **2 to 100**.
- **Player Collections:** Both players start with an empty collection of prime numbers.
- **First Turn:** Decide randomly (e.g., coin toss) which player goes first.

---

**Game Components:**

1. **Number Pool (2-100):**
   - A list of integers from 2 to 100 inclusive.
   - Represents the available numbers that players can select.

2. **Player Collections:**
   - Each player maintains a personal list of prime numbers they have collected.
   - Tracks progress toward the goal of collecting five primes.

3. **Prime Verification Mechanism:**
   - A method (algorithm or function) to determine if a selected number is prime.
   - Essential for validating selections and resolving challenges.

---

**Turns:**

- Players take turns in an alternating fashion.
- On your turn, you must choose to either:
  1. **Select a Number** from the pool.
  2. **Challenge** the opponent's last selected number.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

### 1. Selecting Numbers:

- **Choosing a Number:**
  - On your turn, you may select any remaining number from the number pool.
  - Announce your selection to your opponent.

- **Prime Verification:**
  - After a number is selected, its primality is verified using the Prime Verification Mechanism.
  - **If the number is prime:**
    - It is added to your collection.
  - **If the number is composite:**
    - It is discarded from the game.
    - **Penalty:** You lose your next turn.

### 2. Challenging Opponent's Selection:

- **When to Challenge:**
  - Instead of selecting a number, you may challenge the opponent's **last selected number** if you believe it is not prime.
  - You cannot challenge any earlier selections.

- **Challenge Resolution:**
  - The challenged number's primality is verified.
  - **Successful Challenge (Number is composite):**
    - The number is discarded.
    - **Reward:** You steal one prime number from the opponent's collection (if any).
    - **Penalty for Opponent:** They lose their next turn.
  - **Failed Challenge (Number is prime):**
    - **Penalty:** You lose one prime number from your collection (if any).
    - **Reward for Opponent:** They gain an extra turn immediately after.

- **Limitations:**
  - You cannot challenge if the opponent has not made a selection on their last turn (e.g., if they skipped a turn due to a penalty).
  - A number can only be challenged once.

### 3. General Rules:

- **Unique Numbers:**
  - Once a number is selected and resolved, it is removed from the number pool and cannot be selected again.
- **Collections:**
  - Players cannot have duplicate prime numbers in their collection.
- **Zero Primes Situation:**
  - If a penalty requires a player to lose a prime number but their collection is empty, no primes are lost.
- **Winning Condition:**
  - The first player to have **five unique prime numbers** in their collection wins the game.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Tracking Collections:**
  - Players keep a visible record of their collected prime numbers.
  - Collections are updated after each turn.

- **Winning the Game:**
  - Monitor the number of primes in both collections.
  - The game ends immediately when a player reaches five primes.
