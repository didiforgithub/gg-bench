In the Grid Hunt gym environment, the action space consists of 50 discrete actions. These are divided into two types of actions:

1. **Scan Actions (0-24):** 
   - Indices 0 to 24 represent the `Scan` action at each of the 25 grid locations. 
   - Each index corresponds to a specific coordinate on the 5x5 grid, where the index can be converted to a coordinate using integer division and modulus operations (i.e., `row, column = divmod(index, 5)`).

2. **Dig Actions (25-49):**
   - Indices 25 to 49 represent the `Dig` action at the respective grid locations.
   - These indices can be converted by subtracting 25 to get the corresponding Scan index, which is then converted to coordinates in the same manner as the Scan actions. 

This setup allows players to specify their desired grid coordinate to either scan for a distance to the treasure or dig in an attempt to locate the treasure.
