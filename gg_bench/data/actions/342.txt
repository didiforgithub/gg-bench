The mapping between the action space indices and moves in the game is defined as follows: each action index (ranging from 0 to 18) corresponds to selecting a number from 2 to 20. Specifically, action index 0 maps to the number 2, index 1 maps to 3, continuing sequentially up to index 18 which maps to the number 20. This mapping directly links the integer index from the action space to a specific number used for an attack in the game, ensuring each number can be chosen only once.
