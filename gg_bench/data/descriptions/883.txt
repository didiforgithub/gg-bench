# Number Nexus: A Strategic Grid Game

## Objective

The objective of Number Nexus is to be the player with the highest total score by strategically selecting numbers from a shared grid. Players take turns choosing numbers, aiming to maximize their own score while limiting their opponent's options. The game ends when no more valid moves can be made, and the player with the highest total score wins.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: Generate a 5x5 grid filled with random integers ranging from 1 to 9. Each cell in the grid contains one number.
2. **Starting Conditions**: Both players begin with a score of zero.
3. **First Player**: Determine who goes first (e.g., by a coin toss or random selection).

Example Initial Grid:

```
[5][3][8][1][4]
[7][2][6][9][5]
[4][7][1][3][8]
[6][5][2][7][9]
[1][8][4][6][2]
```

## Game Components

- **Number Grid**: A 5x5 two-dimensional array representing the game board.
  - **Cells**: Each cell contains an integer between 1 and 9.
  - **Status**: Cells can be either "available" or "selected".
- **Player Scores**: Numerical values representing each player's total accumulated from selected numbers.
- **Cursor**: Indicates the last selected cell, determining valid moves for the next player.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Actions per Turn**:
  1. **Selection**: Choose an available number from the grid.
  2. **Validation**: Ensure the selected number is a valid move based on the adjacency rule.
  3. **Scoring**: Add the selected number to the player's total score.
  4. **Update Grid**: Mark the selected cell as "selected" and display the updated grid.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **First Move**:
   - The first player can select any number from the grid.
2. **Adjacency Rule**:
   - Each subsequent move must be an available number that is orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to the last number selected by the opponent.
   - Diagonal moves are not allowed.
3. **Valid Moves**:
   - If a player has no valid moves (no adjacent available numbers), they skip their turn.
4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends when both players have no valid moves remaining.
5. **No Draws**:
   - Since the grid has a finite number of cells and selections, the game will always end with one player having a higher score.

## Scoring

- **Score Tracking**:
  - Each player's score is the sum of the numbers they have selected during the game.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player with the higher total score at the end of the game is declared the winner.

## Examples

### Sample Turns

**Initial Grid**:

```
[5][3][8][1][4]

[4][7][1][3][8]
[6][5][2][7][9]
[1][8][4][6][2]
```

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Action**: Selects `[6]` at position (3,0).
- **Score Update**: Player 1's score is now 6.
- **Grid Update**:

```
[5][3][8][1][4]
[7][2][6][9][5]
[4][7][1][3][8]
[ ][5][2][7][9]
[1][8][4][6][2]
```

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Available Moves**: Must select an available number adjacent to position (3,0).
- **Adjacency Options**:
  - (2,0): `[4]`
  - (4,0): `[1]`
  - (3,1): `[5]`
- **Action**: Selects `[5]` at position (3,1).
- **Score Update**: Player 2's score is now 5.
- **Grid Update**:

```
[5][3][8][1][4]
[7][2][6][9][5]
[4][7][1][3][8]
[ ][ ][2][7][9]
[1][8][4][6][2]
```

**Player 1's Next Turn**:
- **Available Moves**: Must select an available number adjacent to position (3,1).
- **Adjacency Options**:
  - (2,1): `[7]`
  - (4,1): `[8]`
  - (3,2): `[2]`
- **Action**: Selects `[8]` at position (4,1).
- **Score Update**: Player 1's score is now 14 (6 + 8).
- **Grid Update**:

```
[5][3][8][1][4]
[7][2][6][9][5]
[4][7][1][3][8]
[ ][ ][2][7][9]
[1][ ][4][6][2]
```

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Prompt**: "Player 1, enter the coordinates of your selected number (row, column):"
- **Input**: `3,0`
- **Output**: "You selected [6] at position (3,0). Your score is now 6."

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Prompt**: "Player 2, select an adjacent number to the last selection at (3,0):"
- **Input**: `3,1`
- **Output**: "You selected [5] at position (3,1). Your score is now 5."

**Game End Announcement**:
- **Output**: "No more valid moves. Game over!"
- **Final Scores**:
  - Player 1: 14
  - Player 2: 5
- **Winner**: "Player 1 wins!"

## Additional Notes

- **Strategic Depth**:
  - Players must plan ahead to maximize their score while minimizing the opponent's options.
  - Selecting high-value numbers might open access to even higher numbers for the opponent.
- **Replayability**:
  - The random generation of the grid ensures that each game is unique.
- **Ease of Coding**:
  - The game mechanics are straightforward, suitable for implementation in a command-line interface.
  - Can be programmed using basic data structures like arrays or lists.

## Summary

Number Nexus is a fast-paced, strategic game that combines numerical strategy with spatial awareness. Its simple rules and quick gameplay make it easy to learn but challenging to master, providing an engaging experience where skillful play is rewarded.
