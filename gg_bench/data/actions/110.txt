In the gym environment code for the "Target Number" game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 actions, corresponding to numbers 1 through 9. Each action index (0-8) maps directly to a number, such that:

- Action index 0 corresponds to selecting number 1
- Action index 1 corresponds to selecting number 2
- ...
- Action index 8 corresponds to selecting number 9

When a player selects an action, the chosen action index is transformed to the actual number by adding 1 to the index. Thus, the action index acts as an offset in this mapping.
