# Prime Sum Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to collect **exactly three prime numbers** that **sum up to the target number**. Victory is achieved by strategically selecting prime numbers to match the target sum before your opponent does.

---

## Setup

1. **Select Target Sum**:
   - At the start of the game, a **target sum** is randomly selected between **20** and **40** (inclusive).
   - Example: Target Sum = **30**.

2. **Number Pool**:
   - The game uses numbers from **2** to **19** (inclusive).
   - Both prime and non-prime numbers are available for selection.

3. **Player Collections**:
   - Each player has a personal collection to hold their selected prime numbers.
   - A maximum of **three prime numbers** can be held in a player's collection at any time.

---

## Game Components

- **Target Sum**: A randomly chosen number between **20** and **40**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers ranging from **2** to **19**.
- **Player Collections**: Holds selected prime numbers, up to a maximum of three per player.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players take turns alternatively.
  - Determine the first player randomly or by mutual agreement.

- **Turn Actions**:
  - On your turn, **select one number** from the number pool.

- **Selection Outcomes**:
  - If the number is **prime**:
    - **Add** it to your collection.
    - Once added, a number **cannot be removed** from your collection.
  - If the number is **not prime**:
    - It is **discarded**, and the turn passes to the opponent.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - You **must select** a number on your turn; skipping is not allowed.
   - Numbers can be selected **multiple times** by either player.

2. **Building Your Collection**:
   - You can only hold up to **three prime numbers** in your collection.
   - Once you have **three primes**, you cannot select more numbers.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Win** by having your three prime numbers **sum exactly** to the target sum.
   - If your three primes **do not sum** to the target, you **lose** immediately upon collecting the third prime.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If your three primes **exceed** or **do not match** the target sum, you lose.
   - If both players end up losing, the player whose sum is **closer** to the target sum wins.
   - In the event of a tie in closeness, the player who reached their sum **first** wins.

5. **Opponent Interaction**:
   - Since both players can select the same numbers, strategic blocking is possible.
   - Pay attention to the opponentâ€™s selections to anticipate their potential sums.

6. **Game End Conditions**:
   - A player wins immediately upon achieving a correct sum.
   - A player loses immediately upon reaching three primes that do not sum to the target.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - Achieved by being the **first** to collect three prime numbers that **sum exactly** to the target sum.

- **Defeat**:
  - Occurs if your collection of three primes **does not sum** to the target.

- **Tie-Breaker**:
  - If both players fail to meet the target sum:
    - The player whose sum is **closer** to the target wins.
    - If both are equally close, the player who assembled their collection **first** wins.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Target Sum**: 30

**Player 1's Collection** | **Sum** | **Player 2's Collection** | **Sum**
--- | --- | --- | ---
7 | 7 | 11 | 11
7, 13 | 20 | 11, 17 | 28
7, 13, 2 | 22 | 11, 17, 2 | **30**

- **Outcome**:
  - **Player 2** wins by achieving the target sum of **30** with primes **11, 17, 2**.

### Sample Turn-by-Turn Interaction

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **7**.
   - **7** is prime. Collection: `[7]`.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Selects **11**.
   - **11** is prime. Collection: `[11]`.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **13**.
   - **13** is prime. Collection: `[7, 13]`.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Selects **17**.
   - **17** is prime. Collection: `[11, 17]`.

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Selects **2**.
   - **2** is prime. Collection: `[7, 13, 2]`.
   - Sum is **22**. Does not equal target sum. Player 1 must wait for Player 2's turn.

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Selects **2**.
   - **2** is prime. Collection: `[11, 17, 2]`.
   - Sum is **30**. Equals target sum.
   - **Player 2 wins**.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Blocking**:
  - Anticipate which primes your opponent needs and select them first.

- **Sum Planning**:
  - Calculate potential sums before selecting a prime to avoid immediate loss.

- **Risk Management**:
  - If forced to choose a third prime that overshoots the target, consider choosing a smaller prime or one that may prevent the opponent from winning.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
[Game Start]
Target Sum is randomly selected: 31

Player 1's Turn:
Select a number between 2 and 19: 13
13 is a prime number. Added to your collection: [13]

Player 2's Turn:
Select a number between 2 and 19: 11
11 is a prime number. Added to your collection: [11]

Player 1's Turn:
Select a number between 2 and 19: 17
17 is a prime number. Added to your collection: [13, 17]

Player 2's Turn:
Select a number between 2 and 19: 7
7 is a prime number. Added to your collection: [11, 7]

Player 1's Turn:
Select a number between 2 and 19: 19
19 is a prime number. Added to your collection: [13, 17, 19]
Your sum is 49, which does not equal the target sum.
You have exceeded the target sum. You lose.

Player 2 wins!
```
