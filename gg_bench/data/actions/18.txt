In the gym environment for Gridlock Showdown, the action space indices (0-15) directly map to the cells on the 4x4 grid. Each index corresponds to a specific cell in row-major order, where indices 0-3 map to the cells in the first row, indices 4-7 to the second row, indices 8-11 to the third row, and indices 12-15 to the fourth row. This mapping allows players to specify their move by selecting the index that corresponds to the cell they wish to claim on the grid.
