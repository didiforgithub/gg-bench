The action space indices (0 to 8) in the gym environment code correspond to selecting numbers from 1 to 9 in the game. Each index maps directly to a number by adding 1, so index 0 selects the number 1, index 1 selects the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 which selects the number 9. This simple mapping allows each possible action to represent a unique number choice from the number pool.
