In the GridLock gym environment, each action is represented by an index from 0 to 31, corresponding to a combination of a move and a block direction. The action index is split into two components: the move direction and the block direction. 

- The **move direction** is determined by integer division of the action index by 8 (`action // 8`), resulting in a value from 0 to 3, which maps to the four orthogonally adjacent directions:
  - 0: Up (-1, 0)
  - 1: Down (1, 0)
  - 2: Left (0, -1)
  - 3: Right (0, 1)

- The **block direction** is determined by the modulus operation of the action index by 8 (`action % 8`), resulting in a value from 0 to 7, which maps to the eight surrounding directions:
  - 0: Upper left (-1, -1)
  - 1: Up (-1, 0)
  - 2: Upper right (-1, 1)
  - 3: Left (0, -1)
  - 4: Right (0, 1)
  - 5: Lower left (1, -1)
  - 6: Down (1, 0)
  - 7: Lower right (1, 1)

Thus, an action index represents a unique combination of moving the player's token in one of the four directions and then blocking a cell in one of the eight directions from the new position.
