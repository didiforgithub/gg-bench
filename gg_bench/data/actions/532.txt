In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for the game "Grid Conquest," the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(25)`, which represents the 25 possible cells in the 5x5 grid. Each action index corresponds to a specific cell on the grid, mapped sequentially from top-left to bottom-right. The index-to-cell mapping is as follows:

- Index `0` corresponds to cell `A1`,
- Index `1` to cell `A2`,
- ...
- Index `4` to cell `A5`,
- Index `5` to cell `B1`,
- and so on until,
- Index `24` corresponds to cell `E5`.

An action index `n` is translated to the grid coordinates `(i, j)` using the calculations:
- Row index `i = n // 5` (integer division),
- Column index `j = n % 5` (remainder).

This allows players to select cells by performing actions indexed from 0 to 24, aligning each action to a specific cell on the grid.
