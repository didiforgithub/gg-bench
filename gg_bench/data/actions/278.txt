In the custom gym environment for the "Sequence Spot" game, the action space comprises indices 0 through 8, each corresponding to a move on the 3x3 grid. The grid cells are indexed row-wise from 0 to 8 as follows:

- Index 0: Top-left cell (row 1, column 1)
- Index 1: Top-middle cell (row 1, column 2)
- Index 2: Top-right cell (row 1, column 3)
- Index 3: Middle-left cell (row 2, column 1)
- Index 4: Center cell (row 2, column 2)
- Index 5: Middle-right cell (row 2, column 3)
- Index 6: Bottom-left cell (row 3, column 1)
- Index 7: Bottom-middle cell (row 3, column 2)
- Index 8: Bottom-right cell (row 3, column 3)

The action chosen by a player corresponds to placing their marker in the respective indexed cell, if unmarked.
