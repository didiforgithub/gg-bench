# Prime Time: A Two-Player Strategic Number Game

## Objective

Be the first player to accumulate a total sum of prime numbers that exceeds **50**. Strategic selection of prime numbers will help you reach the goal while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Starting Condition**: Both players start with a total sum of **0**.
- **Number Pool**: A shared pool of prime numbers from **2** to **29**.

## Game Components

- **Prime Number Tokens**: Numbers representing prime numbers between **2** and **29** inclusive. The primes are: **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29**.
  - Each prime number is available as a single token in the shared pool.
  - **Appearance**: Each token displays the prime number it represents.
  - **Functionality**: Tokens are selected by players to add to their total sum.
  
## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.
- **On Your Turn**:
  - **Select a Prime Number Token** from the shared pool.
  - **Add the Selected Prime** to your total sum.
  - The selected prime number is **removed** from the shared pool and is **no longer available** for selection.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After a player completes their turn, the next player takes their turn following the same rules.
  
## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Prime Selection**:
   - Only prime numbers from the shared pool can be selected.
   - Each prime number can be selected **only once** during the game.
2. **Accumulating Sum**:
   - Players keep a **running total** of the prime numbers they have selected.
   - The total sum is updated each turn by adding the newly selected prime number.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a **total sum greater than 50** wins the game immediately.
4. **End of Game Conditions**:
   - If all prime numbers have been selected and **no player has exceeded a total sum of 50**, the player with the **higher total sum** wins.
   - In the event of both players having **equal total sums** after all primes are selected without exceeding 50, the last player to have taken a turn **loses**. (This ensures there is **no draw**.)
5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players must plan their selections to maximize their total while limiting the options available to their opponent.
   - Being attentive to the remaining primes and the opponent's total sum is crucial.

## Scoring

- **Total Sum Tracking**:
  - Each player's score is the **sum of their selected prime numbers**.
  - Scores are updated and announced after each turn.
- **Winning Score**:
  - Exceeding a total sum of **50** points results in an immediate win.

## Strategic Tips

- **Monitor Totals**: Keep track of both your and your opponent's total sums to inform your strategy.
- **Prime Selection**: Opt for larger primes early to quickly increase your total, but be cautious of overshooting 50 without securing a win.
- **Blocking Strategy**: Anticipate which primes your opponent may need and select those to limit their options.
- **Counting Ahead**: Calculate possible sums remaining with the available primes to plan your moves effectively.
