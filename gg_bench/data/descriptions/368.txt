# Switch and Capture: Rule Book

## Objective

**Be the last player able to make a legal move.**

In "Switch and Capture," two players compete to outmaneuver each other by toggling switches according to specific rules. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a legal move on their turn, thereby securing your victory.

---

## Setup

- **Switches Row:** A row of **10 switches**, numbered from **1** to **10**, is initialized.
- **Initial State:** All switches start in the **OFF** position.
- **Player Positions:** Players decide who will take the **first turn** (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
- **Starting Conditions:** No switches are toggled; the game begins with all switches OFF.

---

## Game Components

1. **Switches:**
   - **Quantity:** 10 switches.
   - **Numbering:** Each switch is uniquely identified by a number from **1** to **10**.
   - **States:**
     - **OFF Position:** The default state at the start of the game.
     - **ON Position:** Switches toggled by players during the game.
   - **Functionality:** Toggling switches affects their state and potentially others, based on the rules.

2. **Player Symbols:**
   - While not necessary, players may be represented by symbols or initials in the command-line interface for clarity.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with the player who was chosen to go first.
- **Actions During a Turn:**
  1. **Select a Switch to Toggle ON:**
     - The player chooses a switch that is currently in the **OFF** position.
     - The chosen switch must be toggled to the **ON** position.
  2. **Toggle Affected Switches:**
     - After toggling the chosen switch to ON, the player must toggle all other switches whose numbers are **factors or multiples** of the chosen switch's number.
     - **Affected switches** change state (ON becomes OFF; OFF becomes ON).
- **Turn Progression:**
  - Once all required switches have been toggled, the turn passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Legal Moves:**
   - A player **must** toggle at least one switch to the **ON** position during their turn.
   - Only switches in the **OFF** position can be toggled to ON.
2. **Toggling Mechanism:**
   - **Chosen Switch:**
     - Toggle the selected switch from OFF to ON.
   - **Affected Switches:**
     - Identify all switches whose numbers are **factors or multiples** of the chosen switch's number (excluding the chosen switch itself).
     - Toggle the state of each affected switch (ON becomes OFF; OFF becomes ON).
3. **Factors and Multiples:**
   - A **factor** of a number is an integer that divides evenly into that number.
     - Example: Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
   - A **multiple** of a number is the product of that number and an integer.
     - Example: Multiples of 2 up to 10 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
4. **End of the Game:**
   - The game ends when a player **cannot make a legal move** on their turn (i.e., there are no switches in the OFF position that can be toggled ON).
   - The **last player** who made a legal move is declared the **winner**.
5. **Forbidden Moves:**
   - A player **cannot pass** their turn if a legal move is available.
   - A player **cannot** toggle a switch that is already in the **ON** position to ON again.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition:**
  - Winning is achieved by being the **last player able to make a legal move**.
- **No Points System:**
  - There is no point accumulation or scoring beyond determining the winner.
- **Tracking Game State:**
  - The current state of all switches (ON or OFF) should be displayed after each turn to keep players informed.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

Let's illustrate a sample game between **Player A** and **Player B**.

#### Initial State:

Switches 1 to 10 are all OFF.

```
Switches:
1[OFF] 2[OFF] 3[OFF] 4[OFF] 5[OFF] 6[OFF] 7[OFF] 8[OFF] 9[OFF] 10[OFF]
```

#### Turn 1: Player A

- **Chooses Switch 7** to toggle ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Since 7 has no factors or multiples within 1-10 other than 7 itself, **no other switches are toggled**.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[OFF] 2[OFF] 3[OFF] 4[OFF] 5[OFF] 6[OFF] 7[ON] 8[OFF] 9[OFF] 10[OFF]
```

#### Turn 2: Player B

- **Chooses Switch 2** to toggle ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Switches that are multiples or factors of 2 (excluding 2):
  - **Switch 4** (2 x 2)
  - **Switch 6** (2 x 3)
  - **Switch 8** (2 x 4)
  - **Switch 10** (2 x 5)
- **Toggles Switches 4, 6, 8, and 10**.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[OFF] 2[ON] 3[OFF] 4[ON] 5[OFF] 6[ON] 7[ON] 8[ON] 9[OFF] 10[ON]
```

#### Turn 3: Player A

- **Chooses Switch 5** to toggle ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Switches that are multiples or factors of 5 (excluding 5):
  - **Switch 10** (5 x 2)
- **Toggles Switch 10**.
- **Switch 10** changes from ON to **OFF**.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[OFF] 2[ON] 3[OFF] 4[ON] 5[ON] 6[ON] 7[ON] 8[ON] 9[OFF] 10[OFF]
```

#### Turn 4: Player B

- **Chooses Switch 6**. However, Switch 6 is already ON.
- **Available OFF switches:** 1, 3, 9, 10.
- **Chooses Switch 9** to toggle ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Switch 9 has factors/multiples:
  - **Switch 3** (3 x 3 = 9)
- **Toggles Switch 3**.
- **Switch 3** changes from OFF to **ON**.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[OFF] 2[ON] 3[ON] 4[ON] 5[ON] 6[ON] 7[ON] 8[ON] 9[ON] 10[OFF]
```

#### Turn 5: Player A

- **Available OFF switches:** 1 and 10.
- **Chooses Switch 1** to toggle ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Switches that are factors or multiples of 1 (excluding 1):
  - **Switches 2 to 10** (since 1 is a factor of all numbers)
- **Toggles Switches 2 to 10**:
  - Switches currently ON (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) change to OFF.
  - Switch 10 (currently OFF) changes to ON.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[ON] 2[OFF] 3[OFF] 4[OFF] 5[OFF] 6[OFF] 7[OFF] 8[OFF] 9[OFF] 10[ON]
```

#### Turn 6: Player B

- **Available OFF switches:** 2 to 9.
- **Chooses Switch 2** to toggle ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Switches that are factors or multiples of 2 (excluding 2):
  - **Switch 4**, **6**, **8**, and **10**.
- **Toggles Switches 4, 6, 8, 10**:
  - Switches 4, 6, 8 (currently OFF) change to ON.
  - Switch 10 (currently ON) changes to OFF.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[ON] 2[ON] 3[OFF] 4[ON] 5[OFF] 6[ON] 7[OFF] 8[ON] 9[OFF] 10[OFF]
```

#### Turns Continue...

Players continue taking turns following the rules.

#### End Game Scenario:

Assuming the game progresses and only Switch 5 is left in the OFF position on Player A's turn.

- **Player A** toggles Switch 5 ON.
- **Affected Switches:** Switch 10 (multiple of 5).
- **Switch 10** toggles from OFF to ON.
- **Resulting State:**

```
Switches:
1[ON] 2[ON] 3[ON] 4[ON] 5[ON] 6[ON] 7[ON] 8[ON] 9[ON] 10[ON]
```

- **Player B's Turn:**
  - All switches are now ON.
  - **No legal moves available**.
  - **Player B loses**.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a simple command-line interface where players input switch numbers to toggle.

### Game Start:

```
Welcome to Switch and Capture!

All switches are OFF:
1[OFF] 2[OFF] 3[OFF] 4[OFF] 5[OFF] 6[OFF] 7[OFF] 8[OFF] 9[OFF] 10[OFF]

Player A, it's your turn.
Enter the number of the switch you want to toggle ON: 7
```

### After Player A's Turn:

```
You toggled Switch 7 ON.
No other switches were affected.

Current Switch States:
1[OFF] 2[OFF] 3[OFF] 4[OFF] 5[OFF] 6[OFF] 7[ON] 8[OFF] 9[OFF] 10[OFF]

Player B, it's your turn.
Enter the number of the switch you want to toggle ON: 2
```

### After Player B's Turn:

```
You toggled Switch 2 ON.
Affected switches toggled:
Switch 4 toggled to ON.
Switch 6 toggled to ON.
Switch 8 toggled to ON.
Switch 10 toggled to ON.

Current Switch States:
1[OFF] 2[ON] 3[OFF] 4[ON] 5[OFF] 6[ON] 7[ON] 8[ON] 9[OFF] 10[ON]

Player A, it's your turn.
Enter the number of the switch you want to toggle ON: 5
```

### Game Continues...

Players continue to input their moves, and the command-line interface updates the switch states accordingly after each turn.
