In the provided gym environment for the "Digit Removal Duel" game, the action space is defined as 18 discrete actions, each corresponding to removing one or more consecutive digits from either the start or the end of the current number (N):

- **Actions 0 to 8**: Each action corresponds to removing (action + 1) digits from the start of the number. For example, action 0 removes 1 digit from the start, action 1 removes 2 digits, and so on up to action 8, which removes 9 digits.
  
- **Actions 9 to 17**: Each action corresponds to removing (action - 9 + 1) digits from the end of the number. For example, action 9 removes 1 digit from the end, action 10 removes 2 digits, and so on up to action 17, which removes 9 digits.
