In the Cipher Shift game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with a size equal to the length of the target word. Each action corresponds to an index position in the current word. When a player selects an action, they increment the letter at the specified index position by one in the alphabet, wrapping around from 'Z' back to 'A' if needed. Thus, each index in the action space directly maps to and allows the modification of a specific position in the current word, allowing players to strategically choose which letter to advance towards matching the target word.
