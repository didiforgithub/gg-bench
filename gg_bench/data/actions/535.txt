The action space indices in the game are mapped to specific game moves as follows:

1. **Indices 0 to 319**: Each index corresponds to placing a tile at a specific position in the equation space. The formula to calculate these indices is `tile_index * max_eq_length + position`, where `tile_index` identifies the specific tile (numbers 0-10 and operators 11-15), and `position` denotes the location in the equation space (ranging from 0 to 19).

2. **Index 320**: This index corresponds to the rearrangement action, allowing the player to rearrange tiles in the equation space.

3. **Index 321**: This index corresponds to the end-turn action, allowing the player to end their turn. However, it is only valid if the player has placed at least one new tile during that turn.
