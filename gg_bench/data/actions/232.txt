In the game, the action space is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 48, which translate into specific moves:

1. **Indices 0-45**: These represent mirror placements. The grid positions (excluding bases) are enumerated, and each position can have two orientations:
   - An index is calculated by `(position_index * 2) + orientation`, where `position_index` is a valid position index on the grid, and `orientation` is 0 for `/` or 1 for `\`.

2. **Indices 46-48**: These correspond to rotating an existing mirror of the current player. Each index directly relates to rotating one of the player's mirrors, with 46 being the first mirror, 47 the second, and 48 the third.
