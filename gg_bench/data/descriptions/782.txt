# Predictive Pursuit

## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Be the first player to reach position **10** on a linear track by outmaneuvering your opponent through strategic decision-making and prediction.

**Victory Condition**: A player wins by advancing their token to exactly position **10** before their opponent does. There are no draws; the game continues until one player achieves this objective.

---

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: Conceptualize a linear track with positions numbered from **0** to **10**.

2. **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token that starts at position **0** on the track.

3. **Starting Conditions**: Decide which player goes first through mutual agreement or a simple random method like flipping a coin.

---

## Game Components

- **Tokens**: Represented in the command-line interface by each player's initials or a designated character (e.g., `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2).

- **Track Positions**: Numerical positions from **0** (start) to **10** (finish). The track is conceptual and displayed as numerical values updated each turn.

- **Moves**: Players secretly choose to move **1** or **2** steps forward during their turn.

---

## Turns

1. **Secret Move Selection**: On each turn, the active player secretly selects to move **1** or **2** steps forward without revealing this choice to the opponent.

2. **Opponent's Guess**: The opponent attempts to predict the active player's chosen move by guessing **1** or **2**.

3. **Movement Resolution**:

   - **Correct Guess**: If the opponent guesses correctly, the active player's token does **not** move.
   
   - **Incorrect Guess**: If the opponent guesses incorrectly, the active player's token moves forward by the number of steps they secretly selected.

4. **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns, repeating the above steps until one player's token reaches position **10**.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Movement Constraints**:

  - A player cannot move beyond position **10**. If a move would place the token past position **10**, that move is invalid, and the player must choose a lesser move if possible.
  
- **Secret Selection Method**:

  - Each player inputs their secret move into the command-line interface without the opponent seeing (e.g., by having the opponent look away or using separate input methods).
  
- **Guessing Mechanism**:

  - The opponent verbally announces their guess after the active player has made their secret selection.

- **Turn Example**:

  1. **Player 1's Turn**:

     - Secretly selects to move **2** steps.
     
     - Player 2 guesses **1**.
     
     - Since the guess is incorrect, Player 1 moves forward **2** steps to position **2**.
     
  2. **Player 2's Turn**:

     - Secretly selects to move **1** step.
     
     - Player 1 guesses **1**.
     
     - Guess is correct; Player 2 does not move.

---

## Scoring

- **Progress Tracking**:

  - Each player's current position is tracked and displayed after each turn.

- **Winning the Game**:

  - The first player to reach position **10** exactly is declared the winner.

- **No Draws**:

  - The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player wins.
