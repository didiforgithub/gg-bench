# Rule Book for "Grid Lock"

---

## Objective

The objective of **Grid Lock** is to immobilize your opponent's token by strategically moving your own token and placing walls on the grid. A player wins by trapping the opponent's token such that it cannot make any legal moves on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Game Grid:**
   - The game is played on a square grid of size **5x5**.
   - The grid cells are identified by their coordinates `(x, y)`, where `x` (row) and `y` (column) range from **1 to 5**.

2. **Token Placement:**
   - Each player has a unique token:
     - **Player 1:** `X`
     - **Player 2:** `O`
   - Players decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - **Player 1** places their token on any empty cell on the grid.
   - **Player 2** then places their token on any other empty cell.
   - Tokens cannot be placed on the same cell.

---

## Game Components

1. **Game Grid:**
   - A 5x5 grid representing the playing area.
   - Cells are marked as empty `.` unless occupied by a token or a wall.

2. **Player Tokens:**
   - **Player 1 Token (`X`):** Represents Player 1's position on the grid.
   - **Player 2 Token (`O`):** Represents Player 2's position on the grid.

3. **Walls (`#`):**
   - Obstacles that can be placed on the grid to block movement.
   - Once placed, walls remain fixed for the rest of the game.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- On each turn, a player must choose **one** of the following actions:
  1. **Move Token:**
     - Move your token to an adjacent empty cell (up, down, left, or right).
  2. **Place Wall:**
     - Place a wall on any empty cell on the grid.

- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Action Selection:**
     - Choose to move your token or place a wall.
  2. **Execution:**
     - Perform the chosen action.
  3. **Turn End:**
     - Pass the turn to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Adjacency:**
  - Tokens can move to any of the four adjacent cells (no diagonal movements).
- **Legal Moves:**
  - A move is legal if:
    - The destination cell is within the grid bounds.
    - The destination cell is empty (not occupied by a token or a wall).
- **Restrictions:**
  - Tokens cannot move onto or over walls.
  - Tokens cannot occupy the same cell as another token.

### Wall Placement Rules

- **Placement:**
  - Walls can be placed on any empty cell on the grid.
- **Permanence:**
  - Once placed, walls cannot be moved or removed.
- **Restrictions:**
  - Walls cannot be placed on cells occupied by tokens.
  - There is no limit to the number of walls a player can place during the game (one per turn).

### Winning the Game

- **Objective Fulfillment:**
  - A player wins if the opponent's token cannot make any legal moves on their turn.
- **No Draws:**
  - The game cannot end in a draw.
- **Game End:**
  - The game ends immediately when a player achieves the objective.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Blocked Cells:**
  - The edges of the grid act as walls; tokens cannot move beyond the grid boundaries.
- **Turn Timing:**
  - Players must complete their turn within a reasonable time frame to keep the game flowing.

## Strategy Tips

- **Balance Offense and Defense:**
  - Decide when to move towards your opponent versus when to place walls to block them.
- **Control the Center:**
  - Occupying central positions can give you more options to move and place walls effectively.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves:**
  - Anticipate where your opponent might move and plan your wall placements accordingly.
- **Avoid Self-Trapping:**
   - Be cautious not to limit your own movement while trying to trap your opponent.
- **Resource Management:**
   - Since walls are unlimited, focus on strategic placement rather than quantity.
