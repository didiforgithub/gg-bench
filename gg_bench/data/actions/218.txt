In the provided gym environment for the game Prime Duel, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, where actions are represented by indices from 0 to 9. Each index in this action space maps directly to a move in the game by selecting a number from 1 to 10, respectively. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to action index 9, which corresponds to selecting the number 10.
