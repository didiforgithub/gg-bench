In the game environment, each action corresponds to selecting a number from the available set. Specifically, the action space consists of indices 0 through 8, where each index maps directly to choosing the number `index + 1`. For instance, action 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action 1 to selecting number 2, and so on, up to action 8, which corresponds to selecting number 9. This mapping is how the actions translate to actual moves within the game.
