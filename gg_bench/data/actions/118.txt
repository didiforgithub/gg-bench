The action space indices (0 to 17) map to the moves in the game as follows:

- **Indices 0 to 8:** Correspond to "Attack" actions. Each index represents an attack using a number from 1 to 9. For example, index 0 means attack with the number 1, index 1 means attack with the number 2, and so on up to index 8, which means attack with the number 9.

- **Indices 9 to 17:** Correspond to "Defend" actions. Each index represents a defense using a number from 1 to 9. For example, index 9 means defend with the number 1, index 10 means defend with the number 2, and so on up to index 17, which means defend with the number 9.
