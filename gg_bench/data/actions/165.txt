In the given gym environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 15, corresponding to selecting a number from a 4x4 grid filled with numbers 1 through 16. Each index directly represents a cell in the grid, where index 0 corresponds to the top-left cell, index 1 to the next cell to the right, proceeding row by row to index 15, which represents the bottom-right cell. Selecting an action index allows the player to choose the respective number from the grid to subtract from their opponent's score, provided it is a valid move.
