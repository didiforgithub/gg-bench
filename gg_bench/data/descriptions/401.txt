# **Reduction Clash**

## **Objective**

Be the player to reduce the shared starting number to **1** according to the game's rules. Victory is achieved by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## **Setup**

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared number, **100**.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Initial Conditions**: No pieces, tokens, or additional components are needed.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Shared Number**: A positive integer that both players will manipulate during the game. Initially set to **100**.
- **Divisors**: Numbers greater than **1** and less than the current shared number that divide it evenly (without leaving a remainder).
- **Calculator or Paper (Optional)**: For ease of calculation, though not necessary if players can compute mentally.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Determine First Player**: Players can flip a coin, roll a die, or agree on who will start.
2. **Alternate Turns**: Players take turns making a move.
3. **Turn Actions**:
   - **Select Divisor**: On your turn, choose a valid divisor of the current number.
   - **Divide**: Divide the current number by the chosen divisor.
   - **Announce New Number**: State the new current number after division.
4. **Turn Progression**: The new current number becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Divisors**:
   - Must be a **proper divisor** of the current number (greater than **1** and less than the current number).
   - Must **evenly divide** the current number (no remainders).
2. **Making a Move**:
   - If multiple valid divisors exist, you may choose any of them.
   - If no valid divisors exist (the current number is prime or **1**), you cannot make a move.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If you reduce the current number to **1** on your turn, you **win** the game.
   - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you **win**.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn, you **lose** the game.
5. **Restrictions**:
   - **Do not** use divisors less than **2**.
   - **Do not** subtract or perform any operation other than division as specified.

## **Scoring**

- The game does not involve a scoring system.
- Victory is determined by strategic play leading to a win condition as described in the rules.

## **Example Gameplay**

### **Example 1**

- **Starting Number**: 100

#### **Player 1's Turn**

1. **Current Number**: 100
2. **Valid Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
3. **Action**: Chooses divisor **25**
4. **Calculation**: 100 รท 25 = **4**
5. **Announces**: "The new number is 4."

#### **Player 2's Turn**

1. **Current Number**: 4
2. **Valid Divisors**: 2
3. **Action**: Chooses divisor **2**
4. **Calculation**: 4 รท 2 = **2**
5. **Announces**: "The new number is 2."

#### **Player 1's Turn**

1. **Current Number**: 2
2. **Valid Divisors**: None (2 is prime)
3. **Outcome**: Cannot make a move.
4. **Result**: **Player 1 loses**, **Player 2 wins**.

### **Example 2**

- **Starting Number**: 100

#### **Player 1's Turn**

1. **Current Number**: 100
2. **Valid Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
3. **Action**: Chooses divisor **4**
4. **Calculation**: 100 รท 4 = **25**
5. **Announces**: "The new number is 25."

#### **Player 2's Turn**

1. **Current Number**: 25
2. **Valid Divisors**: 5
3. **Action**: Chooses divisor **5**
4. **Calculation**: 25 รท 5 = **5**
5. **Announces**: "The new number is 5."

#### **Player 1's Turn**

1. **Current Number**: 5
2. **Valid Divisors**: None (5 is prime)
3. **Outcome**: Cannot make a move.
4. **Result**: **Player 1 loses**, **Player 2 wins**.

## **Sample Command-Line Interaction**

Below is a simulated command-line interaction between two players.

### **Game Start**

```
Game Start: The current number is 100.
```

### **Player 1's Turn**

```
Player 1's turn.
Valid divisors of 100: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50.
Enter your chosen divisor: 20
You chose 20.
Calculation: 100 / 20 = 5
The new number is 5.
```

### **Player 2's Turn**

```
Player 2's turn.
Valid divisors of 5: None.
Player 2 cannot make a move.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## **Strategy Tips**

- **Aim for Primes**: Try to leave your opponent with a prime number or **1**, forcing them into a position where they cannot move.
- **Control the Divisors**: Choose divisors that result in numbers with limited divisors for your opponent.
- **Think Ahead**: Anticipate the possible resulting numbers and plan your moves to guide the game towards a win.

## **Conclusion**

"Reduction Clash" is a simple yet strategic game that tests your numerical reasoning and foresight. By understanding the factors of numbers and anticipating your opponent's options, you can consistently outmaneuver less skilled players and secure a win.

Enjoy the challenge and have fun clashing!
