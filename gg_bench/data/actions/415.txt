In the gym environment for Divisor Duel, each index in the action space corresponds to a specific prime number from the generated list of primes up to `N_MAX`. When a player selects an action index, it maps directly to the prime divisor corresponding to that index in the list. The game checks if the chosen prime divides the current `N` without a remainder, validating the move. This mapping allows players to choose a valid prime divisor by selecting the index representing their desired move within the constraints of the predefined prime list.
