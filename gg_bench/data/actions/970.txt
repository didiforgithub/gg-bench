In the "Divisibility Duel" gym environment, the action space consists of discrete actions indexed from 0 to 8, corresponding directly to selecting one of the digits from 1 to 9 in the player's digit set. Specifically, action index 0 maps to using the digit 1, index 1 maps to using the digit 2, and so forth, up to index 8, which maps to using the digit 9. This mapping facilitates selecting a digit to multiply the current Shared Number on each player's turn.
