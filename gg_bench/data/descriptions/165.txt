**Subtraction Square**

---

**Objective**

The primary goal of Subtraction Square is to strategically reduce your opponent's score to exactly zero by selecting numbers from a shared grid. Each number chosen subtracts from the opponent's score. The player who successfully reduces their opponent's score to zero wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose.

**Setup**

1. **Grid Initialization**: Create a 4x4 grid filled with the numbers 1 through 16, randomly arranged.
   
2. **Player Scores**: Both players start with a score of **20**.

3. **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by random selection or mutual agreement).

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:

   - **Valid Moves**: On their turn, a player must select a number that does not reduce the opponent's score below zero.
   
   - **Invalid Moves**: If all remaining numbers would cause the opponent's score to become negative, the player cannot make a move and loses the game.

2. **Score Reduction**:

   - The selected number is subtracted from the opponent's score.
   
   - A player's score cannot go below zero.
   
   - Reaching exactly zero is the winning condition.

3. **Removing Numbers**:

   - Once a number is selected, it is removed from the grid and cannot be chosen again.
   
   - The grid updates after each turn to reflect the remaining available numbers.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - A player wins by reducing their opponent's score to exactly zero.
   
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose the game.

**Scoring**

- **Score Tracking**: Each player's score begins at 20 and decreases based on the numbers selected by the opponent.
  
- **Winning Condition**: Reduce your opponent's score to exactly zero to win.
  
- **Losing Condition**: Being unable to make a valid move on your turn results in a loss.
