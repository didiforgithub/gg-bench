# GridLock: A Two-Player Strategic Game

## Objective

GridLock is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a 5x5 grid. The primary goal is to immobilize your opponent by strategically moving your marker and placing blocks on the grid. A player wins by preventing the opponent from making any legal moves on their turn, effectively "locking" them in place.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid, represented as a matrix of cells.

2. **Player Markers**:
   - **Player 1** starts with their marker at the top-left corner of the grid (position (0, 0)).
   - **Player 2** starts with their marker at the bottom-right corner of the grid (position (4, 4)).

3. **Blocks**: Initially, all other cells on the grid are empty and available for movement or block placement.

## Game Components

- **Grid Cells**:
  - Represented by coordinates (row, column) ranging from (0, 0) to (4, 4).
  - Each cell can be in one of the following states:
    - **Empty**: Available for movement or block placement.
    - **Occupied by Player Marker**: Contains Player 1's marker (`P1`) or Player 2's marker (`P2`).
    - **Blocked**: Contains a block (`X`) and cannot be moved into or through.

- **Player Markers**:
  - **Player 1 Marker (`P1`)**: Represents Player 1's position on the grid.
  - **Player 2 Marker (`P2`)**: Represents Player 2's position on the grid.

- **Blocks (`X`)**:
  - Placed by players to obstruct the opponent's movement.
  - Once placed, blocks remain on the grid for the duration of the game.

## Turns

Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.

### On Each Turn, a Player Must:

1. **Move Their Marker**:
   - Move to an adjacent empty cell.
   - Movement can be **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right** (no diagonal moves).

2. **Place a Block**:
   - After moving, place a block (`X`) on any empty cell adjacent (including diagonally) to their **current** position.
   - Cannot place a block on a cell occupied by either player's marker or on a cell that already contains a block.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - A player must move their marker on their turn.
   - Markers cannot move into or through cells containing a block or the opponent's marker.
   - If a player has no legal moves at the start of their turn, they lose the game.

2. **Block Placement Rules**:
   - After moving, the player must place a block.
   - Blocks can only be placed on empty cells adjacent (including diagonally) to the player's **current** position.
   - Blocks are permanent and cannot be removed or moved once placed.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins when their opponent cannot make any legal moves on their turn.
   - If both players are unable to move on their respective turns, the player who moved last wins.

4. **No Passing or Skipping**:
   - Players cannot skip their move or block placement. Both actions are mandatory on each turn.

5. **Game End Conditions**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot move on their turn.
   - There are no draws; the game always results in a win for one player.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - The winning player is the one who successfully immobilizes their opponent.
  - There is no point-based scoring system; the game is won by strategic play leading to the opponent's inability to move.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Initial Grid State:

```
P1 .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  . P2
```

- `P1`: Player 1's marker starting at position (0, 0).
- `P2`: Player 2's marker starting at position (4, 4).
- `.`: Empty cells.

#### Turn 1: Player 1

1. **Move**:
   - Moves from (0, 0) to (0, 1).

2. **Place Block**:
   - Places a block at (0, 0).

#### Grid State:

```
X  P1 .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  . P2
```

#### Turn 2: Player 2

1. **Move**:
   - Moves from (4, 4) to (3, 4).

2. **Place Block**:
   - Places a block at (4, 4).

#### Grid State:

```
X  P1 .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  . P2
 .  .  .  . X
```

#### Turn 3: Player 1

1. **Move**:
   - Moves from (0, 1) to (1, 1).

2. **Place Block**:
   - Places a block at (0, 1).

#### Grid State:

```
X  X  .  .  .
 . P1 .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  .  . P2
 .  .  .  . X
```

#### Turn 4: Player 2

1. **Move**:
   - Moves from (3, 4) to (3, 3).

2. **Place Block**:
   - Places a block at (3, 4).

#### Grid State:

```
X  X  .  .  .
 . P1 .  .  .
 .  .  .  .  .
 .  .  . P2 X
 .  .  .  . X
```

#### Continuing the Game

Players continue moving and placing blocks, strategically trying to block the opponent's possible moves while keeping escape routes open for themselves.

#### Endgame Scenario

Assume after several turns, the grid looks like this:

```
X  X  X  X  X
X  P1 X  X  X
X  X  X  X  X
X  X  X P2 X
X  X  X  X  X
```

If it's **Player 2's** turn, and they have no adjacent empty cells to move into, **Player 1** wins.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

- "Enter move direction (up, down, left, right):"

**Player Input:**

- `right`

**Processing Move:**

- Player 1 moves from (0, 0) to (0, 1).

**Processing Block Placement:**

- A block is placed at (0, 0).

**Display Updated Grid:**

2 [ .  .  .  .  . ]
3 [ .  .  .  .  . ]
4 [ .  .  .  . P2]
```

### Subsequent Turns

Players continue in this fashion, with the system prompting for movement and block placement, updating and displaying the grid after each turn.

## Strategic Tips

- **Cut Off Routes**: Focus on placing blocks that limit your opponent's movement options without restricting your own.
- **Maintain Mobility**: Keep your marker towards the center of the grid to maximize escape routes.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Anticipate where your opponent might move next and place blocks to preemptively trap them.
- **Block Key Cells**: Identify and block cells that are crucial for your opponent's movement.

## Conclusion

GridLock is a simple yet strategically deep game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent. With straightforward rules and fast-paced gameplay, it's perfect for quick matches that test your tactical skills.

Enjoy the challenge, and may the best strategist win!
