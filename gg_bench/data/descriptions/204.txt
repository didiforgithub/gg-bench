# **Digit Poison**

## **Objective**

**Digit Poison** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players take turns adding digits to a shared number. The primary goal is to avoid being the player who creates a number divisible by a predetermined target divisor. The player who causes the shared number to be divisible by the target divisor loses the game.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Choose the Target Divisor:**
   - Before the game begins, both players agree on a target divisor (e.g., 3, 7, or 11).
   - The target divisor remains constant throughout the game.

2. **Initialize the Shared Number:**
   - The shared number starts as an empty string or zero length.

3. **Determine Player Order:**
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a simple method like a coin toss.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Digits (0-9):**
  - The available digits for selection are numerals **0** through **9**.
  - Each digit can be selected multiple times; there is no limit on how many times a digit can be used.

- **Shared Number:**
  - A concatenated sequence of digits chosen by both players during their turns.
  - The number grows longer with each turn as digits are added.
  - Example: If the sequence of chosen digits is 2, 5, 7, the shared number is 257.

- **Target Divisor:**
  - A positive integer agreed upon before the game starts.
  - Players aim to avoid creating a shared number divisible by this number.
  - Common choices are small primes or single-digit numbers for simplicity.

## **Turns**

### **Turn Structure**

1. **Digit Selection:**
   - The current player selects a single digit from **0** to **9**.

2. **Updating the Shared Number:**
   - The chosen digit is appended to the right end of the shared number.
   - Example: If the shared number is 34 and the player selects 7, the new shared number becomes 347.

3. **Divisibility Check:**
   - After updating, check if the new shared number is divisible by the target divisor.
   - If it **is divisible**, the current player **loses**.
   - If it **is not divisible**, the game continues, and the next player takes their turn.

4. **Turn Progression:**
   - Players alternate turns following the same structure until the game ends.

### **Actions During a Turn**

- **Mandatory Move:**
  - Players must select a digit on their turn; skipping a turn is not allowed.
  
- **No Changes to Previous Digits:**
  - Players cannot alter digits previously added to the shared number.

- **Time Limit (Optional):**
  - For added challenge, impose a reasonable time limit for each turn to encourage prompt play.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Divisibility Rules:**
   - **Player's Objective:**
     - Avoid creating a shared number that is divisible by the target divisor.
   - **Divisibility Detection:**
     - Use standard mathematical rules to determine divisibility.
     - Players may perform calculations mentally or use scratch paper.

2. **Winning and Losing Conditions:**
   - **Loss Condition:**
     - A player **loses** if they create a shared number divisible by the target divisor on their turn.
   - **No Draws:**
     - The game cannot end in a draw. If a maximum length is reached without a loss, the last player to move loses (see Maximum Length Rule).

3. **Maximum Length Rule (Optional):**
   - **Purpose:**
     - Prevent excessively long games and ensure a decisive outcome.
   - **Implementation:**
     - Agree upon a maximum number of digits (e.g., 10 digits).
     - If the shared number reaches this length without a player losing, the last player to add a digit loses the game.

4. **Validity of Moves:**
   - **Valid Moves:**
     - Any single digit from 0 to 9 can be chosen.
   - **Invalid Moves:**
     - Attempting to alter the shared number in ways other than appending a digit is invalid.

5. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Players should consider not only the immediate effect of their chosen digit but also anticipate potential future moves and how their opponent might respond.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition:**
  - The game is won by the player who **does not** create a shared number divisible by the target divisor.

- **No Point Tracking:**
  - There is no cumulative scoring system; each game is a standalone contest.

- **Match Play (Optional):**
  - Players can compete in multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game with Target Divisor 3**

#### **Game Start**

- **Target Divisor:** 3
- **Shared Number:** (empty)
- **Players:** Player 1 and Player 2

---

#### **Turn 1**

- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Selects digit **2**
- **Shared Number:** 2
- **Divisibility Check:**
  - 2 รท 3 = 0.666... (Not divisible)
- **Game Continues**

#### **Turn 2**

- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Selects digit **1**
- **Shared Number:** 21
- **Divisibility Check:**
  - 21 รท 3 = 7 (Divisible)
- **Outcome:**
  - **Player 2 loses**, **Player 1 wins**

**Explanation:**

- Player 2 added '1' creating '21', which is divisible by 3.

### **Example Game with Target Divisor 7**

#### **Game Start**

- **Target Divisor:** 7
- **Shared Number:** (empty)
- **Players:** Player 1 and Player 2

---

#### **Turn 1**

- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Selects digit **5**
- **Shared Number:** 5
- **Divisibility Check:**
  - 5 รท 7 = 0.714... (Not divisible)
- **Game Continues**

#### **Turn 2**

- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Selects digit **6**
- **Shared Number:** 56
- **Divisibility Check:**
  - 56 รท 7 = 8 (Divisible)
- **Outcome:**
  - **Player 2 loses**, **Player 1 wins**

**Explanation:**

- Player 2 added '6' creating '56', which is divisible by 7.

### **Turn 1**

```plaintext
Player 1's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 
Select a digit (0-9): 1
Updated Shared Number: 1
1 is not divisible by 5.
```

### **Turn 2**

```plaintext
Player 2's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 1
Select a digit (0-9): 2
Updated Shared Number: 12
12 is not divisible by 5.
```

### **Turn 3**

```plaintext
Player 1's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 12
Select a digit (0-9): 3
Updated Shared Number: 123
123 is not divisible by 5.
```

### **Turn 4**

```plaintext
Player 2's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 123
Select a digit (0-9): 5
Updated Shared Number: 1235
1235 is divisible by 5.
Player 2 loses!
Congratulations, Player 1 wins!
```

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Understanding Divisibility:**
  - For **divisor 3**: A number is divisible if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
  - For **divisor 5**: A number is divisible if it ends with 0 or 5.
  - For **divisor 7** and **11**: Utilize known divisibility rules or perform quick calculations.

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves:**
  - Consider how your chosen digit will set up the shared number for your opponent's next turn.

- **Control the Game Flow:**
  - Manipulate the shared number to force your opponent into a losing position.

## **Conclusion**

**Digit Poison** is a simple yet strategically rich game that tests numerical reasoning and foresight. It's quick to learn and ideal for play in a command-line interface, making it both accessible and engaging. Players must balance immediate safety with long-term strategy to outmaneuver their opponent and avoid the "poison" of creating a divisible number.

Enjoy the challenge and may the most cunning player win!
