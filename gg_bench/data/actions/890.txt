In the `Block Capture` game environment, the action space is defined as `Discrete(25)`, corresponding to the 5x5 grid positions. Each action space index (ranging from 0 to 24) directly maps to a specific position on the grid based on the formula:

- Row index: `action // 5`
- Column index: `action % 5`

This mapping allows each action index to represent a unique grid position. For example, action 0 maps to position (0,0) on the grid, action 1 to position (0,1), and so on, up to action 24, which maps to position (4,4). This strategy ensures that each action clearly corresponds to a distinct position on the board.
