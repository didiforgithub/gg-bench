The action space indices in the game are mapped to moves as follows:

- Indices `0` to `N-1` correspond to flipping a single `0` bit at positions `1` to `N`.
- Indices `N` to `2N-2` correspond to flipping two adjacent `0` bits at starting positions `1` to `N-1`.

For example, in a game with `N=10`, action `0` flips the bit at position `1`, action `9` flips the bit at position `10`, action `10` flips bits at positions `1` and `2`, and action `18` flips bits at positions `9` and `10`.
