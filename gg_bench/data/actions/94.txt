In the game environment, the action space indices `0` to `3` correspond to flipping the bit at positions `1` to `4` (left to right) in the binary number representation. Thus, action index `0` flips Bit 1, index `1` flips Bit 2, index `2` flips Bit 3, and index `3` flips Bit 4. This mapping aligns with the game's rule where players select a bit position (from `1` to `4`) to flip from `0` to `1`.
