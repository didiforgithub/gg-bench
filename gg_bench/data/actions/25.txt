The action space indices in the game map directly to specific number and operation combinations. There are a total of 18 indices, each representing a unique pair from the set of available numbers (1 to 9) and operations (addition `+` or multiplication `*`). The mapping is structured as follows: for each number `n` (e.g., 1, 2, ... 9), the first index maps to the addition operation, and the subsequent index maps to the multiplication operation. For instance, index 0 corresponds to using number 1 with addition, index 1 to number 1 with multiplication, index 2 to number 2 with addition, and so forth, continuing this alternating pattern through index 17, which corresponds to number 9 with multiplication.
