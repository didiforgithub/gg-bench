In the game environment, the action space indices correspond to the following actions:

- **Indices 0 to 3**: Represent movement actions for the current player's piece.
  - **0**: Move up (to the directly above cell).
  - **1**: Move down (to the directly below cell).
  - **2**: Move left (to the adjacent left cell).
  - **3**: Move right (to the adjacent right cell).

- **Indices 4 to 28**: Represent trap placement actions in the grid, with each index corresponding to a specific cell (flattening the 5x5 grid into a single list of 25 cells).
  - **4**: Place a trap at cell (0, 0).
  - **5**: Place a trap at cell (0, 1).
  - ...
  - **28**: Place a trap at cell (4, 4).

Each index from 4 to 28 corresponds to placing a trap in a specific grid cell when the grid is viewed as a single array from top to bottom, left to right, with no traps allowed on occupied cells.
