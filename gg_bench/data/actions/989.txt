In the game, the action space is represented by a discrete space with two indices, 0 and 1, mapped to the following moves:

- **Index 0**: Keep the card - When a player draws a card, choosing action 0 means they decide to keep the card, reveal it to their opponent, and add its value to their score.

- **Index 1**: Discard the card - Choosing action 1 means the player discards the card, places it face up in the discard pile, and is required to draw the next card from the deck, adding its value to their score regardless of whether it is positive or negative.
