# Multiplication Showdown Rule Book

## Objective

**Multiplication Showdown** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to reach or exceed a target number through multiplication. The primary goal is to strategically select multipliers to reach the target number **100** before your opponent does. Skillful selection and foresight will lead you to victory, while careless choices may hand the game to your opponent.

## Setup

1. **Starting Total**: The game begins with a shared current total of **1**.
2. **Target Number**: The objective is to reach or exceed a total of **100**.
3. **Available Multipliers**: Numbers **2** through **9** are available for multiplication.
4. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Current Total**: A shared numerical value starting at **1** and updated each turn.
- **Available Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** that players choose to multiply the current total.
- **Target Number**: The number **100**, which players aim to reach or exceed.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen multipliers during their turns.

## Turns

- Players take turns in sequence.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Current Total**: The game displays the current total before each turn.
  2. **Choose Multiplier**: The active player selects a multiplier (an integer from **2** to **9**).
  3. **Update Total**: The current total is multiplied by the chosen multiplier.
  4. **Check for Victory**: The game checks if the new total is **≥ 100**.
- **Progression**: The updated total carries over to the next player's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing Multipliers**:
   - On their turn, a player must select a multiplier between **2** and **9**.
   - Multipliers can be reused any number of times throughout the game.
2. **Valid Moves**:
   - The chosen multiplier is applied to the current total.
   - Example: If the current total is **5** and the player chooses **3**, the new total is **15**.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a current total of **100** or more wins the game.
4. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn; a multiplier must be chosen each turn.
5. **Input Validation**:
   - If a player inputs an invalid multiplier (e.g., a number outside **2-9**), they are prompted to choose again.
6. **Game End Condition**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player reaches or exceeds the target number during their turn.
7. **No Draws**:
   - Since only one player can reach or exceed the target number first, draws are not possible.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The winner is the player who first reaches or surpasses the target total of **100**.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use a point system; victory is determined solely by reaching the target number.
- **Skill Emphasis**: Success depends on strategic multiplier selection and anticipation of the opponent's moves.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Starting the Game

- **Current Total**: 1
- **Player 1's Turn**

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Total**: 1
- **Player 1 Chooses Multiplier**: 5

- **Player 2 Chooses Multiplier**: 4
- **Calculation**: 5 × 4 = **20**
- **Updated Current Total**: 20

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Total**: 20
- **Player 1 Chooses Multiplier**: 3
- **Calculation**: 20 × 3 = **60**
- **Updated Current Total**: 60

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Current Total**: 60
- **Player 2 Chooses Multiplier**: 2
- **Calculation**: 60 × 2 = **120**
- **Updated Current Total**: 120

#### Game End

- **Player 2** has reached **120**, which is greater than **100**.
- **Player 2 Wins**.
