**Game Name:** Divisor Duel

---

### **Objective**

Be the player who forces your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. This occurs when the current number is either 1 or a prime number with no proper divisors (excluding 1 and itself).

---

### **Setup**

- **Starting Number:** The game begins with a positive integer greater than 1. Players can agree on a starting number or choose one randomly within a specified range (e.g., between 10 and 50).

- **Players:** Two players participate, alternating turns.

- **Command-Line Interface:** The game is played in a command-line environment where players input their moves.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Numbers:** Positive integers from the starting number down to 1.

- **Proper Divisors:** For any given number, the integers (excluding 1 and the number itself) that divide it evenly.

- **No Physical Components:** All interactions occur through the command line; no physical pieces, tokens, boards, or cards are required.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order:** Players decide who goes first by mutual agreement or random selection.

- **Structure of a Turn:**

  1. **Identify Proper Divisors:** The current player lists all proper divisors of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself).

  2. **Select a Divisor:** The player chooses one of the proper divisors to subtract.

  3. **Subtract the Divisor:** The chosen divisor is subtracted from the current number to form a new current number.

  4. **Announce the Move:** The player declares their chosen divisor and the new current number.

- **Progression of Turns:** Players alternate turns following the same structure until the game ends.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves:**

   - The chosen number to subtract must be a proper divisor of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
   - Only one proper divisor can be subtracted per turn.

2. **Calculating Proper Divisors:**

   - Proper divisors are numbers that divide the current number evenly without leaving a remainder.
   - For example, the proper divisors of 12 are 2, 3, 4, and 6.

3. **Updating the Current Number:**

   - The new current number is calculated by subtracting the chosen divisor from the current number.
   - The current number must always remain a positive integer greater than 0.

4. **Winning the Game:**

   - A player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn because the current number has no proper divisors (i.e., it is prime or 1).
   - The opponent wins the game when a player cannot make a valid move.

5. **No Skipping Turns:**

   - Players must make a valid move if one is available; skipping a turn is not allowed.

6. **No Draws:**

   - The game continues until one player wins; there are no draw conditions.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winning:** The player who forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.

- **Tracking Progress:** No points are tracked during the game; the focus is on strategic play to win.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1**

- **Starting Number:** 18

**Game Play:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 18: 2, 3, 6, 9
   - Chooses to subtract 9.
   - New current number: 18 - 9 = 9
   - Announces: "Subtract 9, new number is 9."

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 9: 3
   - Chooses to subtract 3.
   - New current number: 9 - 3 = 6
   - Announces: "Subtract 3, new number is 6."

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 6: 2, 3
   - Chooses to subtract 3.
   - New current number: 6 - 3 = 3
   - Announces: "Subtract 3, new number is 3."

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Current number is 3 (a prime number).
   - No proper divisors; cannot make a valid move.
   - Announces: "No valid moves. I lose."

**Result:** Player 1 wins.

#### **Example 2**

- **Starting Number:** 15

**Game Play:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 15: 3, 5
   - Chooses to subtract 5.
   - New current number: 15 - 5 = 10
   - Announces: "Subtract 5, new number is 10."

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 10: 2, 5
   - Chooses to subtract 2.
   - New current number: 10 - 2 = 8
   - Announces: "Subtract 2, new number is 8."

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 8: 2, 4
   - Chooses to subtract 4.
   - New current number: 8 - 4 = 4
   - Announces: "Subtract 4, new number is 4."

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Proper divisors of 4: 2
   - Chooses to subtract 2.
   - New current number: 4 - 2 = 2
   - Announces: "Subtract 2, new number is 2."

5. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Current number is 2 (a prime number).
   - No proper divisors; cannot make a valid move.
   - Announces: "No valid moves. I lose."

**Result:** Player 2 wins.

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

**Starting Number:** 12

```plaintext
Player 1's turn.
Current number is 12.
Proper divisors (excluding 1 and 12): 2, 3, 4, 6
Enter the divisor to subtract: 6
You subtract 6. New current number is 6.

Player 2's turn.
Current number is 6.
Proper divisors (excluding 1 and 6): 2, 3
Enter the divisor to subtract: 2
You subtract 2. New current number is 4.

Player 1's turn.
Current number is 4.
Proper divisors (excluding 1 and 4): 2
Enter the divisor to subtract: 2
You subtract 2. New current number is 2.

Player 2's turn.
Current number is 2.
No proper divisors. You cannot make a move.
Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins!
```

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the current number and aim to force them into a prime number or 1.

- **Reduce Options:** Choose divisors that reduce the current number to one with fewer proper divisors, limiting your opponent's choices.

- **Balance the Numbers:** Be cautious when the current number is low; avoid leaving your opponent with a number that gives them a winning move.

- **Know Your Numbers:** Familiarity with prime numbers and their role in the game can give you a strategic advantage.
