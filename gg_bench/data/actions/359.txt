In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 19, each corresponding to one of the 20 possible numbers in the shared number pool that players can select. Index 0 represents selecting the number 1, index 1 represents selecting the number 2, and this pattern continues such that index 19 corresponds to selecting the number 20. Each action taken by a player is interpreted as choosing the number represented by the index plus one.
