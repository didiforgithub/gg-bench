The action space indices in the gym environment correspond to perfect squares, with each index representing a perfect square from \(1^2\) to \(10^2\). Specifically, action index 0 maps to the perfect square \(1^2\), index 1 to \(2^2\), index 2 to \(3^2\), and so on, up to index 9 which maps to \(10^2\). The allowed actions thus align directly with choosing which perfect square (between 1 and 100 inclusive) to subtract from the total in the game.
