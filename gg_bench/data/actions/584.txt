The action space indices in the game correspond to pairs of numbers and actions. There are 18 possible actions, derived from 9 numbers (1 through 9) each having 2 possible actions: "Add" or "Subtract." The index of an action, `a`, is calculated as follows:

- `number_index = a // 2` gives the index of the number (0 for 1, 1 for 2, etc.).
- `action_type = a % 2` indicates the action (0 for "Add" to own life, 1 for "Subtract" from opponent's life).

Thus, action indices map sequentially:
- Index 0: Add 1 to own life
- Index 1: Subtract 1 from opponent's life
- Index 2: Add 2 to own life
- Index 3: Subtract 2 from opponent's life
- ...
- Index 16: Add 9 to own life
- Index 17: Subtract 9 from opponent's life
