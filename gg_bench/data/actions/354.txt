The action space indices are mapped to moves in the game through a predefined dictionary `action_to_tuple`, where each index corresponds to a specific combination of two numbers and an operation. The indices from 0 to 71 represent actions involving pairs of distinct numbers from the grid, with two possible operations: addition or subtraction. For example, if the numbers chosen are 3 and 5, there are two possible actions: (3, 5, "add") or (3, 5, "subtract"). The remaining indices from 72 to 80 are reserved for single-number actions, reflecting situations where only one number remains in a player's grid, so the action is simply to eliminate that number without any arithmetic operation.
