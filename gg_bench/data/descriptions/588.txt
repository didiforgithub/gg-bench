# Multiply or Add

## Objective

The objective of **Multiply or Add** is to be the first player to reach the target number **N** exactly by strategically choosing to either add or multiply numbers during your turn. The player who reaches the target number **N** first wins the game. If a player cannot make a legal move without exceeding **N**, they lose the game.

## Setup

- **Target Number (N):** Decide on a target number to reach. By default, **N = 100**, but players can agree on any reasonable positive integer to suit their desired game length and difficulty.
- **Starting Number:** The game begins with a current number of **1**.
- **Player Order:** Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Current Number:** A shared number that starts at **1** and is updated after each turn based on player actions.
- **Operations:**
  - **Addition:** Adding an integer from **1** to **9** to the current number.
  - **Multiplication:** Multiplying the current number by an integer from **2** to **5**.
- **Target Number (N):** The number players aim to reach exactly to win the game.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- During a turn, a player must choose one of the following actions:
  1. **Add** an integer between **1** and **9** (inclusive) to the current number.
  2. **Multiply** the current number by an integer between **2** and **5** (inclusive).
- After performing the operation, the new current number is announced.
- A player's turn ends after they perform their chosen operation.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Legal Moves:**
   - **Addition:** You may add any integer from **1** to **9** to the current number.
   - **Multiplication:** You may multiply the current number by any integer from **2** to **5**.
2. **Staying Within Bounds:**
   - The result of your operation must not exceed the target number **N**.
   - If all possible moves would result in a number greater than **N**, the player loses the game.
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to make the current number exactly equal to **N** wins.
4. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players must make a move on their turn if at least one legal move is available.
5. **Command-Line Interaction:**
   - Players input their chosen operation and number during their turn.
   - Example inputs:
     - `add 5` (to add 5 to the current number)
     - `multiply 3` (to multiply the current number by 3)

## Scoring

- **Winning:**
  - The player who reaches the target number **N** exactly wins the game.
- **Losing:**
  - If a player cannot make a legal move without exceeding **N**, they lose the game.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Target Number (N):** 50  
**Starting Number:** 1

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current Number:** 1
   - Chooses to **multiply by 5**.
   - **Calculation:** 1 x 5 = 5
   - **New Current Number:** 5

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current Number:** 5
   - Chooses to **add 9**.
   - **Calculation:** 5 + 9 = 14
   - **New Current Number:** 14

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current Number:** 14
   - Chooses to **multiply by 3**.
   - **Calculation:** 14 x 3 = 42
   - **New Current Number:** 42

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current Number:** 42
   - Possible addition moves: Adding any number from 1 to 8 (since 42 + 9 = 51 > 50).
   - Possible multiplication moves: Multiplying by 2 (since 42 x 3 = 126 > 50).
   - Chooses to **add 8**.
   - **Calculation:** 42 + 8 = 50
   - **New Current Number:** 50
   - **Player 2 wins!**

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Consider the possible results of your move and how it will set up options for your opponent.
- **Control the Game Flow:** Try to force your opponent into a position where they have no winning moves.
- **Balance Operations:** Use both addition and multiplication to navigate towards the target number efficiently.
- **Avoid Overshooting:** Be cautious not to exceed the target number, as this will result in a loss.
