In the Prime Duel gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 8) correspond directly to the available numbers (2 to 10) in the game. Each index maps to the number it represents:

- Action 0 → Number 2
- Action 1 → Number 3
- Action 2 → Number 4
- Action 3 → Number 5
- Action 4 → Number 6
- Action 5 → Number 7
- Action 6 → Number 8
- Action 7 → Number 9
- Action 8 → Number 10

This mapping allows players to take actions by selecting the corresponding index of the number they wish to choose in their turn.
