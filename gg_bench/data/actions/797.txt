In this gym environment for "Factor Frenzy," the action space indices map directly to numbers on the number line ranging from 1 to 50. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(50)`, meaning it consists of indices 0 through 49. Each index corresponds to a number by adding 1 to the index (i.e., index 0 maps to number 1, index 1 maps to number 2, and so on, up to index 49 mapping to number 50). This mapping allows players to select any number from 1 to 50 by choosing the corresponding index in the action space.
