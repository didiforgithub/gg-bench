# **Quantum Edge**

Welcome to **Quantum Edge**, a strategic two-player turn-based game designed for the command-line interface. **Quantum Edge** combines simple mechanics with deep strategic elements, ensuring that a skilled player can consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent. The game is unique and offers quick, decisive gameplay with no possibility of a draw.

---

## **Objective**

The primary goal of **Quantum Edge** is to be the first player to collapse the Quantum Grid by strategically claiming quantum nodes. A player wins by forcing the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves left, thereby achieving a quantum collapse in their favor.

---

## **Setup**

- **Quantum Grid Initialization**: The game starts with a linear grid of 11 quantum nodes, labeled positions **1** through **11**.
- **Starting Conditions**: All nodes are in a quantum state, unclaimed by either player.
- **Player Assignment**:
  - **Player 1**: Denoted as `A`
  - **Player 2**: Denoted as `B`
- **First Move**: Player 1 (`A`) makes the first move.

---

## **Game Components**

### **Quantum Nodes**

- **Representation**: Each node is represented by its position number when unclaimed, `A` when claimed by Player 1, and `B` when claimed by Player 2.
- **Quantum State**: Nodes start in a neutral quantum state and collapse to a classical state when claimed.

### **Quantum Grid**

- **Structure**: A one-dimensional array (line) of 11 nodes.
- **Visualization**: Displayed in the command-line interface as a sequence of characters.

---

## **Turns**

### **Turn Structure**

- **Action**: On their turn, a player must claim one of the quantum nodes according to the movement rules.
- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1 (`A`).

### **Player Actions**

- **Claiming Nodes**:
  - A player may claim any unclaimed node that is adjacent (next to) a node already claimed by them.
  - If a player has not yet claimed any nodes, they may claim any of the end nodes (positions **1** or **11**).

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **Core Rules**

1. **Initial Move**:
   - Player 1 (`A`) begins by claiming either node **1** or node **11**.
2. **Claiming Nodes**:
   - On subsequent turns, players can only claim unclaimed nodes that are adjacent to their already claimed nodes.
   - Adjacency is defined as positions immediately next to a player's claimed node (either to the left or right).
3. **No Skipping**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If a player has a valid move, they must make it.
4. **Blocked Paths**:
   - Players cannot claim nodes that are only adjacent to nodes claimed by the opponent.

### **Winning the Game**

- **Quantum Collapse**:
  - A player wins if the opponent has no valid moves on their turn.
  - This occurs when all nodes adjacent to the opponent's claimed nodes are already claimed.

### **Unique Mechanics**

- **Edge Strategy**:
  - Since the grid is linear, controlling the edges can trap the opponent.
- **Node Control**:
  - Strategic claiming can block the opponent's expansion while maximizing your own.

## **Scoring**

There is no point system. Victory is achieved by forcing the opponent into a position with no valid moves, resulting in their inability to continue, and thus, you win the game.

## **Examples**

### **Sample Game Play**

Let's illustrate a sample game between Player 1 (`A`) and Player 2 (`B`).

#### **Initial Grid**

```
Positions:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
Grid:       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

#### **Turn 1: Player 1 (`A`)**

- **Action**: Claims node **1**.

```
Grid:       A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

#### **Turn 2: Player 2 (`B`)**

- **Action**: Claims node **11**.

```
Grid:       A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 B
```

#### **Turn 3: Player 1 (`A`)**

- **Possible Moves**: Node **2** (adjacent to node **1**).
- **Action**: Claims node **2**.

```
Grid:       A A 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 B
```

#### **Turn 4: Player 2 (`B`)**

- **Possible Moves**: Node **10** (adjacent to node **11**).
- **Action**: Claims node **10**.

```
Grid:       A A 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 B B
```

#### **Turn 5: Player 1 (`A`)**

- **Possible Moves**: Node **3** (adjacent to node **2**).
- **Action**: Claims node **3**.

```
Grid:       A A A 4 5 6 7 8 9 B B
```

#### **Turn 6: Player 2 (`B`)**

- **Possible Moves**: Node **9** (adjacent to node **10**).
- **Action**: Claims node **9**.

```
Grid:       A A A 4 5 6 7 8 B B B
```

#### **Turn 7: Player 1 (`A`)**

- **Action**: Claims node **4**.

```
Grid:       A A A A 5 6 7 8 B B B
```

#### **Turn 8: Player 2 (`B`)**

- **Action**: Claims node **8**.

```
Grid:       A A A A 5 6 7 B B B B
```

#### **Turn 9: Player 1 (`A`)**

- **Action**: Claims node **5**.

```
Grid:       A A A A A 6 7 B B B B
```

#### **Turn 10: Player 2 (`B`)**

- **Possible Moves**: Node **7** (adjacent to node **8**).
- **Action**: Claims node **7**.

```
Grid:       A A A A A 6 B B B B B
```

#### **Turn 11: Player 1 (`A`)**

- **Action**: Claims node **6**.

```
Grid:       A A A A A A B B B B B
```

#### **Turn 12: Player 2 (`B`)**

- **No Valid Moves**: All nodes adjacent to Player 2's claimed nodes are occupied.
- **Result**: Player 2 (`B`) has no valid moves and loses.

## **Command-Line Interaction Example**

### **Starting the Game**

```
Welcome to Quantum Edge!

Initial Grid:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Player A, it's your turn.
Available moves: 1, 11
Enter the node number you wish to claim: 1
```

### **Gameplay Progression**

```
Grid:
A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Player B, it's your turn.
Available moves: 11
Enter the node number you wish to claim: 11
```

*... and so on, following the sample game play above.*

### **End of Game**

```
Player B, it's your turn.
Available moves: None

Player B has no valid moves left.
Player A wins the game!
```

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Expand Early**: Quickly claim adjacent nodes to increase your control over the grid.
- **Block Opponent**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and block their expansion paths.
- **Control the Center**: Securing central nodes can limit your opponent's options.
- **Forced Moves**: Lead your opponent into positions where their choices are limited.
