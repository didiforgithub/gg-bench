The action space indices from 0 to 8 map to combinations of moves by the two players using the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Each index corresponds to a tuple, where the first element is Player 1's choice and the second element is Player 2's choice. The mapping is as follows:

- Index 0: (1, 1)
- Index 1: (1, 2)
- Index 2: (1, 3)
- Index 3: (2, 1)
- Index 4: (2, 2)
- Index 5: (2, 3)
- Index 6: (3, 1)
- Index 7: (3, 2)
- Index 8: (3, 3)
