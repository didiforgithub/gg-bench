# Number Flip: Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Flip** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where players take turns adding numbers to a cumulative total. The primary goal is to **force your opponent to reach or exceed a total of 50**. The player who causes the cumulative total to reach exactly 50 or surpass it **loses** the game.

---

## Setup

- **Cumulative Total**: Initialize the game's cumulative total to **0** at the start.
- **Available Numbers**: Players can choose any integer from **1 to 10** inclusive.
- **First Player**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by a coin toss or mutual agreement).

---

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Total**: A shared running total that both players contribute to.
- **Numbers (1-10)**: The set of integers players can choose from on their turn.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played by entering numbers via the command line.

---

## Turns

1. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player selects a number from **1 to 10**.
2. **Updating Total**: The chosen number is **added** to the cumulative total.
3. **Turn Restrictions**:
   - **No Repeat**: A player **cannot** choose the same number that was selected on the **immediately preceding turn** by the opponent.
4. **Turn End**: After updating the total, the turn passes to the other player.
5. **Victory Check**: If the cumulative total is **50 or more**, the player who made the move **loses**, and the opponent wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Number Selection**:
  - Players must choose a number between **1 and 10** inclusive.
  - The number selected cannot be the same as the opponent's last chosen number.
- **Cumulative Total Management**:
  - The cumulative total starts at **0** and increases as players add numbers.
  - Players aim to avoid making the total reach **50 or more** on their turn.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - If a player causes the cumulative total to reach **exactly 50** or to exceed **50**, that player **loses**.
  - If a player has **no legal moves** (all available numbers would result in a total of 50 or more), that player **loses**.
- **Illegal Moves**:
  - Selecting a number outside the **1-10** range is not allowed.
  - Choosing the same number as the opponent's last turn is not allowed.
  - If an illegal move is made, the player may be prompted to choose again or may automatically lose (as per agreed rules before the game starts).

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The opponent of the player who causes the cumulative total to reach or exceed **50** is declared the **winner**.
- **Game Tracking**: Players keep track of:
  - The cumulative total after each turn.
  - The last number selected (to enforce the "No Repeat" rule).

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Starting the Game

- **Cumulative Total**: 0
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses **8**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 0 + 8 = **8**
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Cannot choose **8** (since Player 1 just chose it).
  - Chooses **7**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 8 + 7 = **15**

#### Mid-Game

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Cannot choose **7** (Player 2's last number).
  - Chooses **9**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 15 + 9 = **24**
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Cannot choose **9**.
  - Chooses **8**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 24 + 8 = **32**

#### End Game Scenario

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Cannot choose **8**.
  - Chooses **7**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 32 + 7 = **39**
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Cannot choose **7**.
  - Chooses **6**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 39 + 6 = **45**
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Cannot choose **6**.
  - **Options**: 1-5, and 9-10.
  - Chooses **5**.
  - **Cumulative Total**: 45 + 5 = **50**
  - **Player 1 loses** (total is exactly 50).
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins**.
