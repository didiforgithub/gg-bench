In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with two possible actions, represented by the indices 0 and 1. These indices correspond directly to the binary digits that can be appended to the shared binary string:

- Action index 0 corresponds to appending the binary digit '0'.
- Action index 1 corresponds to appending the binary digit '1'.

Thus, the mapping between the action space indices and the player's moves in the game is straightforward: index 0 maps to the move of appending '0', and index 1 maps to appending '1'.
