# Token Showdown: Rule Book

## Objective

**Token Showdown** is a strategic two-player bidding game. The primary goal is to be the first player to earn **five victory points**. Players compete in rounds by bidding tokens to win victory points. Careful management of tokens and strategic bidding are key to achieving victory.

## Setup

1. **Tokens Allocation**: Each player begins the game with **100 tokens**.
2. **Victory Point Tracker**: A simple scoring method (such as tally marks) is used to keep track of each player's victory points.
3. **Starting the Game**: Decide which player takes the first bid. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Tokens**: Each player has a set of tokens used for bidding. Tokens are identical and represent the players' resources.
- **Victory Points**: Points earned by winning bidding rounds. The first to accumulate five victory points wins the game.

## Turns

The game is played in a series of **rounds**, each consisting of the following steps:

1. **Bid Placement**:
   - Both players secretly decide on the number of tokens they wish to bid for the current round.
   - Players can bid any whole number of tokens from **1 up to their total remaining tokens**.
2. **Bid Revelation**:
   - Both players simultaneously reveal their bids.
3. **Resolution**:
   - The player with the **higher bid** wins the round and earns **one victory point**.
   - Both players **subtract** their bid amounts from their total tokens.
4. **Tie Handling**:
   - If both bids are equal, **no victory point** is awarded.
   - Both players still **lose the tokens** they bid.
5. **Token Check**:
   - If a player runs out of tokens, they can no longer participate in bidding and **lose the game** if they cannot bid in the next round.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Bidding Limits**: 
  - Players must bid at least **one token** per round.
  - A player cannot bid more tokens than they currently have.
- **Winning a Round**:
  - The player with the higher bid earns **one victory point**.
- **Token Management**:
  - Careful management of tokens is essential. Overspending can leave a player unable to bid in future rounds.
- **Exhaustion of Tokens**:
  - If a player has **zero tokens** at the start of a round, they cannot place a bid and automatically **lose the game**.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to reach **five victory points** through successful bids wins the game.
  - If both players reach five victory points in the same round, the player with more remaining tokens wins. If tokens are equal, play additional rounds until the tie is broken.
