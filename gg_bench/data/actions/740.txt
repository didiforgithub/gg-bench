The action space indices in the game map directly to selecting numbers from 2 to 50. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 2, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 3, and so on, up to action index 48, which corresponds to selecting the number 50. Therefore, the action chosen by a player translates to selecting a number by adding 2 to the action index.
