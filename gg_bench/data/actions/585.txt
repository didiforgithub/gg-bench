The action space in the gym environment is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to the initial Current Number (100), inclusive. Each index in this space represents selecting a specific integer as a potential divisor during the game. Proper divisors are integers that are greater than 1 and less than the Current Number that divide it evenly. The environment checks if the chosen index corresponds to a proper divisor; if it does, the move is valid, and the Current Number is divided by that integer. Indices less than 2 or not corresponding to a proper divisor of the Current Number are considered invalid actions.
