In the environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 6 possible actions (indices 0 to 5). Each action index corresponds directly to choosing a number between 1 and 6 for a die roll. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to choosing the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to choosing the number 2, and so forth up to action index 5, which corresponds to choosing the number 6. This mapping allows players to simulate choosing which number to "roll" with their die, determining their potential move on the game array.
