In the game, each action space index corresponds to selecting a number from 1 to 20. Specifically, action indices 0 through 19 map to numbers 1 through 20, respectively. For example, an action index of 0 represents choosing the number 1, an index of 1 represents choosing the number 2, and so on, up to an index of 19 representing choosing the number 20.
