# StackUp: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

Be the first player to collect sticks whose total value adds up to **exactly 10** points. Use strategic planning to choose sticks that help you reach the target while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

- **Sticks** numbered **1** to **5** are placed on the table.
- Each stick is worth a number of points equal to its number.
- All sticks are initially available for both players to pick.

## Game Components

- **Sticks Numbered 1 to 5**: Each stick represents both an item to be collected and its point value.
  - **Appearance**: Represented by their numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in the command-line interface.
  - **Functionality**: Picking up a stick adds its number to the player's total score.
  - **Unique Attributes**: Each stick can only be picked once during the game.

## Turns

- Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
- Players take turns alternately.
- **During a Turn**:
  - A player may pick up **one or two sticks** from the available sticks.
  - The sticks chosen are removed from the available pool.
  - The values of the picked sticks are added to the player's cumulative score.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After a player has picked their sticks and updated their score, the turn passes to the other player.
  - The game continues until a player wins or no valid moves remain.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Picking Sticks**:
   - On your turn, you may pick **one or two sticks** from the remaining available sticks.
   - You cannot pick more than two sticks in a single turn.
   - Once a stick is picked, it is no longer available for either player.

2. **Scoring Limit**:
   - The goal is to reach a total score of **exactly 10 points**.
   - If picking a stick would cause your total score to **exceed 10**, you cannot pick that stick.
   - If you cannot pick any sticks without exceeding a total of 10, you must **skip your turn**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a total score of **exactly 10 points** wins the game.
   - If no player can make a valid move, the player with the total score **closest to 10 without exceeding it** wins.
   - There is **no draw** mechanism; the game will always have a winner.

4. **Strategy Considerations**:
   - Plan your picks to reach exactly 10 while preventing your opponent from doing so.
   - Keep track of which sticks have been picked to anticipate possible moves.
   - Decide whether to pick one or two sticks based on the current scores and remaining sticks.

## Scoring

- **Player Scores**:
  - Each player's score is the sum of the values of the sticks they have picked.
  - Scores are updated after each turn.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - Reaching **exactly 10 points** results in an immediate win.
  - If the game ends with no valid moves, the player with the higher score **not exceeding 10** wins.
