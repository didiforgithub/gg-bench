## Spy Versus Spy: A Grid Navigation Duel

### Objective

Be the first player to navigate your spy from your base to your opponent's base on a shared grid filled with hidden traps. Use strategic movement and revealed information to outmaneuver your opponent and reach the goal before they do.

### Setup

- **Grid Creation**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, creating a total of 25 cells. The grid coordinates range from (0,0) at the top-left corner to (4,4) at the bottom-right corner.
- **Base Positions**:
  - **Player 1** starts at their base located at cell **(0,0)** (top-left corner).
  - **Player 2** starts at their base located at cell **(4,4)** (bottom-right corner).
- **Trap Placement**:
  - **Five traps** are randomly placed on the grid at the start of the game.
  - The positions of the traps are **hidden** from both players.
  - The trap locations are the **same for both players**, ensuring a fair challenge.

### Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid represented in the command-line interface, with cells identified by their coordinates (row, column).
- **Spies**: Each player controls a spy represented by a unique symbol:
  - **Player 1**: `S1`
  - **Player 2**: `S2`
- **Cells**:
  - **Unknown Cells**: Represented by `?`, indicating unrevealed areas.
  - **Safe Cells**: Once revealed, safe cells are marked with `.`.
  - **Trap Cells**: When revealed, trap cells are marked with `X`.
  - **Bases**: Marked with `B1` for Player 1's base and `B2` for Player 2's base.

### Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - **Player 1** takes the first turn.
  - Players alternate turns thereafter.
- **Turn Actions**:
  - **Movement**: On your turn, move your spy to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).
  - **Revealing Cells**:
    - The cell you move into becomes revealed.
    - If the cell is a trap, you must return to your base.

### Rules and Mechanics

#### Movement Rules

- **Adjacency**: Spies can move to any horizontally or vertically adjacent cell.
- **Boundaries**: Spies cannot move outside the grid boundaries.
- **Occupancy**: Both spies can occupy the same cell; however, there is no interaction between spies in the same cell.

#### Cell Revealing

- **Safe Cells (`.`)**:
  - If you move into a safe cell, your spy remains there.
  - The cell stays revealed for both players for the rest of the game.
- **Trap Cells (`X`)**:
  - If you move into a trap cell, your spy is immediately sent back to your base.
  - The trap cell is revealed and remains visible to both players.

#### Returning to Base

- **Trap Trigger**:
  - Upon triggering a trap, you lose any progress and must start over from your base on your next turn.
- **No Penalty for Safe Cells**:
  - Moving into a safe cell does not affect your spy negatively.

#### Victory Conditions

- **Winning the Game**:
  - Reach your opponent's base before they reach yours.
  - You must land exactly on the opponent's base cell to win.

### Scoring

No point system is used. The game is won by successfully reaching the opponent's base according to the victory conditions.

### Examples

#### Example Turn Sequence

Assume both players start with the grid unrevealed:

```
Player 1 (S1) starts at (0,0)
Player 2 (S2) starts at (4,4)
```

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Move from (0,0) to (0,1)
- **Result**:
  - Cell (0,1) is revealed.
  - Suppose (0,1) is a **safe cell (`.`)**.
- **Grid Update**:

```
[ S1 ][  . ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][ B2 ]
```

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Move from (4,4) to (4,3)
- **Result**:
  - Cell (4,3) is revealed.
  - Suppose (4,3) is a **trap cell (`X`)**.
  - Player 2 returns to base at (4,4).
- **Grid Update**:

```
[ S1 ][  . ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  X ][ S2 ]
```

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Move from (0,1) to (0,2)
- **Result**:
  - Cell (0,2) is revealed.
  - Suppose (0,2) is a **safe cell (`.`)**.
- **Grid Update**:

```
[  . ][ S1 ][  . ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  X ][ S2 ]
```

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action**: Attempt to move from (4,4) to (3,4)
- **Result**:
  - Cell (3,4) is revealed.
  - Suppose (3,4) is a **safe cell (`.`)**.
  - Player 2 moves to (3,4).
- **Grid Update**:

```
[  . ][ S1 ][  . ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][ S2 ]
[  ? ][  ? ][  ? ][  X ][  . ]
```

**Gameplay Continues**

Players continue taking turns, revealing more of the grid and navigating towards each other's bases while avoiding traps.

#### Sample Command-Line Interaction

**Player 1's Turn**

```
It's Player 1's turn.
Current Position: (0,1)
Enter move direction (up, down, left, right): right
You moved right to (0,2).
Cell (0,2) is safe.
```

**Player 2's Turn**

```
It's Player 2's turn.
Current Position: (4,4)
Enter move direction (up, down, left, right): up
You moved up to (3,4).
Cell (3,4) is safe.
```

**Player 1 Encounters a Trap**

```
It's Player 1's turn.
Current Position: (0,2)
Enter move direction (up, down, left, right): down
You moved down to (1,2).
Oh no! You hit a trap at (1,2)!
Returning to base at (0,0).
```

### Additional Notes

- **Strategy Tips**:
  - **Memory**: Keep track of revealed safe cells and traps to plan your route effectively.
  - **Risk Management**: Decide when to explore new cells or use known safe paths.
  - **Anticipate Opponent**: Watch your opponent's moves to infer safe paths and potential traps.
- **Game Balance**:
  - Since both players share the same trap locations, the game is balanced and fair.
  - The element of chance is minimized as the game progresses and more of the grid is revealed.

### Summary

"Spy Versus Spy: A Grid Navigation Duel" is a strategic, turn-based game that challenges players to navigate through a hidden grid filled with traps. With simple mechanics suitable for a command-line interface, the game emphasizes strategic planning, memory, and adaptability. The first spy to successfully reach the opponent's base wins the game.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best spy win!
