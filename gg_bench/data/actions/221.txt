In the game environment, the action space indices (0 to 8) map directly to the numbers on the 3x3 grid (1 to 9). Specifically, the action index corresponds to the number that is one greater than the index, so index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 to number 2, and so on up to index 8, which corresponds to number 9. This straightforward mapping allows each index in the action space to represent a specific position on the grid, reflecting the number a player chooses during their turn.
