The action space indices range from 0 to 122. Indices 0 to 119 correspond to the Trapper's trap placement combinations, where each index represents a unique selection of three distinct cells (from cells 1 to 10) in which to place traps. Indices 120 to 122 correspond to the Runner's movement choices: index 120 represents moving forward 1 step, index 121 represents moving 2 steps, and index 122 represents moving 3 steps. This setup allows both players to have separate and distinct action spaces.
