The action space indices map to moves in the game by assigning each pair of numbers from the pool (1 to 9) with each of the two operations (addition and multiplication). The `combinations` function generates all possible pairs of numbers, and for each pair, two actions are created: one for addition (`+`) and one for multiplication (`*`). Each unique combination of number pair and operation is given a unique index, which is used to look up the corresponding move (action). These mappings are stored in the `action_mapping` dictionary, where the key is the index and the value is the tuple representing the move (num1, num2, operation). This setup allows for a discrete action space where each index directly corresponds to a specific set of numbers and an operation in the game.
