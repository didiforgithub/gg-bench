# Divisor Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the player who makes the last valid move by reducing a shared number, **N**, to a prime number or zero. Players take turns subtracting proper divisors of the current number **N**. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number Selection**:
   - Players agree on a positive integer **N** to start the game. It can be any integer greater than 1. For a quick game, it's recommended to choose a smaller number (e.g., between 10 and 30).

2. **Player Assignment**:
   - Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (**`N`**)**:
  - A positive integer that both players will manipulate throughout the game. It is displayed prominently in the command-line interface at the start and updated after each turn.

- **Proper Divisors**:
  - The numbers that divide **N** exactly, excluding 1 and **N** itself. These are the options a player can choose from on their turn.

- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2**, who will alternate turns.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with the player designated during setup.

2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Displaying Current Number**: The current value of **N** is displayed.
   - **Calculating Proper Divisors**: The game lists all proper divisors of **N** (excluding 1 and **N**).
   - **Player Action**: The player selects one of the listed proper divisors to subtract from **N**.
   - **Updating Number**: **N** is updated to `N - (chosen divisor)`.
   - **Turn End**: The turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On their turn, a player must subtract one of the proper divisors of the current **N** (excluding 1 and **N** itself).
   - If **N** has no proper divisors other than 1 and itself (i.e., **N** is a prime number or 1), the player cannot make a move and loses the game.

2. **Proper Divisors Calculation**:
   - Proper divisors are all positive integers less than **N** that divide **N** without leaving a remainder, excluding 1 and **N**.
   - The game will assist by listing these divisors at the start of each turn.

3. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The last player who made a valid move is declared the winner.

4. **No Draws**:
   - There is no possibility of a draw. The game will always result in a win for one player.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The winner is the player who forces the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.
  - There is no point-scoring system; victory is achieved by making the last valid move.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Starting Conditions:

- **Starting Number (**`N`**)**: 21
- **Player 1**: Alice
- **Player 2**: Bob
- **Player 1** takes the first turn.

---

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown:

**--- Turn 1 ---**

- **Current N**: 21
- **Proper Divisors of 21**: 3, 7
- **Alice's Move**:
  - Chooses to subtract 7.
  - **Calculation**: 21 - 7 = 14
- **Updated N**: 14

**--- Turn 2 ---**

- **Current N**: 14
- **Proper Divisors of 14**: 2, 7
- **Bob's Move**:
  - Chooses to subtract 7.
  - **Calculation**: 14 - 7 = 7
- **Updated N**: 7

**--- Turn 3 ---**

- **Current N**: 7
- **Proper Divisors of 7**: None (since 7 is a prime number)
- **Alice's Move**:
  - Cannot make a valid move.
- **Result**:
  - **Bob wins** because Alice cannot make a valid move.

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

Below is an example of how the game might play out in a command-line interface.

#### Game Start:

```
Welcome to Divisor Duel!

Enter the starting number (N): 15

Player 1 (Alice) will go first.
```

#### Turn 1 - Alice:

```
Current N: 15
Proper divisors of 15 (excluding 1 and 15): 3, 5

Alice, it's your turn.
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 5

You chose to subtract 5 from N.
Updated N is now: 10
```

#### Turn 2 - Bob:

```
Current N: 10
Proper divisors of 10 (excluding 1 and 10): 2, 5

Bob, it's your turn.
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 5

You chose to subtract 5 from N.
Updated N is now: 5
```

#### Turn 3 - Alice:

```
Current N: 5
Proper divisors of 5 (excluding 1 and 5): None

Alice, there are no valid moves. You cannot make a move.

Bob wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the consequences of your move on the subsequent turns. Try to force your opponent into a position where the remaining N is a prime number on their turn.

- **Avoid Prime Numbers on Your Turn**: Try not to reduce N to a prime number on your turn unless it guarantees a win.

- **Use Larger Divisors When Advantageous**: Subtracting larger proper divisors can rapidly decrease N, but ensure that it doesn't give an advantage to your opponent.
