The action space indices map to moves in the game as follows:

- **0**: Move upward by changing the current position to one row above, keeping the column the same (-1, 0).
- **1**: Move downward by changing the current position to one row below, keeping the column the same (+1, 0).
- **2**: Move left by changing the current position to the column immediately to the left, keeping the row the same (0, -1).
- **3**: Move right by changing the current position to the column immediately to the right, keeping the row the same (0, +1).
