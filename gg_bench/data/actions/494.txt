In the game environment, the action space indices are mapped to the move distances as follows: action index 0 corresponds to moving forward 1 position, action index 1 corresponds to moving forward 2 positions, and action index 2 corresponds to moving forward 3 positions. This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index to determine the actual move distance.
