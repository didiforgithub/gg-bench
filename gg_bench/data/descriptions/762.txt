# Quantum Conquest: A Two-Player Turn-Based Strategy Game

## Objective

In **Quantum Conquest**, players aim to be the first to reach a predetermined score by capturing quantum particles on a grid. Victory is achieved by strategically predicting and capturing particles before your opponent does. There are no draws; the first player to reach the target score wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, with rows labeled `A` to `E` and columns labeled `1` to `5`.
2. **Particle Placement**: At the start of the game, 10 quantum particles are randomly placed on the grid. Each particle has a hidden value between 1 and 3, which determines its point value upon capture.
3. **Player Positions**: Players do not have physical tokens on the grid. Instead, they interact with the grid by selecting coordinates during their turns.
4. **Starting Conditions**: Both players begin with a score of zero. A random method (e.g., coin toss) determines which player takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid serving as the game board. It is represented in the command-line interface with rows `A-E` and columns `1-5`.
- **Quantum Particles**: Invisible entities scattered on the grid. Each particle has:
  - **Position**: A set of coordinates (e.g., `B3`).
  - **Value**: A hidden point value (1, 2, or 3).
- **Score Tracker**: Displays each player's current score.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns. The player who goes first is determined randomly at the start of the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Select a Coordinate**: The player chooses a grid coordinate to scan (e.g., `C4`).
  2. **Receive Feedback**:
     - If a particle is at the chosen coordinate, the player captures it and gains its point value.
     - If no particle is present, the player is informed that the scan was empty.
  3. **Particle Movement**: After each turn, all remaining particles may move to an adjacent cell (including diagonals). Movement is random.
  4. **Display Scores**: The current scores are displayed after each turn.
  
## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Scanning**:
   - On their turn, a player scans a single coordinate.
   - Scanning reveals whether a particle is present or not.
   - If a particle is present:
     - The particle is captured, and its value is added to the player's score.
     - The particle is removed from the grid.
   - If no particle is present:
     - The player gains no points.

2. **Particle Movement**:
   - After each turn, each remaining particle has a chance to move to a random adjacent cell (including diagonals).
   - Particles cannot move off the grid.
   - If two particles move to the same cell, they both occupy it.

3. **Overlapping Particles**:
   - Multiple particles can occupy the same cell.
   - Scanning a cell with multiple particles captures all particles in that cell, and their values are added together.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach or exceed **10 points** wins the game.
   - Since particle values range from 1 to 3, strategic captures are essential.
  
5. **End of Game Conditions**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player reaches at least 10 points.
   - If all particles are captured and no player has reached 10 points, the player with the higher score wins.

## Scoring

- **Capturing Particles**:
  - Each captured particle's value is added to the player's score.
- **Score Tracking**:
  - Scores are displayed after each turn.
  - The target score to win is 10 points.

## Examples

### Sample Turn Sequence

#### Initial Setup:

- Particles are randomly placed on the grid.
- Player 1 and Player 2 have 0 points.
- Player 1 goes first.

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `B2`.
- **Outcome**: No particle found.
- **Score**: Player 1: 0 points, Player 2: 0 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Particles may move to adjacent cells.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `D5`.
- **Outcome**: Particle found with a value of 2.
- **Score**: Player 1: 0 points, Player 2: 2 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `C3`.
- **Outcome**: Particle found with a value of 3.
- **Score**: Player 1: 3 points, Player 2: 2 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `C3`.
- **Outcome**: No particle found (was just captured by Player 1).
- **Score**: Player 1: 3 points, Player 2: 2 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `E4`.
- **Outcome**: Two particles found (values 1 and 2).
- **Score**: Player 1: 6 points (3+1+2), Player 2: 2 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 6: Player 2

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `A1`.
- **Outcome**: Particle found with a value of 3.
- **Score**: Player 1: 6 points, Player 2: 5 points (2+3).
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 7: Player 1

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `B4`.
- **Outcome**: Particle found with a value of 2.
- **Score**: Player 1: 8 points (6+2), Player 2: 5 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 8: Player 2

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `E5`.
- **Outcome**: No particle found.
- **Score**: Player 1: 8 points, Player 2: 5 points.
- **Particle Movement**: Remaining particles may move.

#### Turn 9: Player 1

- **Action**: Scans coordinate `C2`.
- **Outcome**: Particle found with a value of 3.
- **Score**: Player 1: 11 points (8+3).
- **Victory**: Player 1 has reached 11 points and wins the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Welcome to Quantum Conquest!

Particles are being placed on the grid...
Player 1 and Player 2 both have 0 points.
Player 1 goes first.

---- Turn 1: Player 1 ----
Enter coordinate to scan (e.g., A1): B2
Scanning B2...
No particle found.
Scores - Player 1: 0, Player 2: 0

---- Turn 2: Player 2 ----
Enter coordinate to scan (e.g., A1): D5
Scanning D5...
Particle found! You captured it and earned 2 points.
Scores - Player 1: 0, Player 2: 2

(And so on...)
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Predict Movement**: Pay attention to which areas have been scanned, and anticipate where particles might move.
- **Corner Grids**: Particles have fewer movement options in corners; scanning these can be advantageous.
- **Overlapping Particles**: Targeting areas where particles might converge can yield higher points.
- **Denying Opponent**: Scanning spots your opponent might aim for can prevent them from gaining points.
