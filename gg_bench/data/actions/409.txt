In the provided gym environment for Number Quest, the action space comprises 50 discrete actions, where indices map to specific game moves as follows:

- **Action indices 0-40**: Correspond to declaring a prediction for the final sum. The predicted sum is calculated by subtracting 15 from the action index, yielding a prediction range from -15 (action 0) to 25 (action 40).

- **Action indices 41-49**: Correspond to selecting numbers from the available number pool. The number selected is the index minus 40, so action 41 selects the number 1, action 42 selects the number 2, and so on, up to action 49, which selects the number 9.
