The action space indices in the game are mapped directly to the numbers available for selection from the shared pool, where each index corresponds to a number. Specifically, index `0` represents the number `1`, index `1` represents the number `2`, and so on, up to index `8` representing the number `9`. This mapping is achieved by adding `1` to the action index to determine the selected number during the game.
