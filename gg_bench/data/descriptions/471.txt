*An Original Two-Player Turn-Based Game*

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player to successfully make a valid move according to the game rules. You win by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

### **Setup**

- **Number Sequence**: Start with an empty sequence.
- **Available Numbers**: Digits from **1** to **9** (inclusive). Each number can be used only once during the game.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Sequence**:
  - A list that records the numbers played in order.
  - Starts empty and grows as players add numbers on their turns.

- **Available Numbers**:
  - The digits **1** through **9**.
  - Once a number is used, it cannot be selected again by either player.

- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2** alternate turns.
  - Player 1 makes the first move.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.

- **Turn Actions**:
  - **Select a Number**: Choose an unused number from **1** to **9**.
  - **Add to Sequence**: Append the chosen number to the end of the sequence.
  - **Validity Check**:
    - **First Turn**: Any number from **1** to **9** can be chosen.
    - **Subsequent Turns**: The chosen number must be a **factor** or **multiple** of the **last number** in the sequence.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Move**:
   - Player 1 selects any number from **1** to **9** and adds it to the sequence.

2. **Valid Numbers**:
   - **Factors**: Numbers that divide evenly into the last number (without remainder).
   - **Multiples**: Numbers that the last number divides evenly into.

3. **Number Restrictions**:
   - Each number from **1** to **9** can be used **only once**.
   - Once a number is in the sequence, it cannot be selected again.

4. **Valid Move Criteria**:
   - The chosen number must satisfy:
     - It is **unused**.
     - It is a **factor** or **multiple** of the **last number** in the sequence.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Victory Condition**: Your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - **Losing Condition**: You cannot make a valid move on your turn.
