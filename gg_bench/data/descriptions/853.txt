**Game Title:** Number Takedown

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to reduce the shared number to exactly zero by strategically subtracting proper divisors on your turn.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Select the Starting Number (N):**
   - Players agree on a starting positive integer greater than 1 (e.g., N = 25).
   - This number will be the shared value that players will manipulate during the game.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide who will take the first turn by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N):**
  - A positive integer that both players will subtract from during their turns.
  - Updated after each turn to reflect the new value.

- **Proper Divisors:**
  - For any given N, the proper divisors are all positive integers greater than 1 and less than N that divide N exactly (without leaving a remainder).
  - Players need to identify these divisors on their turn.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Announcement of Current N:**
     - The current value of N is displayed or announced at the beginning of each turn.
  2. **Identify Proper Divisors:**
     - The active player determines all proper divisors of N (excluding 1 and N itself).
  3. **Subtract a Divisor:**
     - The player selects one proper divisor and subtracts it from N.
  4. **Update N:**
     - The new value of N is announced for the next player's turn.

- **Turn Progression:**
  - Players alternate turns until the game ends.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must subtract a proper divisor of the current N.
   - **Proper Divisors Exclude:**
     - The number 1.
     - The number N itself.

2. **Subtracting Divisors:**
   - The selected divisor is subtracted from N:
     \[
     N_{\text{new}} = N_{\text{current}} - \text{Proper Divisor}
     \]
   - The result must be a positive integer greater than or equal to zero.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Victory Condition:**
     - If you reduce N to exactly zero on your turn, you win the game.
   - **Losing Condition:**
     - If it's your turn and no proper divisors (excluding 1) exist for N (i.e., N is prime or N = 1), you cannot make a move and lose the game.

4. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a tie; there will always be a winner and a loser.

5. **Important Notes:**
   - **Prime Numbers:**
     - When N is a prime number greater than 2, it has no proper divisors other than 1 and itself.
     - Players cannot subtract 1 or N; thus, the player faced with a prime N loses.
   - **Strategic Play:**
     - Aim to force your opponent into a position where N becomes a prime number on their turn.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winner:**
  - The player who reduces N to exactly zero on their turn.
- **Loser:**
  - The player who cannot make a valid move because N has no proper divisors (excluding 1).

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1**

**Starting N:** 18

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 18
   - **Proper Divisors:** 2, 3, 6, 9
   - **Action:** Subtract 9
   - **New N:** 18 - 9 = 9

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 9
   - **Proper Divisors:** 3
   - **Action:** Subtract 3
   - **New N:** 9 - 3 = 6

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 6
   - **Proper Divisors:** 2, 3
   - **Action:** Subtract 3
   - **New N:** 6 - 3 = 3

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 3
   - **Proper Divisors:** None (since 3 is prime)
   - **Outcome:** Player 2 cannot move and loses.

**Winner:** Player 1

---

#### **Example 2**

**Starting N:** 25

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 25
   - **Proper Divisors:** 5
   - **Action:** Subtract 5
   - **New N:** 25 - 5 = 20

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 20
   - **Proper Divisors:** 2, 4, 5, 10
   - **Action:** Subtract 10
   - **New N:** 20 - 10 = 10

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 10
   - **Proper Divisors:** 2, 5
   - **Action:** Subtract 5
   - **New N:** 10 - 5 = 5

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **Current N:** 5
   - **Proper Divisors:** None (since 5 is prime)
   - **Outcome:** Player 2 cannot move and loses.

**Winner:** Player 1

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

**Starting N:** 12

**Player 1's Turn:**

```
Current N: 12
Proper divisors of 12 (excluding 1 and 12): 2, 3, 4, 6
Enter the divisor to subtract: 6
New N after subtraction: 6
```

**Player 2's Turn:**

```
Current N: 6
Proper divisors of 6 (excluding 1 and 6): 2, 3
Enter the divisor to subtract: 2
New N after subtraction: 4
```

**Player 1's Turn:**

```
Current N: 4
Proper divisors of 4 (excluding 1 and 4): 2
Enter the divisor to subtract: 2
New N after subtraction: 2
```

**Player 2's Turn:**

```
Current N: 2
Proper divisors of 2 (excluding 1 and 2): None
No valid moves. N is prime.
Player 2 cannot make a move. Player 1 wins!
```

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the results of your subtraction to avoid leaving a prime number for your opponent.
- **Force Primes:**
  - Try to reduce N to a prime number on your opponent's turn, ensuring they cannot make a move.
- **Divisor Choices:**
  - Larger divisors reduce N quickly but may give the advantage to your opponent. Balance your choices wisely.
- **Know Your Numbers:**
  - Familiarity with divisibility and prime numbers enhances strategic options.
