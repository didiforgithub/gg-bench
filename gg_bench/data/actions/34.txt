The action space indices in the gym environment correspond directly to the positions on the number line, where each index represents a number from 1 to 21. Specifically, an action with index `i` (ranging from 0 to 20) maps to selecting the number `i + 1` on the number line. This index is used to determine which number the current player will claim during their turn.
