# Game Title: Double or Nothing

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the exact target number **31** by applying allowed operations to a shared cumulative number. Players take turns performing operations to the cumulative number, aiming to be the player who reaches the target number exactly.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared cumulative number set to **1**.
- **Target Number**: The goal is to reach the cumulative number **31**.
- **Players**: Two players participate, taking turns alternately.

---

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Number**: A shared number that starts at **1** and is modified by players during their turns.
- **Allowed Operations**:
  - **Double**: Multiply the cumulative number by 2.
  - **Add One**: Add 1 to the cumulative number.

---

## Turns

1. **Determine the First Player**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Player's Turn**:
     - The player is informed of the current cumulative number.
     - The player chooses one of the allowed operations.
     - The chosen operation is applied to the cumulative number.
     - The updated cumulative number is announced.
   - **Turn Progression**: Turns alternate between the two players until the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Allowed Operations

- **Double**:
  - Multiply the cumulative number by 2.
  - Example: If the cumulative number is 5, doubling results in 10.
- **Add One**:
  - Add 1 to the cumulative number.
  - Example: If the cumulative number is 5, adding one results in 6.

### Valid Moves

- **Within Target**: The resulting cumulative number must **not exceed** the target number (31).
- **No Moves Available**: If both operations would result in exceeding the target number, the player **cannot make a valid move** and loses the game.

### Winning the Game

- **Exact Match**: The player whose move results in the cumulative number being exactly **31** wins the game.
- **Forced Loss**: If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose, and the other player wins.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winner is the player who reaches the target number of 31 or who forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **No Point System**: There is no point accumulation. Each game results in a win or loss.
