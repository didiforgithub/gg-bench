The action space indices in this environment directly map to possible game moves, with each index representing a distinct positive integer from 0 to MAX_NUMBER. In the context of the game, valid moves are positive integers greater than 1 that meet specific criteria based on the game's rules. Therefore, when a player selects an index as their action, it corresponds to choosing that integer as their move, provided it hasn't been used and satisfies the game's conditions with respect to the previous number in the chain. This direct mapping allows players to select integers by specifying their index in the predefined range.
