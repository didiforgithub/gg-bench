In the game environment, each action space index corresponds to a unique combination of bit positions to flip, ranging from 1 to 3 bits selected from positions 0 to 7 (representing bit positions 1 to 8 in a byte). The action list is generated by enumerating all possible combinations of these bit positions. The total number of possible actions is 92, covering every way 1, 2, or 3 bits can be flipped within an 8-bit byte. Each index in the action space directly maps to one specific combination of positions in this list, with the indices and actions consistently aligned such that executing an action flips the bits at the specified indices in the byte.
