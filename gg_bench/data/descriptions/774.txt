# **Last Digit Duel**

## **Objective**

The primary goal of **Last Digit Duel** is to be the player who multiplies the shared number to produce a result that ends with the digit **0**. Players achieve victory by strategically choosing multipliers to steer the shared number towards ending with zero. The first player to make the shared number end with the digit **0** wins the game. A loss occurs when a player fails to prevent their opponent from achieving this objective on their subsequent turn.

## **Setup**

1. **Shared Number Initialization**: The game begins with a shared number set to **1**.
2. **Player Designation**: Determine which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be decided by a coin toss, random number generation, or mutual agreement.

## **Game Components**

- **Shared Number**: A single integer value that both players manipulate. It starts at **1** and changes with each turn based on player actions.
- **Multipliers**: Players use integers from **2** to **9** as multipliers during their turns.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen multipliers.

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
2. **Player Action**:
   - On their turn, a player selects a multiplier (an integer between **2** and **9**, inclusive).
   - The player multiplies the shared number by their chosen multiplier.
   - The shared number is then updated to this new value.
3. **Progression**:
   - The updated shared number carries over to the next player's turn.
   - The game continues with players alternating turns and selecting multipliers.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Multipliers**:
   - Players must choose an integer multiplier between **2** and **9** on each turn.
   - Multipliers cannot be outside this range.
2. **Shared Number Update**:
   - The shared number is updated immediately after a player multiplies it by their chosen multiplier.
   - The new shared number becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.
3. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins if, after their turn, the shared number ends with the digit **0**.
4. **Strategic Play**:
   - Players must anticipate their opponent's potential moves.
   - The game requires strategic selection of multipliers to either move towards ending with zero or to prevent the opponent from doing so.
5. **No Draws**:
   - The game continues until a player wins by making the shared number end with zero.
   - There is no possibility of a draw.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory**: The player who causes the shared number to end with the digit **0** wins the game.
- **No Point Accumulation**: There is no point system; the game is won by meeting the winning condition.
- **Tracking**: The shared number progression serves as the game's state and is tracked throughout.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game Play**

**Starting Shared Number**: 1

**Turn 1**:  
- **Player 1's Turn**  
- Chooses multiplier: **5**  
- Calculation: 1 × 5 = **5**  
- **Shared Number** is now **5**

**Turn 2**:  
- **Player 2's Turn**  
- Chooses multiplier: **2**  
- Calculation: 5 × 2 = **10**  
- **Shared Number** is now **10**  
- Since the shared number ends with **0**, **Player 2 wins the game**

### **Strategic Gameplay Illustration**

**Starting Shared Number**: 1

**Turn 1**:  
- **Player 1's Turn**  
- Chooses multiplier: **3**  
- Calculation: 1 × 3 = **3**  
- **Shared Number** is now **3**

**Turn 2**:  
- **Player 2's Turn**  
- Chooses multiplier: **7**  
- Calculation: 3 × 7 = **21**  
- **Shared Number** is now **21**

**Turn 3**:  
- **Player 1's Turn**  
- Chooses multiplier: **4**  
- Calculation: 21 × 4 = **84**  
- **Shared Number** is now **84**

**Turn 4**:  
- **Player 2's Turn**  
- Chooses multiplier: **5**  
- Calculation: 84 × 5 = **420**  
- **Shared Number** is now **420**  
- Since the shared number ends with **0**, **Player 2 wins the game**

### **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

**Game Start**

```
Shared Number is 1
Player 1's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 6
Shared Number is now 6

Player 2's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 7
Shared Number is now 42

Player 1's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 5
Shared Number is now 210

Player 1 wins! The shared number ends with 0.
```

### **Longer Gameplay Example**

**Game Start**

```
Shared Number is 1
Player 1's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
Shared Number is now 2

Player 2's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 3
Shared Number is now 6

Player 1's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 7
Shared Number is now 42

Player 2's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
Shared Number is now 84

Player 1's turn.
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 5
Shared Number is now 420

Player 1 wins! The shared number ends with 0.
```

## **Strategic Considerations**

- **Multipliers Ending with 5 or Even Numbers**: Multiplying by 5 or an even number can be strategic since numbers ending with 0 are multiples of 10.
- **Avoiding Immediate Loss**: Players should be cautious not to set up the shared number in a way that allows the opponent to win on their next turn.
- **Predicting Outcomes**: Skilled players will calculate future possibilities based on current shared number and available multipliers.

## **Summary**

**Last Digit Duel** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to manipulate a shared number through multiplication with the aim of ending the number with zero. It requires foresight and planning to outmaneuver the opponent and secure a win. The game's simplicity makes it easy to code and play in a command-line interface while offering depth for skilled strategic play.
