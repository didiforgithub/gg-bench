In the game, the action space consists of two discrete actions, represented by indices:

- **Action Index 0**: Corresponds to moving the marker one space toward the player's goal. For Player 1, this means moving the marker to the left (decreasing the position). For Player 2, this means moving the marker to the right (increasing the position).

- **Action Index 1**: Corresponds to moving the marker one space away from the player's goal. For Player 1, this means moving the marker to the right (increasing the position). For Player 2, this means moving the marker to the left (decreasing the position).
