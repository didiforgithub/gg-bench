# Game Title: Number Snatch

## Objective

Be the player with the **highest total sum** of captured numbers at the end of the game by strategically selecting numbers from a shared sequence.

## Setup

- An ordered sequence of consecutive positive integers is laid out horizontally.
- For example, the numbers from **1 to 21** are arranged in a line from left to right.
- The sequence is visible to both players.

## Game Components

- **Number Sequence**: A consecutive sequence of positive integers (e.g., 1 to 21).
- **Player Scores**: Each player has a running total of the numbers they have captured.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.
- On each turn, a player must select and remove one number from the sequence.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Selecting Numbers

- On your turn, you may choose to capture either the **first** (leftmost) or the **last** (rightmost) number remaining in the sequence.
- The chosen number is **added to your total score**.
- The number is then **removed** from the sequence, shortening it accordingly.

### 2. Game Progression

- The sequence shrinks as numbers are removed from either end.
- Play continues with players alternately selecting numbers from the updated sequence.

### 3. End of Game

- The game ends when **all numbers have been captured**, and there are no more numbers left in the sequence.

### 4. Winning the Game

- The player with the **highest total score** (sum of their captured numbers) at the end of the game **wins**.
- There is no possibility of a draw since the total sum of numbers is known and players alternate turns.

## Scoring

- Each player's score is the sum of the numbers they have captured during the game.
- Scores are tracked throughout the game and totaled at the end to determine the winner.

## Strategic Tips

- **Look Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice will affect the sequence.
- **Denying Options**: Sometimes it's beneficial to select a number that prevents your opponent from accessing higher numbers on their next turn.
- **Balance Immediate Gain vs. Future Advantage**: Taking the highest number might not always be the best move if it allows your opponent to capture even higher totals subsequently.
- **Keep Track of Sums**: Be aware of the total remaining points in the sequence to make informed decisions.

## Conclusion

"Number Snatch" is a game of strategic planning, foresight, and simple arithmetic. By carefully choosing numbers and anticipating your opponent's moves, you can maximize your total score and secure victory.
