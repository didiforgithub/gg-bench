In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 9, corresponding directly to the numbers a player can select from the number pool. Each index maps to a number as follows: index 0 is mapped to the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, and so on up to index 9, which is mapped to the number 10. Therefore, the player's action of selecting an index results in the selection of the number that is one greater than the action index.
