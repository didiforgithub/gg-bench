In the game, each cell on the 5x5 grid is uniquely identified by its row and column. The action space indices, ranging from 0 to 24, correspond directly to these cells in a row-major order. Specifically, index `action` maps to the cell at row `action // 5 + 1` (integer division) and column `action % 5 + 1` (remainder). For example, index 0 maps to cell (1,1), index 1 to cell (1,2), continuing sequentially, and index 24 maps to cell (5,5).
