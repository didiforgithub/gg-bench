In the provided `Divisor Duel` gym environment implementation, the action space is defined as a `Discrete` space with indices ranging from `0` to `self.starting_number` (inclusive). However, in the context of the game, valid moves correspond to the proper divisors of the current number, which are only those integers greater than `1` and less than the current number. The mapping between action space indices and game moves involves the following: during a player's turn, the player selects an index (action) corresponding to one of the identified valid proper divisors for the current number. This selection effectively divides the current number by this chosen divisor, which yields a new current number and continues the game. Therefore, while the raw action indices range broadly, only a subset representing valid proper divisors is meaningful for gameplay.
