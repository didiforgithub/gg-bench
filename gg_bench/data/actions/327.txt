In the game, the action space indices correspond to the numbers 1 to 5 that a player can choose:

- Action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1.
- Action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2.
- Action index 2 corresponds to selecting the number 3.
- Action index 3 corresponds to selecting the number 4.
- Action index 4 corresponds to selecting the number 5.

These mappings allow the players to pick their moves using these indices within the defined action space.
