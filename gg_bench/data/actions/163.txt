The action space in the `CustomEnv` is defined as a discrete space with a number of actions equal to the number of prime numbers generated up to `N=2000`. Each action corresponds to an index in this list of prime numbers, where each index represents a specific prime number. This mapping is achieved through two dictionaries: `index_to_prime`, which maps an index to its corresponding prime number, and `prime_to_index`, which maps a prime number to its index. When a player selects an action, the index is used to look up and select the corresponding prime number from the `index_to_prime` dictionary. This approach efficiently manages actions by directly correlating them with available prime moves in the game.
