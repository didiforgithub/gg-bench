# **Blockade**

## **Objective**

The objective of **Blockade** is to be the first player to prevent your opponent from making any valid moves. Players achieve victory by strategically placing their symbols on a grid to limit the opponent's options until they have no legal moves left.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Game Grid:** Prepare a 5x5 grid representing the game board. Each cell in the grid is identified by its row and column numbers, ranging from 1 to 5. The grid is initially empty.

2. **Player Symbols:**
   - **Player 1:** Uses the symbol `X`.
   - **Player 2:** Uses the symbol `O`.

3. **Starting Conditions:** Decide which player will make the first move (Player 1 by default).

---

## **Game Components**

- **Grid Cells (25):** Each cell can be in one of three states:
  - **Empty (`.`):** The cell is unoccupied.
  - **Occupied by Player 1 (`X`):** The cell contains Player 1's symbol.
  - **Occupied by Player 2 (`O`):** The cell contains Player 2's symbol.

- **Player Symbols:**
  - **`X`:** Represents Player 1.
  - **`O`:** Represents Player 2.

- **Game Grid Visualization:**

  ```
  (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (1,5)
  (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4) (2,5)
  (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4) (3,5)
  (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4) (4,5)
  (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5)
  ```

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1 unless otherwise decided.

2. **Player Actions on Their Turn:**
   - **Place Symbol:** Place your symbol (`X` or `O`) on one valid empty cell following the placement rules.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - After placing a symbol, the turn passes to the opponent.
   - The game continues until one player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **Placement Rules:**

1. **First Move:**
   - The first player can place their symbol on **any** empty cell on the grid.

2. **Subsequent Moves:**
   - A player must place their symbol on an empty cell that is **adjacent** (up, down, left, or right) to a cell **most recently** occupied by the opponent.
   - Diagonal adjacency is **not** considered valid.

3. **Valid Cells for Placement:**
   - A cell is valid if it is empty and directly adjacent to the opponent's last placed symbol.
   - If there are multiple valid cells, the player can choose any one of them.

### **Movement Restrictions:**

- **Occupied Cells:** Players cannot place their symbol on a cell that is already occupied by any symbol.
- **No Valid Moves:** If a player has no valid cells to place their symbol (i.e., no empty cells adjacent to the opponent's last move), they lose the game.

---

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game:** The player who successfully blocks their opponent, leaving them with no valid moves on their turn, wins the game.
- **No Points System:** There is no point scoring; the game is won by achieving the objective.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite grid size and placement rules.

### **Conclusion**

- **Winner:** Player 1 wins the game as Player 2 cannot make a valid move.
- **Game End Condition:** Player 2 has no empty adjacent cells to the last symbol placed by Player 1 at (5,1).

---

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Control the Center:** Early in the game, controlling central positions can offer more adjacent cells for future moves.
- **Limit Opponent's Options:** Place your symbols to reduce the number of valid adjacent cells available to your opponent on their next turn.
- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate your opponent's possible moves and aim to force them into positions with fewer subsequent options.
- **Edge and Corner Cells:** Be cautious when playing on the edges and corners as they have fewer adjacent cells, which can be advantageous or limiting depending on the situation.

## **Command-Line Interaction Example**

### **Notation:**

- Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 5.
- Input format for placing a symbol: `row column` (e.g., `3 3`).

### **Sample Turn Interaction:**

#### **Player 1's Turn:**

```
Player 1 (X), enter your move (row column): 3 3
```

- Player 1 inputs: `3 3`
- The game updates the grid and displays it.

#### **Player 2's Turn:**

```
Player 2 (O), possible moves adjacent to (3,3):
(2,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,4)
Enter your move (row column): 3 2
```

- Player 2 inputs: `3 2`
- The game updates and displays the grid.
