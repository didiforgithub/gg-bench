# Score Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly 50 points** or strategically force your opponent to exceed 50 and reset their score, thereby gaining an advantage. Use tactical decisions to manage both your score and your opponent's score to achieve victory.

## Setup

- Both players start the game with a score of **25 points**.
- Determine which player goes first (e.g., by a coin toss or mutual agreement).
- Ensure access to a method for simulating a six-sided die roll (numbers 1 through 6), such as a random number generator.

## Game Components

- **Player Scores**: Each player has a personal score, starting at 25.
- **Six-Sided Die**: Simulated using random number generation to produce integers from 1 to 6.
- **Score Tracker**: A simple display or variables to keep track of both players' scores.

## Turns

- Players take turns in a back-and-forth sequence.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Roll the Die**: The current player generates a random number between 1 and 6.
  2. **Assign Points**: The player decides to add the rolled number to either their own score or their opponent's score.
  3. **Update Scores**: Adjust the chosen player's score according to the assigned points.
  4. **Check for Win or Reset**: Determine if any scores have reached 50 or exceeded it and act accordingly.
  5. **End Turn**: The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Rolling the Die

- Use a random number generator to simulate rolling a six-sided die.
- The result will be an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive.

### Assigning Points

- After rolling, the current player must choose to add the rolled number to **either**:
  - **Their own score**, or
  - **Their opponent's score**.

### Scoring

- **Reaching 50 Points**:
  - If a player's score reaches **exactly 50** after points are assigned, that player **wins** the game immediately.
- **Exceeding 50 Points**:
  - If adding points causes a player's score to exceed 50 (i.e., 51 or more), their score is **reset to 25**.
  - This rule applies to both players, regardless of who assigned the points.

### Strategic Considerations

- Players must decide whether to boost their own score or hinder their opponent's progress.
- Assigning points to the opponent may force them to exceed 50 and reset, providing a strategic advantage.
- Careful calculation and anticipation of potential future rolls can influence the decision-making process.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**:
  - Be the first to reach exactly 50 points.
- **Reset Condition**:
  - If a player's score exceeds 50, reset their score to 25.
