The action space indices in the gym environment map to the possible moves in the game by representing the integers from 1 to 6 as indices 0 to 5. Each index corresponds to the number chosen for addition to the player's total:

- Action index 0 maps to the number 1.
- Action index 1 maps to the number 2.
- Action index 2 maps to the number 3.
- Action index 3 maps to the number 4.
- Action index 4 maps to the number 5.
- Action index 5 maps to the number 6.

This mapping allows players to select a move (number) by specifying an action index within the range [0, 5].
