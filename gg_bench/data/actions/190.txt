In the GridLock game gym environment, the action space is represented by a single discrete set of 25 possible actions, corresponding to each cell in the 5x5 grid. The indices range from 0 to 24, where each index directly maps to a cell on the grid in a row-major order. This means:

- Index 0 corresponds to the top-left cell (row 1, column 1).
- Index 24 corresponds to the bottom-right cell (row 5, column 5).
- Generally, for any index `i`, it maps to the cell located at row `(i // 5) + 1` and column `(i % 5) + 1` on the grid.
