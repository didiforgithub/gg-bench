The action space indices in the gym environment correspond to the available multipliers in the game. Each index from 0 to 7 maps directly to a multiplier from 2 to 9, respectively. Thus, action index 0 corresponds to multiplying by 2, index 1 to multiplying by 3, and so on, up to action index 7, which corresponds to multiplying by 9. This mapping allows players to choose their multiplier by selecting the corresponding action index in the environment.
