In the CustomEnv gym environment for Parity War, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(15)`, representing the numbers 1 through 15 in the game. The action indices range from 0 to 14. When a player selects an action, it is mapped to a game move by adding 1 to the action index. Thus, an action index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `1`, an action index `1` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, and so on, up to an action index `14` corresponding to selecting the number `15`.
