In the environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 possible actions, corresponding to selecting numbers from 1 to 9. The mapping is straightforward: action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9. This mapping allows players to choose a number by specifying its zero-based index in the action space.
