In the game environment, the action space consists of 40 discrete actions indexed from 0 to 39, representing two types of moves:

1. **Guessing the Opponent's Number (Indices 0-19)**: 
   - Each index corresponds to a guess of the opponent’s secret number, from 1 to 20.
   - Index 0 corresponds to guessing 1, index 1 to guessing 2, and so forth up to index 19, which corresponds to guessing 20.

2. **Asking a Question (Indices 20-39)**:
   - Each index represents a predefined yes-or-no question about the opponent’s secret number.
   - Index 20 corresponds to question 0 ("Is your number greater than 10?"), index 21 to question 1 ("Is your number even?"), and so forth up to index 39, which corresponds to question 19 ("Is your number greater than 11?").
