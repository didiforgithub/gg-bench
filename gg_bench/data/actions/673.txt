The action space consists of 33 discrete actions, structured as follows:

1. **Movement Actions (0-7)**: These represent the agent's movement to adjacent cells, mapped to directions:
   - 0: NW (North-West)
   - 1: N  (North)
   - 2: NE (North-East)
   - 3: W  (West)
   - 4: E  (East)
   - 5: SW (South-West)
   - 6: S  (South)
   - 7: SE (South-East)

2. **Trap Placement Actions (8-32)**: These correspond to placing a trap in one of the 25 grid cells (excluding flags, occupied cells, and previously trapped positions). Each action number from 8 onwards directly maps to its respective cell index in a 1D flattened representation of the 5x5 grid.
