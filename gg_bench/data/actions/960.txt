The action space indices are mapped to possible moves (divisors) in the game by adding 2 to the action index. Since the smallest valid divisor is 2, the action index 0 corresponds to the divisor 2, action index 1 corresponds to the divisor 3, and so on. This mapping ensures that action index `i` corresponds to divisor `i + 2`. The range of indices is from 0 to `max_divisor - 2`, allowing for all potential divisors from 2 up to `max_divisor`.
