## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection:**
   - You must choose a number that is still available in the pool.

2. **Actions:**
   - **Attack:**
     - Deal damage to your opponent equal to the **full value** of the selected number.
     - Example: If you choose **7** to attack, your opponent loses **7 HP**.
   - **Defend:**
     - Increase your own HP by **half** of the selected number's value (**rounded down** if necessary).
     - Example: If you choose **5** to defend, you gain **2 HP** (since 5 รท 2 = 2.5, rounded down to 2).
3. **Health Points (HP):**
   - A player's HP cannot exceed **10 HP**.
   - If a player's HP drops to **0 or below**, they lose the game.

6. **No Skipping Numbers:**
   - Players **cannot pass** their turn unless there are no numbers available.
