In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space indices correspond directly to the numbers in the game. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, meaning there are 9 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 8. Each index represents the action of selecting the number at that position plus one: index 0 corresponds to picking number 1, index 1 to picking number 2, continuing up to index 8, which corresponds to picking number 9. When a player takes an action, it selects the number associated with that action index from the shared pool.
