In the game, the action space indices map to the moves as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the "Pass" action, used when no valid factors exist.
- Indices 1 through 8 represent selecting factors 2 through 9, respectively. For example, index 1 represents choosing factor 2, index 2 represents choosing factor 3, and so on up to index 8, representing factor 9.
