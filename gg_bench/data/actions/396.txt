In the game environment, the action space consists of indices from 0 to 9, where each index corresponds to the following moves:

- Indices 0-8: Capture the crystal with a value equal to the index plus one (i.e., index 0 captures crystal 1, index 1 captures crystal 2, ..., index 8 captures crystal 9).
- Index 9: Pass the turn without capturing any crystal if no valid moves are available.
