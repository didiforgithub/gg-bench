In the gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which corresponds to selecting a number between 1 and 9. The indices in the action space (0 to 8) map to these numbers directly by adding 1 (since Python uses zero-based indexing). Therefore, an action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9.
