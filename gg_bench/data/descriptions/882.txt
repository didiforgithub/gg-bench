# Line Battle: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

The goal of **Line Battle** is to be the player who brings the two opposing markers to meet at the same position on a linear track. Players take turns moving the markers towards each other, and the first player to move a marker such that both markers occupy the same position wins the game.

## Setup

- **Game Board**: A linear track consisting of 7 sequentially numbered positions from **1** to **7**.
- **Markers**:
  - **Marker A**: Starts at position **1**.
  - **Marker B**: Starts at position **7**.
- Both players can see the positions of the markers at all times.

## Game Components

- **Linear Track**: Represents the game board with positions numbered from 1 to 7.
- **Markers**:
  - **Marker A**: Represents one player's piece, initially placed at position 1.
  - **Marker B**: Represents the other player's piece, initially placed at position 7.
- **Positions**:
  - Numbered slots from **1** to **7** where markers can be placed.
- The game can be represented in the command line using numbers and letters to indicate positions and markers.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **On a Player's Turn**:
  - Choose one of the markers (**A** or **B**) to move.
  - Move the selected marker **one position closer** to the opposing marker.
- **Turn Order**:
  - **Player 1** moves first.
  - **Player 2** moves second.
- **Turn Actions**:
  - Only one marker can be moved per turn.
  - Markers can only move towards each other (towards the center of the track).

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Marker Movement**:
   - A marker can only move to an **adjacent position** closer to the opposing marker.
   - Markers cannot skip positions or move away from the opposing marker.
2. **Markers Cannot Pass**:
   - Markers cannot pass over or bypass each other.
   - Once markers are adjacent (next to each other), the only possible moves are into the unoccupied position between them.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who moves a marker into the position occupied by the opposing marker wins the game.
   - This occurs when both markers occupy the **same position** after a move.
4. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player wins.
   - There are no draws or ties.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who successfully moves a marker to meet the opposing marker in the same position wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no point accumulation; the outcome is a win or loss.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the mechanics of movement.
