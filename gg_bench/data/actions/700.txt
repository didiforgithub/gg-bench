In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined with 6 discrete actions represented by indices. These indices map to game moves as follows:

- Index 0: Move the player's piece one cell forward toward the opponent's starting cell.
- Indices 1 to 5: Place a block (#) on Cells 1 to 5 respectively (i.e., Index 1 places a block on Cell 1, Index 2 on Cell 2, and so on).
