In the game, the action space indices represent the territories a player can choose to claim. The action space is discrete with values ranging from 0 to 6, corresponding directly to the seven territories on the map, numbered from 1 to 7. An index value of 0 in the action space refers to territory 1, an index value of 1 refers to territory 2, and so forth, up to an index value of 6 which refers to territory 7. Players select an action index to claim the associated territory on their turn.
