In the provided gym environment for Divisor Duel, the action space consists of 100 discrete actions, ranging from 0 to 99. These action indices are mapped to possible moves by adding 1 to the index value, thus representing divisors from 1 to 100. For instance, an action index of 0 corresponds to choosing the divisor 1, an action index of 1 corresponds to choosing the divisor 2, and so on up to an action index of 99, which corresponds to the divisor 100. This mapping allows players to select and subtract a proper divisor from the Current Number during their turn.
