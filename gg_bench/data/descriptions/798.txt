**Trap Runner**

---

### **Objective**

In **Trap Runner**, two players take on opposing roles: the **Runner** and the **Trapper**. The **Runner's** goal is to traverse a linear path of 10 cells, moving from the starting point (cell 0) to the finish line (cell 10) without stepping on hidden traps. The **Trapper's** objective is to strategically place traps along the path to stop the **Runner** from reaching the finish line. The game concludes when either the **Runner** successfully reaches cell 10 (resulting in a win for the **Runner**) or steps on a trap (resulting in a win for the **Trapper**).

---

### **Setup**

1. **Roles**: Assign roles randomly or by mutual agreement. One player becomes the **Runner**, and the other becomes the **Trapper**.

2. **Path Initialization**: 

   - Represent the path as a sequence of cells numbered from **1** to **10**.
   - The **Runner** starts off the path at **cell 0**.

3. **Trap Placement**:

   - The **Trapper** has **3 traps** to place.
   - **Before the game begins**, the **Trapper** secretly selects **3 distinct cells** between **1** and **10** to place the traps.
   - The trap locations are kept hidden from the **Runner**.

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Path Cells (1-10)**:

   - Represented numerically from **1** to **10**.
   - Each cell may contain a trap (unknown to the **Runner**) or be safe.

2. **Traps**:

   - The **Trapper** has **3 traps**.
   - Traps are invisible to the **Runner** until they land on a trapped cell.

3. **Player Tokens** (Optional for visualization):

   - A token to represent the **Runner's** current position on the path.

---

### **Turns**

The game proceeds in a series of turns, starting with the **Runner**:

1. **Runner's Turn**:

   - The **Runner** decides how many cells to move forward: **1**, **2**, or **3**.
   - The **Runner** declares their chosen movement and advances their position accordingly.
   - If the **Runner** lands on a cell with a trap, the turn ends immediately, and the **Runner** loses.

2. **Trapper's Turn**:

   - The **Trapper** waits for the **Runner's** move.
   - After the **Runner** moves, if they have not stepped on a trap, the **Trapper** indicates that the **Runner** is safe.

3. **Turn Progression**:

   - Turns repeat with the **Runner** moving each time until the game ends.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Movement Rules for the Runner**:

   - On each turn, the **Runner** must move forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** cells.
   - The **Runner** cannot skip a turn or move backward.
   - The **Runner** must declare their move before advancing.

2. **Trap Activation**:

   - If the **Runner** lands on a cell containing a trap, the **Trapper** reveals the trap.
   - The game ends immediately with the **Trapper** winning.

3. **Winning Conditions**:

   - **Runner Wins**: If the **Runner** reaches **cell 10** without landing on a trap.
   - **Trapper Wins**: If the **Runner** lands on any of the trapped cells.

4. **Path Boundaries**:

   - The **Runner** cannot move beyond **cell 10**.
   - If the **Runner's** declared move would take them past **cell 10**, they must adjust their move to land exactly on **cell 10**.

5. **Traps**:

   - Traps remain hidden until activated.
   - The **Trapper** cannot change trap locations once the game begins.

6. **Information Disclosure**:

   - The **Trapper** does not provide any hints or clues about trap positions.
   - The **Runner** relies on strategy and intuition to avoid traps.

### **Scoring**

**Trap Runner** is typically played in rounds, with players alternating roles between the **Runner** and the **Trapper**. After both players have played each role, they can compare results:

- **Single Round Win**: Determined by the outcome of the round (either the **Runner** or **Trapper** wins).
- **Match Win**:

  - Players can agree on playing a set number of rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of rounds each player wins as the **Runner** and the **Trapper**.
  - The player with the most wins after all rounds is the overall winner.

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Runner**:

  - Vary your movement distances to avoid predictable patterns.
  - Consider the probability of traps being placed on certain cells based on common strategies.
  - Remember that you cannot overshoot cell 10; plan your moves to land exactly on the finish line.

- **Trapper**:

  - Place traps on cells that are likely to be landed on based on typical movement choices (e.g., cells 3, 6, 9 if runners often move in increments of 3).
  - Avoid obvious trap placements; consider placing traps on less predictable cells.
  - Use psychological strategies to anticipate the **Runner's** decisions.
