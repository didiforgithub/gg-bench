In the game, the action space indices are mapped directly to the possible number of steps a player can take:

- Index `0` corresponds to moving `1` step forward.
- Index `1` corresponds to moving `2` steps forward.
- Index `2` corresponds to moving `3` steps forward.

These indices essentially represent choices for movement distance, allowing players to decide how far to advance towards the flag.
