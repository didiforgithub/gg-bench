# Double or Add: The Race to 31

## Objective

"Double or Add" is a two-player turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly 31** by strategically choosing to either double the current number or add one to it on your turn. Exercising foresight and planning, players aim to force their opponent into a position where they cannot avoid surpassing 31, thus securing their own victory.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with the number **1**.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (can be random or predetermined).

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that starts at **1** and changes based on player actions.
- **Operations**:
  - **Double**: Multiply the current number by 2.
  - **Add One**: Increase the current number by 1.
  
No physical pieces, boards, or cards are required—only the ability to perform simple arithmetic and input choices via the command line.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display the Current Number**: At the beginning of each turn, the current number is shown to both players.
  2. **Player's Choice**: The active player chooses to either:
     - **Double** the current number, or
     - **Add One** to the current number.
  3. **Update the Current Number**: The chosen operation is applied, and the new current number is announced.
  4. **Check for Victory**: Determine if the current number is exactly 31 or if a player has exceeded 31.
  5. **Proceed to Next Turn**: If the game has not ended, the next player takes their turn following the same structure.

- **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until the game concludes.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Legal Moves**:
   - On your turn, you **must** choose one of the following actions:
     - **Double**: Multiply the current number by 2.
     - **Add One**: Add 1 to the current number.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player makes a move that results in the current number being **exactly 31**, that player **wins** the game immediately.

3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's move causes the current number to exceed 31 (i.e., the current number becomes **32 or higher**), that player **loses** the game immediately.

4. **Mandatory Actions**:
   - Players **cannot** skip a turn.
   - Players **must** choose one of the two legal moves on their turn.

5. **Valid Number Range**:
   - The current number will always be a positive integer greater than zero throughout the game.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw; it will always result in a win for one player and a loss for the other.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieving a current number of exactly 31 on your turn.
- **Defeat**: Causing the current number to exceed 31 on your turn.
- **Tracking**: No points are accumulated; the game is a win-or-lose match based on reaching the target number.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Initial State**:
- Current Number: 1

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1's Turn**

- Calculation: 4 × 2 = 8
- New Current Number: 8

**Turn 4**:
- **Player 2's Turn**
- Current Number: 8
- Player 2 chooses to **Add One**.
- Calculation: 8 + 1 = 9
- New Current Number: 9

**Turn 5**:
- **Player 1's Turn**
- Current Number: 9
- Player 1 chooses to **Double**.
- Calculation: 9 × 2 = 18
- New Current Number: 18

**Turn 6**:
- **Player 2's Turn**
- Current Number: 18
- Player 2 chooses to **Double**.
- Calculation: 18 × 2 = 36
- New Current Number: 36

**Outcome**:
- Since the current number (**36**) exceeds 31, **Player 2 loses** the game.
- **Player 1 wins**.
