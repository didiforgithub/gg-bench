In the gym environment for "Odd and Even Duel," the action space indices (0 to 9) correspond to the possible number selections (1 to 10) in the game. To map an action index to a game move, the index is incremented by 1. This means action index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, and so on, up to index 9 mapping to the number 10. This mapping enables players to choose a number within the allowed range during their turn by selecting the corresponding action index.
