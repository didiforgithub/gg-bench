# Divider Game Rule Book

## Objective

The **Divider Game** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal of the game is to be the player who reduces the shared total to **exactly zero**, thereby forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Victory is achieved by skillfully selecting numbers that divide the current total, strategically planning ahead to outmaneuver your opponent.

## Setup

1. **Initial Total**: The game starts with a shared total number, typically **100**, but any positive integer greater than 1 can be used to vary the game's length and difficulty.
2. **Player Order**: Determine which player goes first. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Total Number**: A shared integer value that both players will manipulate throughout the game. It starts at the initial total (e.g., 100) and decreases as players subtract numbers from it.
- **Divisors**: Positive integers less than the current total that divide evenly into the current total.
  
  - **Example**: If the current total is 50, the valid divisors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 (excluding the total itself).

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players take turns alternately.
   - On their turn, a player must perform the following actions:
     - **Select a Number**: Choose a valid positive integer divisor of the current total, excluding the total itself.
     - **Subtract the Number**: Reduce the current total by the chosen number.
2. **Progression of Turns**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player cannot make a valid move.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you must **subtract a positive integer** that is:
     - A **divisor** of the current total (it divides evenly into the total with no remainder).
     - **Less than** the current total (you cannot subtract the total itself).
2. **Subtracting the Number**:
   - Update the current total by subtracting the chosen number:
     - `New Total = Current Total - Chosen Number`
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends when the current total reaches **zero**, and the player who made the last valid move **wins**.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If it's your turn and there are **no valid divisors** to subtract (i.e., the only divisor is the total itself), you **lose** the game.

### Additional Mechanics

- **No Reuse Limitation**:
  - Numbers can be reused if they are valid divisors of the current total on a player's turn.
- **Mandatory Moves**:
  - If a player has a valid move, they must make it. Passing or skipping a turn is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winning player is the one who reduces the total to zero on their turn, leaving the opponent without a valid move.
- **No Draws**: The game is designed with no draw mechanism; every game will result in a win or loss.

## Examples

### Sample Game Playthrough

#### Starting Conditions

- **Initial Total**: 100
- **Player 1**: Starts first.

#### Turn-by-Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 100
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 100): 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
   - **Chosen Number**: 25
   - **New Total**: 100 - 25 = 75
   - **Explanation**: 25 divides evenly into 100 (100 ÷ 25 = 4).

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 75
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 75): 1, 3, 5, 15, 25
   - **Chosen Number**: 25
   - **New Total**: 75 - 25 = 50
   - **Explanation**: 25 divides evenly into 75 (75 ÷ 25 = 3).

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 50
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 50): 1, 2, 5, 10, 25
   - **Chosen Number**: 10
   - **New Total**: 50 - 10 = 40
   - **Explanation**: 10 divides evenly into 50 (50 ÷ 10 = 5).

4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 40
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 40): 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20
   - **Chosen Number**: 20
   - **New Total**: 40 - 20 = 20
   - **Explanation**: 20 divides evenly into 40 (40 ÷ 20 = 2).

5. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 20
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 20): 1, 2, 4, 5, 10
   - **Chosen Number**: 10
   - **New Total**: 20 - 10 = 10
   - **Explanation**: 10 divides evenly into 20 (20 ÷ 10 = 2).

6. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 10
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 10): 1, 2, 5
   - **Chosen Number**: 5
   - **New Total**: 10 - 5 = 5
   - **Explanation**: 5 divides evenly into 10 (10 ÷ 5 = 2).

7. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 5
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 5): 1
   - **Chosen Number**: 1
   - **New Total**: 5 - 1 = 4
   - **Explanation**: 1 divides evenly into 5.

8. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 4
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 4): 1, 2
   - **Chosen Number**: 2
   - **New Total**: 4 - 2 = 2
   - **Explanation**: 2 divides evenly into 4 (4 ÷ 2 = 2).

9. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current Total**: 2
   - **Valid Divisors** (excluding 2): 1
   - **Chosen Number**: 1
   - **New Total**: 2 - 1 = 1
   - **Explanation**: 1 divides evenly into 2.

10. **Player 2's Turn**
    - **Current Total**: 1
    - **Valid Divisors**: None (since 1 only divides by 1, and subtracting the total itself is not allowed).
    - **Outcome**: Player 2 has no valid moves and **loses**.

#### Winner

- **Player 1** wins by reducing the total to 1 and leaving Player 2 without a valid move.

```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the divisors of future totals.
- **Control the Totals**: Aim to leave totals that have limited divisors, forcing your opponent into difficult positions.
- **Avoid Leaving 1**: Reducing the total to 1 on your turn typically forces a win, as your opponent will have no valid moves.
