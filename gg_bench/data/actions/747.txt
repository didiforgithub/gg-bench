In the Digit Duel gym environment, the action space indices correspond to choosing one of the three possible digits from the current player's number to use for subtraction. Specifically:

- **Action 0**: Select the hundreds digit (leftmost digit).
- **Action 1**: Select the tens digit (middle digit).
- **Action 2**: Select the ones digit (rightmost digit).

The chosen digit's value is used to subtract from the opponent's number, and the digit in the player's own number is then decremented by 1.
