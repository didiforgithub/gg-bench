In the game's environment, the action space consists of 18 discrete actions, where each pair of consecutive indices represents the possibility to either add or subtract one of the numbers (1 to 9). The action index is divided by 2 to determine the number to use, and the remainder reveals the operation: an even index indicates adding the number, while an odd index indicates subtracting it. For instance, action index 0 corresponds to adding 1, and index 1 corresponds to subtracting 1; index 2 corresponds to adding 2, and index 3 corresponds to subtracting 2, continuing consecutively up to index 17, which would involve subtracting 9.
