# Zone Conquest: Rule Book

## Objective

In **Zone Conquest**, two players compete to control a majority of zones on a 3x3 grid. The primary goal is to be the first player to control **five or more zones**. Players achieve victory by strategically occupying and capturing zones, outmaneuvering their opponent to gain dominance over the grid.

## Setup

1. **Game Grid**: Prepare a 3x3 grid representing the nine zones of the battlefield. Each cell in the grid corresponds to one zone.

2. **Player Tokens**:
   - **Player 1** uses the symbol `X` to mark controlled zones.
   - **Player 2** uses the symbol `O` to mark controlled zones.

3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - The grid begins empty with no zones occupied.
   - Decide which player goes first (e.g., flip a coin or have each player roll a die, with the higher roll starting).

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 3x3 matrix displayed in the command-line interface, with cells numbered for reference:
  ```
  [1][2][3]
  [4][5][6]
  [7][8][9]
  ```
- **Tokens**:
  - `X` represents zones controlled by Player 1.
  - `O` represents zones controlled by Player 2.
- **Empty Cells**: Represented by their cell number or a blank space.

## Turns

- Players take turns performing actions.
- On a player's turn, they may choose to:
  1. **Occupy** an empty zone.
  2. **Attack** an opponent's zone, if eligible.

- **Turn Order**:
  1. **Action Declaration**: The player announces their chosen action and specifies the target zone.
  2. **Action Resolution**: The action is executed according to the game rules.
  3. **Turn Completion**: The turn ends, and play passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Occupying Zones

- **Occupy Action**:
  - A player can occupy any **empty zone** by placing their token (`X` or `O`) in that zone.
  - Occupying a zone requires no prerequisites.

### Attacking Zones

- **Attack Action**:
  - A player can attempt to capture an opponent's zone under the following conditions:
    - The target zone is **adjacent** (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to at least one zone already controlled by the attacking player.
    - The attacking player did **not attack the same zone in their immediate previous turn**.
  - **Successful Attack**:
    - The opponent's token is replaced with the attacker's token, and control of the zone shifts to the attacker.

- **Adjacency Example**:
  - If Player 1 (`X`) controls zone 5, they can attack zones 2, 4, 6, or 8, provided those zones are controlled by Player 2 (`O`).

### Restrictions

- **No Repeated Attacks**:
  - Players cannot attack the **same zone** on two consecutive turns. They must either attack a different zone or choose to occupy an empty zone.

- **Zone Control Limits**:
  - Once a player controls a zone, it remains under their control unless captured by the opponent through an attack.

### Winning the Game

- The game ends immediately when a player controls **five or more zones**.
- The player who achieves this condition is declared the **winner**.

## Scoring

- **Zone Control Count**:
  - Players keep track of the number of zones they control.
  - Control is visually represented on the grid using `X` and `O`.

- **Victory Condition**:
  - No point system is used beyond controlling zones.
  - The primary objective is to reach the majority control of the grid (five zones).

## Strategic Tips

- **Expand Early**: Quickly occupy central zones to maximize your options for future attacks.

- **Defensive Play**: Monitor the opponent's controlled zones and anticipate possible attacks.

- **Zone Adjacency**: Control zones in a cluster to enable multiple attack options.

- **Prevent Re-Attacks**: Remember that your opponent cannot attack the same zone consecutively; use this to plan your defenses.

- **Majority Focus**: Aim to control five zones as efficiently as possible rather than solely capturing opponent zones.
