In the gym environment, the action space consists of 26 discrete actions, indexed from 0 to 25. 

- **Action 0**: Represents the operation "Subtract 1" from the current number.
- **Actions 1 to 25**: Correspond to dividing the current number by one of the first 25 prime numbers. Specifically, each action index \( n \) (where \( n \) is from 1 to 25) corresponds to dividing by the \( n \)-th prime in the list of primes defined in the environment (e.g., action 1 corresponds to dividing by 2, action 2 corresponds to dividing by 3, and so forth up to action 25 which corresponds to dividing by 97).
