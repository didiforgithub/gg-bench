In the action space of the game, indices 0 to 18 correspond to selecting numbers 2 to 20 from the number pool. Specifically, an action with index `i` maps to choosing the number `i + 2`. Each index represents the choice of a specific number, and once a number is used in the game, its corresponding action index is marked as unavailable by setting its status in the number pool to 0.0.
