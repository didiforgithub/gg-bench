# Reach 27: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

**Reach 27** is a strategic two-player game where the primary goal is to be the player who brings the cumulative total to **exactly 27**. Players take turns adding numbers to a running total, and the game demands foresight and planning to outmaneuver the opponent. A player wins by making the total exactly 27 on their turn. If a player causes the total to exceed 27, they lose immediately.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection

- **Valid Choices**: On their turn, a player must select an integer between **1** and **9** inclusive.
- **Cumulative Total Limit**: Players may not choose a number that causes the cumulative total to exceed **27**.
- **Invalid Move**: Attempting to select an invalid number results in an immediate loss.

### Winning the Game

- **Exact Total of 27**: A player wins if they bring the cumulative total to **exactly 27** on their turn.
- **Forcing a Win**: Strategic selection of numbers can force the opponent into a losing position.

### Losing the Game

- **Exceeding 27**: A player loses immediately if their chosen number causes the cumulative total to exceed **27**.
- **Invalid Input**: Selecting a number outside the allowed range (less than 1 or greater than 9) results in a loss.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Players should anticipate future moves to avoid exceeding the total and to force the opponent into a difficult position.
- **Control the Total**: Keeping track of the cumulative total and calculating the potential outcomes is key to winning.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

**Starting the Game**:

- Player 1 and Player 2 agree that Player 1 will begin.
- The cumulative total is **0**.

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1** selects **5**.
- Cumulative total: 0 + 5 = **5**.
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  ```
  Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 9: 5
  Cumulative total is now 5.
  ```

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2** selects **7**.
- Cumulative total: 5 + 7 = **12**.
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  ```
  Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 9: 7
  Cumulative total is now 12.
  ```

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1** selects **9**.
- Cumulative total: 12 + 9 = **21**.
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  ```
  Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 9: 9
  Cumulative total is now 21.
  ```

**Turn 4**:

- **Player 2** must be cautious. The maximum number they can choose without exceeding 27 is **6** (since 21 + 6 = 27).
- **Player 2** selects **6**, reaching exactly 27.
- **Player 2 wins the game**.
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  ```
  Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 6: 6
  Cumulative total is now 27.
  Player 2 has reached 27 and wins the game!
  ```

### Alternate Ending

If **Player 2** had not calculated correctly and selected **7**:

- Cumulative total: 21 + 7 = **28**.
- **Player 2** exceeds 27 and loses the game.
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  ```
  Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 6: 7
  Cumulative total is now 28.
  Cumulative total exceeds 27.
  Player 2 loses the game!
  ```

**Strategy Note**: In this game, careful calculation and control of the cumulative total are essential. Players should aim to set up the total so that they can reach exactly 27 on their turn or force their opponent into a position where any move would cause them to exceed 27.
