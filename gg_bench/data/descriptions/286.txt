# Battle Wizards Duel

## Objective

Become the ultimate Battle Wizard by reducing your opponent's Health Points (HP) to zero using strategic spellcasting. Utilize a variety of spells to attack, defend, and heal, outmaneuvering your opponent to achieve victory.

## Setup

1. **Initialize Health Points**: Both players begin with **10 Health Points (HP)**.
2. **Prepare Spellbooks**: Each player has access to the same set of spells, numbered **1 to 5**, representing different magical abilities.
3. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first. This can be done by mutual agreement or a random method like flipping a coin.

## Game Components

- **Health Points (HP)**: A numerical representation of a player's vitality. When a player's HP reaches zero, they lose the game.
- **Spellbook**: A collection of spells available to each player. Spells are numbered **1** through **5**, each with unique effects:
  - **Spell 1**: *Firebolt* - Deals **1 damage** to the opponent.
  - **Spell 2**: *Lightning Strike* - Deals **2 damage** to the opponent.
  - **Spell 3**: *Dark Pact* - Deals **3 damage** to the opponent but costs **1 HP** from the caster.
  - **Spell 4**: *Shield* - Blocks damage from the opponent's next spell.
  - **Spell 5**: *Healing Touch* - Restores **2 HP** to the caster (cannot exceed 10 HP).

## Turns

1. **Spell Selection**: On your turn, choose one spell (number between **1** and **5**) to cast.
2. **Spell Declaration**: Announce your chosen spell to the opponent.
3. **Resolve Spell Effects**:
   - Apply the effects of the spell immediately, considering any active shields or special conditions.
4. **Turn Progression**: After resolving the spell, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Spellcasting

- **Casting Spells**: Players can cast any spell from their spellbook on their turn.
- **Spell Effects**:
  - *Spell 1 - Firebolt*: Deals **1 damage** to the opponent's HP.
  - *Spell 2 - Lightning Strike*: Deals **2 damage** to the opponent's HP.
  - *Spell 3 - Dark Pact*:
    - Deals **3 damage** to the opponent's HP.
    - Caster loses **1 HP** as a cost.
  - *Spell 4 - Shield*:
    - Blocks the damage from the opponent's next spell.
    - The shield remains active until it blocks a spell or is bypassed.
  - *Spell 5 - Healing Touch*:
    - Restores **2 HP** to the caster.
    - Caster's HP cannot exceed **10 HP**.

### Damage and Healing

- **Applying Damage**:
  - Subtract the damage dealt from the opponent's current HP.
  - If a shield is active, damage from one spell is negated, and the shield is then deactivated.
- **Healing**:
  - When casting *Healing Touch*, add **2 HP** to your current HP.
  - HP cannot exceed the maximum of **10 HP**.

### Shield Mechanics

- **Activation**: Casting *Shield* activates a protective barrier.
- **Blocking Damage**:
  - The shield blocks **all damage** from the opponent's next spell.
  - The shield does **not** block any secondary effects (e.g., the self-damage from *Dark Pact*).
- **Limitations**:
  - The shield blocks only one spell and then expires.
  - If both players have shields active, each shield only protects its caster.
  - Shields do **not** stack; casting *Shield* while one is already active has no additional effect.

### Victory Conditions

- **Winning the Game**: Reduce your opponent's HP to **zero**.
- **Losing the Game**: If your HP drops to **zero** or below, you lose.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw.

## Scoring

- **Match Play**: Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of victories to determine an overall winner.
- **Tracking HP**: Keep a record of both players' HP throughout the game for transparency and strategic planning.
