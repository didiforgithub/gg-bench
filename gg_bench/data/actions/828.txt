In the game environment, the action space is a discrete set where each index corresponds to a prime number that can be subtracted from the current total. The mapping is as follows: each index `i` in the action space corresponds to the `i-th` prime number in the `primes_list`. For example, index `0` corresponds to the prime number `2`, index `1` corresponds to `3`, and so on, up to index `7` which corresponds to `19`. This mapping allows the player to select which prime number to subtract based on its index in the action space.
