The action space in the environment is represented as a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to 8. Each index corresponds to a number from 1 to 9, respectively, within the game. Specifically, an action with index `i` (where `i` is between 0 and 8) maps to placing the number `i + 1` onto the stack. Thus, the action index 0 places the number 1, action index 1 places the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which places the number 9.
