## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Attacking**:
   - The attacking player selects one of their own numbers to challenge one of the opponent's numbers.
   - The opponent does not know which number the attacker has chosen until the Reveal Phase.
2. **Defending**:
   - The defending player does not select a number; they simply reveal the targeted number during the Reveal Phase.
3. **Outcome**:
   - **Higher Number Wins**: The number with the higher value wins the encounter.
     - The player controlling the lower number removes it from the game.
   - **Tie**:
     - If both numbers are equal, **both numbers are eliminated** from the game.
4. **Elimination**:
   - Eliminated numbers are removed from the player's remaining numbers and cannot be used again.
5. **Number Usage**:
   - Each number can only be used **once** per game.
   - Once a number has been used in an attack or has been eliminated, it cannot be reused.
6. **Hidden Information**:
   - Players keep track of their own remaining numbers privately.
   - Players do not know which numbers the opponent has remaining, except through deduction based on previous moves.
