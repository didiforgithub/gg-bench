# Sequence Duel

---

## Objective

**Be the first player to reach or exceed the target score** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared sequence, while limiting your opponent's options.

---

## Setup

- **Number Sequence:** Initialize a shared sequence of numbers from 1 to **N** (e.g., **N = 20**).
- **Players:** Two players, designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Scores:** Both players start with a score of **0**.
- **Target Score:** Decide on a target score to win the game (e.g., **30** points).
- **First Turn:** Determine who goes first (Player 1 takes the first turn by default).

---

## Game Components

- **Number Sequence:** A list of integers from **1 to N** displayed in order.
  - Example: `[1, 2, 3, ..., 20]`
- **Players:** Two participants controlling the game actions.
- **Score Tracker:** A means to keep track of each player's accumulated points.
- **Turn Indicator:** Displays whose turn it is during the game.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns; Player 1 starts first.
- **Turn Actions:**
  - **Select a Number:** Choose an available number from the sequence based on the rules.
  - **Update Score:** Add the chosen number's value to your score.
  - **Update Sequence:** Remove the chosen number from the sequence.
- **Turn Progression:** The turn passes to the other player after the actions are completed.
- **Skipping a Turn:** If a player has no valid moves, they skip their turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. First Turn

- **Player 1:** May select **any number** from the initial sequence.

### 2. Subsequent Turns

- **Valid Choices:** On your turn, you must select a number that is either:
  - **A multiple** of the **last number** chosen by your opponent, **or**
  - **A factor** of the **last number** chosen by your opponent.
- **Available Numbers:** The chosen number must still be in the sequence (not previously selected).

### 3. Definitions

- **Factors:** Numbers that divide evenly into another number without leaving a remainder.
- **Multiples:** Numbers that are the product of an integer and another integer.

### 4. No Valid Move

- **Skipping Turn:** If no numbers in the sequence satisfy the valid choices criteria, you skip your turn.
- **Game Continuation:** The game continues until a player reaches the target score.

### 5. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:** The first player to **reach or exceed the target score** wins immediately.
- **No Draws:** There are no draw conditions; the game continues until a player wins.

---

## Scoring

- **Accumulating Points:** Each selected number's value is added to the player's total score.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep a cumulative tally after each turn.
- **Strategy:** Balancing high-value picks with strategic plays can accelerate reaching the target score.
