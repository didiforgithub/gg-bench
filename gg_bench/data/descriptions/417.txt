# Rule Book for "Numerical Nexus"

## Objective

**Be the first player to reach exactly 50 points.**

Players take turns performing mathematical operations to increase their individual scores. The primary goal is to reach a score of exactly 50 points before your opponent does. Strategic selection and management of operations are key to victory.

## Setup

- **Players:** 2
- **Starting Scores:** Both players begin with a score of **0**.
- **Operations Pool:** Each player has access to a set of mathematical operations with limited uses.
- **Interface:** The game is played in a command-line interface where players input their commands.

## Game Components

### Operations

Each player can perform the following operations on their score:

1. **Addition (+):**
   - **+1** (usable **3** times)
   - **+3** (usable **2** times)
   - **+5** (usable **1** time)

2. **Multiplication (×):**
   - **×2** (usable **2** times)
   - **×3** (usable **1** time)

3. **Special Operation:**
   - **Reset to 0** (usable **once** per game)

**Notes:**

- Each operation has a limited number of uses per player.
- Players must track their remaining uses for each operation.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
2. **Turn Actions:** On their turn, a player must:
   - Select an available operation.
   - Apply the operation to their score.
   - Announce their new score and remaining uses of that operation.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Performing Operations

- **Valid Operations:** A player may only use an operation if they have remaining uses for it.
- **Score Limit:** A player's score must not exceed **50**. If an operation would cause the score to surpass 50, that operation is invalid and cannot be used.
- **Exact Victory:** A player wins by reaching a score of **exactly 50**.
- **Special Operation - Reset to 0:**
  - Can be used on **either player's score**.
  - Resets the chosen player's score back to **0**.
  - Counts as the player's turn action.
  - Usable **once per game** by each player.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:** The first player to reach exactly **50** points wins.
- **Forced Loss:** If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (no operations can be performed without exceeding 50 or no operations remain), they lose the game.

### Game End Scenarios

- **Win:** A player reaches exactly 50 points.
- **Loss:** A player cannot perform any valid operation on their turn.
- **Forfeit:** A player chooses to concede the game.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Scores:** Players must keep an accurate record of their current score after each turn.
- **Operation Usage:** Players must also track the number of uses remaining for each operation.
