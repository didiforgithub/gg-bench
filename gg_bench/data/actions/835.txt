The action space indices (0-7) correspond to the following moves in the game:

- **Index 0 to 3**: Addition operations where:
  - **0** = Add 2
  - **1** = Add 3
  - **2** = Add 4
  - **3** = Add 5

- **Index 4 to 7**: Multiplication operations where:
  - **4** = Multiply by 2
  - **5** = Multiply by 3
  - **6** = Multiply by 4
  - **7** = Multiply by 5

Each index represents a specific combination of operation (add or multiply) and number (2 to 5).
