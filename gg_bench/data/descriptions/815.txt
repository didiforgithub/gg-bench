# Number Quest

*An engaging two-player, turn-based strategy game played on the command line, where players race to reach the target number by strategically adding or multiplying numbers.*

---

## Objective

The primary goal of **Number Quest** is to be the first player to reach the **target number** exactly by strategically performing allowed mathematical operations on a shared **current number**. The player who manipulates the current number to match the target number wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Determine the Target Number**: Decide on a target number to reach. This can be any positive integer (e.g., 20, 50, 100). For a quick game, a lower number like 20 is recommended.
2. **Initialize the Current Number**: Start the game with the current number set to **1**.
3. **Decide Turn Order**: Players decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin or mutual agreement).

---

## Game Components

- **Target Number**: The agreed-upon number that players aim to reach (e.g., 20).
- **Current Number**: The number that players manipulate during their turns, starting at 1.
- **Operations**: Allowed mathematical operationsâ€”addition and multiplication.
- **Command-Line Interface**: All interactions occur through the command line; no physical components are required.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - On each turn, a player must perform **one** operation on the current number.

- **Player Actions During a Turn**:
  1. **Select an Operation**:
     - **Addition**: Add an integer from **1 to 5** (inclusive) to the current number.
     - **Multiplication**: Multiply the current number by **2** or **3**.
  2. **Apply the Operation**:
     - Update the current number with the result of the operation.
     - Announce the new current number.
  3. **End of Turn**:
     - Check for a win condition.
     - If the target number is reached, the game ends.
     - If not, the turn passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Allowed Operations**:

   - **Addition**:
     - You may add an integer between **1 and 5** to the current number.
     - Example: If the current number is 7, you can choose to add 3 to make it 10.
   - **Multiplication**:
     - You may multiply the current number by **2** or **3**.
     - Example: If the current number is 4, you can multiply by 2 to make it 8.

2. **Operation Restrictions**:

   - **No Exceeding the Target**:
     - The result of your operation **must not exceed** the target number.
     - If all possible operations would exceed the target, you **lose your turn**.
   - **Valid Moves Only**:
     - You must choose an operation that results in a number **less than or equal to** the target number.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - **Exact Match**:
     - The first player to make the current number **exactly equal** to the target number **wins the game**.
   - **Forced Loss**:
     - If a player **cannot perform any valid operation** on their turn (all operations would exceed the target number), they lose **their turn**, and play passes back to the other player.
     - If **both players cannot make a move**, the **last player who increased** the current number **loses the game**.

4. **No Draws**:

   - The game cannot end in a draw. There will always be a winner based on the above rules.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**:
  - No points are tracked; victory is achieved by being the first to reach the target number according to the game rules.
- **No Ongoing Score**:
  - The game is a single-round match with a clear winner at the end.

## Examples

### Example Game Play with Target Number 20

#### Starting the Game:

- **Target Number**: 20
- **Current Number**: 1
- **Player 1** and **Player 2** decide that Player 1 will start.

#### Turn 1 - Player 1:

- **Current Number**: 1
- **Available Operations**:
  - Add 1-5
  - Multiply by 2 or 3
- **Player 1's Choice**: Add 5
- **Calculation**: 1 + 5 = 6
- **New Current Number**: 6
- **Announcement**: "Player 1 adds 5. Current Number is now 6."

#### Turn 2 - Player 2:

- **Current Number**: 6
- **Available Operations**:
  - Add 1-5
  - Multiply by 2 or 3
- **Player 2's Choice**: Multiply by 3
- **Calculation**: 6 * 3 = 18
- **New Current Number**: 18
- **Announcement**: "Player 2 multiplies by 3. Current Number is now 18."

#### Turn 3 - Player 1:

- **Current Number**: 18
- **Available Operations**:
  - Add 1 or 2 (adding more would exceed 20)
- **Player 1's Choice**: Add 2
- **Calculation**: 18 + 2 = 20
- **New Current Number**: 20
- **Announcement**: "Player 1 adds 2. Current Number is now 20."

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider how your move will affect the current number and the options available to your opponent.
- **Control the Flow**: Try to force the current number into ranges that limit your opponent's valid moves.
- **Calculate Outcomes**: Before making a move, think about the possible responses from your opponent and choose the operation that maximizes your chance of winning.
- **Avoid Overstepping**: Be cautious not to increase the current number too rapidly if it might give your opponent a direct path to win.
