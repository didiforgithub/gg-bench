In the **Divisor Duel** game environment, the action space is represented as a `Discrete` space with 10 possible actions, corresponding to the digits 0 through 9. Each action index directly maps to a digit move in the game. For example, choosing action index 3 corresponds to selecting and appending the digit `3` to the sequence. This simple 1:1 mapping ensures that each action performed by the player corresponds to adding a specific digit from 0 to 9 to the shared sequence.
