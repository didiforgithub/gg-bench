In the given gym environment for the **Divisor Duel** game, the action space is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to 60 inclusive, which corresponds to all potential actions a player could take. However, only a subset of these actions, specifically the proper divisors of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself), are valid moves in the game. During each turn, the player's selected action should be one of these valid proper divisors to make a legal move, reducing the current number accordingly. Any action outside this subset results in an invalid move and ends the game with a penalty.
