# Game Name: Pattern Builder

## Objective

Be the first player to collect a set of four numbers that can form an arithmetic progression. Players must strategically select numbers to build their sequences while preventing their opponent from completing theirs. An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

## Setup

1. **Available Numbers**: A shared pool of numbers ranging from 1 to 9.
2. **Player Sequences**: Each player has their own sequence (initially empty) to which they will add numbers during the game.
3. **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss, random selection).

## Game Components

- **Numbers Pool**: The integers from 1 to 9, each number can only be selected once per game.
- **Player Sequences**: Lists where players record their selected numbers.
- **Turn Indicator**: Keeps track of whose turn it is.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with the designated first player.
2. **Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: Choose any remaining number from the available pool.
   - **Update Sequence**: Add the selected number to your sequence.
3. **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their action, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, you must select one number from the available pool.
   - You cannot select a number that has already been chosen by either player.
2. **Building Sequences**:
   - Add the selected number to your sequence.
   - Your sequence can be rearranged at any time to form potential arithmetic progressions.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have four numbers in their sequence that can be arranged into an arithmetic progression wins.
   - An arithmetic progression must have a common difference between consecutive numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8 with a common difference of 2).
4. **Preventing Opponent's Progression**:
   - Players may strategically select numbers to block their opponent from forming an arithmetic progression.
5. **No Draws**:
   - There is always a winner; the game continues until one player forms a valid arithmetic progression of four numbers.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who first creates a valid arithmetic progression of four numbers wins the game.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking; the focus is on achieving the objective before the opponent.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Available Numbers at Start**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 1:
- **Player 1** selects **5**.
  - **Player 1's Sequence**: [5]
  - **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 2:
- **Player 2** selects **3**.
  - **Player 2's Sequence**: [3]
  - **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 3:
- **Player 1** selects **7**.
  - **Player 1's Sequence**: [5, 7]
  - **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9

#### Turn 4:
- **Player 2** selects **1**.
  - **Player 2's Sequence**: [3, 1]
  - **Available Numbers**: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9

#### Turn 5:
- **Player 1** selects **9**.
  - **Player 1's Sequence**: [5, 7, 9]
  - **Available Numbers**: 2, 4, 6, 8

#### Turn 6:
- **Player 2** selects **4**.
  - **Player 2's Sequence**: [3, 1, 4]
  - **Available Numbers**: 2, 6, 8

#### Turn 7:
- **Player 1** selects **3**.
  - **Invalid Move**: **3** has already been selected by **Player 2**.
  - **Corrected Action**: **Player 1** selects **2** instead.
  - **Player 1's Sequence**: [5, 7, 9, 2]
  - **Available Numbers**: 6, 8

#### Checking for Win:
- **Player 1's Sequence**: [2, 5, 7, 9]
  - Rearranged to [2, 5, 8, 11] is invalid because 8 and 11 are not in the pool.
  - Correct rearrangement: [2, 5, 7, 9]
    - Differences: 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 9-7=2 (Not consistent)
- **No win yet**.

#### Turn 8:
- **Player 2** selects **6**.
  - **Player 2's Sequence**: [3, 1, 4, 6]
  - **Available Numbers**: 8

#### Checking for Win:
- **Player 2's Sequence**: [1, 3, 4, 6]
  - Rearranged to [1, 3, 4, 6]
    - Differences: 3-1=2, 4-3=1, 6-4=2 (Not consistent)
- **No win yet**.

#### Turn 9:
- **Player 1** selects **8**.
  - **Player 1's Sequence**: [5, 7, 9, 2, 8]
  - **Available Numbers**: None

#### Checking for Win:
- **Player 1's Sequence**: [2, 5, 8, 11]
  - Since 11 is not available, try another combination.
- Try [2, 5, 8, 9]
  - Differences: 5-2=3, 8-5=3, 9-8=1 (Not consistent)
- Try [5, 7, 9, 2]
  - Rearranged to [2, 5, 7, 9]
    - Differences: 5-2=3, 7-5=2, 9-7=2 (Not consistent)
- **No win yet**.

#### Turn 10:
- **Player 2** cannot select any more numbers.

#### End of Game:
- Since all numbers have been selected and neither player has formed an arithmetic progression of four numbers, the game continues into a tie-breaker round or sudden death based on predefined agreements (e.g., using the sequences built to form the longest possible arithmetic progression).

## Command-Line Interaction Sample

### Start of Game
```
Available Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Player 1's Sequence: []
Player 2's Sequence: []
```

### Player Turns

**Player 1's Turn**
```
Player 1, select a number: 5
Available Numbers after selection: 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
Player 1's Sequence: [5]
```

**Player 2's Turn**
```
Player 2, select a number: 3
Available Numbers after selection: 1 2 4 6 7 8 9
Player 2's Sequence: [3]
```

*(Subsequent turns continue in this pattern)*

When a player forms an arithmetic progression:

**Player Announcement**
```
Player 1 has formed an arithmetic progression: [3, 5, 7, 9]
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of which numbers are available and which ones your opponent is collecting.
- **Blocking**: If you notice your opponent is close to completing an arithmetic progression, consider selecting numbers they need.
- **Multiple Options**: Try to collect numbers that give you multiple ways to form an arithmetic progression.
- **Flexibility**: Remember you can rearrange your sequence to find a valid progression.

## Conclusion

"Pattern Builder" is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's moves. Its straightforward rules make it easy to learn and play in a command-line interface, while the strategic depth ensures engaging and competitive gameplay.
