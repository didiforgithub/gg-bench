# Prime Pursuit

**A Two-Player Numerical Strategy Game**

---

## Objective

Be the first player to accumulate a total sum that is a **prime number between 20 and 31 inclusive** without exceeding 31. Strategic selection of numbers is essential to reach a prime total before your opponent. If a player exceeds a total sum of 31, they lose the game immediately.

---

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players
- **Starting Sums**: Both players start with a total sum of **0**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers **1** through **10** (inclusive). Each number can be chosen multiple times.
- **Determine First Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss, random selection, or mutual agreement).

---

## Game Components

1. **Number Pool**: The numbers **1** to **10**, available for both players to choose from during their turns.

2. **Player Sum Tracker**: A running total for each player that keeps track of the sum of the numbers they have selected.

3. **Prime Number List**: The prime numbers between **20** and **31** inclusive, which are the target sums to win the game. These primes are:
   - **23**
   - **29**
   - **31**

---

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Announce Current Totals**: Before each turn, the current total sums of both players are displayed.
  2. **Number Selection**: The active player selects a number from **1** to **10**.
  3. **Update Total Sum**: Add the chosen number to the player's total sum.
  4. **Check for Victory or Loss**:
     - If the player's total sum equals one of the target prime numbers, they win.
     - If the player's total sum exceeds **31**, they lose.
  5. **Switch Turns**: The other player takes their turn following the same structure.

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection

- On your turn, **choose any number between 1 and 10** (inclusive).
- You may choose the **same number multiple times** during the game.
- Both players may choose the **same numbers** independently.

### 2. Sum Calculation

- **Cumulative Sum**: Your chosen numbers are added together to form your total sum.
- **Tracking**: Keep track of your total sum after each turn. This sum determines your progress toward winning or losing.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Prime Total Sum**: The first player to reach a total sum that is **exactly** one of the target prime numbers (**23**, **29**, **31**) wins the game immediately.

### 4. Exceeding the Limit

- **Automatic Loss**: If your total sum **exceeds 31**, you lose the game immediately.
- **Careful Planning**: Avoid selecting numbers that would push your total sum over 31.

### 5. Visibility

- **Open Information**: Both players' total sums are visible to each other at all times.
- **Strategic Awareness**: Use the knowledge of your opponent's total sum to inform your strategy.

### 6. No Draws

- The game cannot end in a draw. A winner is always determined by either:
  - A player reaching a prime total sum within the target range.
  - A player exceeding the total sum of 31, resulting in their loss.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Achieve a total sum of **23**, **29**, or **31**.
- **Losing**: Exceed a total sum of **31**.
- **No Points System**: The game is won by meeting the winning conditions, not by accruing points.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Players can play multiple rounds, keeping track of victories to determine an overall winner if desired.

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Totals: Player 1 = 7, Player 2 = 0
   - Player 2 selects **8**
   - Player 2's total sum: 0 + 8 = **8**

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current Totals: Player 1 = 7, Player 2 = 8
   - Player 1 selects **9**
   - Player 1's total sum: 7 + 9 = **16**

4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Totals: Player 1 = 16, Player 2 = 8
   - Player 2 selects **7**
   - Player 2's total sum: 8 + 7 = **15**

5. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current Totals: Player 1 = 16, Player 2 = 15
   - Player 1 selects **7**
   - Player 1's total sum: 16 + 7 = **23**

**Outcome**:

- Player 1's total sum is **23**, a target prime number.
