The action space indices map to the moves in the game as follows: 

- Index 0 corresponds to the move of adding the number 1 to the sequence.
- Index 1 corresponds to the move of adding the number 2 to the sequence.
- Index 2 corresponds to the move of adding the number 3 to the sequence.

These mappings are achieved by adding 1 to the action index, thus transforming indices (0, 1, 2) to numbers (1, 2, 3).
