In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is a discrete space with 10 actions, corresponding to the 10 prime numbers in the shared pool: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Each action index from 0 to 9 maps directly to one of these prime numbers in the order they appear in the list. For example, action index 0 maps to the prime number 2, index 1 maps to 3, and so on, up to index 9 which maps to 29. When a player selects an action index, they are choosing the corresponding prime number from the pool. Once selected, the prime number is removed from the pool by setting the corresponding prime availability to 0 in the observation space.
