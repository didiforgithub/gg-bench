In the game environment, the action space indices map to the following moves: indices 0 to 9 correspond to selecting blocks with heights 1 to 10, respectively (e.g., action 0 selects a block of height 1, action 1 selects a block of height 2, and so on up to action 9, which selects a block of height 10). The additional action index 10 is used to indicate a "pass" move, which is selected when no valid block can be added to avoid exceeding the tower height limit.
