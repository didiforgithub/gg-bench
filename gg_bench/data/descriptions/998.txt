# Color Clash - Rule Book

## Objective

**Color Clash** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a linear track. Each player controls a set of colored disks and aims to be the first to advance all their disks ahead of their opponent's disks. Victory is achieved when all of a player's disks occupy higher-numbered positions on the track than all of the opponent's disks. There are no draws in Color Clash; the game continues until one player wins.

## Setup

1. **Game Track**:
   - The game is played on a linear track with positions numbered from **1** to **9**.
   - The track is represented as a series of positions that can each hold one disk.

2. **Players and Colors**:
   - Two players: one controls **Red disks**, and the other controls **Blue disks**.

3. **Initial Disk Placement**:
   - Each player has **four disks**, labeled for identification:
     - Red disks: **R1**, **R2**, **R3**, **R4**
     - Blue disks: **B1**, **B2**, **B3**, **B4**
   - Disks are placed alternately on the track starting from position 1:
     - **Position 1**: Red disk **R1**
     - **Position 2**: Blue disk **B1**
     - **Position 3**: Red disk **R2**
     - **Position 4**: Blue disk **B2**
     - **Position 5**: Red disk **R3**
     - **Position 6**: Blue disk **B3**

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a player completes their move, control passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Movement Rules

- **Forward Movement Only**:
  - Disks move from lower-numbered to higher-numbered positions.
  - Disks cannot move backward.

- **Movement Distance**:
  - A disk may move forward to any unoccupied position ahead of it, bypassing any number of disks (both own and opponent's).
  - **Example**: Disk **R1** on position 1 can move to any empty position beyond its current position.

- **Jumping Over Disks**:
  - Disks can jump over any occupied positions but cannot land on them.
  - There is no limit to the number of disks a moving disk can jump over.

- **Restrictions**:
  - A disk cannot move beyond position **9**.
  - If the last position (position 9) is occupied, disks cannot move past it.

### 2. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - A player wins when **all** their disks are positioned **ahead** of **all** opponent's disks.
  - This means the lowest-numbered position occupied by a player's disks is higher than the highest-numbered position occupied by the opponent's disks.

- **No Draws**:
  - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player meets the victory condition.

### 3. Blocking and Strategy

- **Blocking**:
  - Players can strategically block their opponent's disks by occupying positions that limit the opponent's movement options.

- **Forced Moves**:
  - If a player has no valid moves (all disks are blocked by the opponent), they lose the game.

## Scoring

- **No Points System**:
  - Color Clash does not use a points system.
  
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The focus is on meeting the victory condition outlined above.
  - The first player to successfully advance all their disks ahead of the opponent's disks wins.

## Strategy Tips

1. **Advance Strategically**:
   - Move your disks to higher positions to get ahead of your opponent.
   - Focus on moving disks that are blocked or have limited movement options.

2. **Block Opponent Disks**:
   - Position your disks to limit where your opponent can move.
   - Occupying key positions can force your opponent into disadvantageous moves.

3. **Disk Selection**:
   - Sometimes, it's better to move a disk that's behind to bring it ahead.
   - Assess which disk movement will bring you closer to victory.

4. **Anticipate Moves**:
   - Think ahead about how your opponent might respond.
   - Plan your moves to counter your opponent's potential strategies.
