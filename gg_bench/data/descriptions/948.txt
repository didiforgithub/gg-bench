# Path to Victory

## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Be the first player to navigate a shared token from the center of a 5x5 grid to your opponent's starting corner.

- **Victory Condition**: Move the shared token to your opponent's starting position before they reach yours.
- **Win**: Successfully direct the token to your opponent's corner following the game's movement rules.
- **Loss**: Your opponent moves the token to your starting corner before you do.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: Generate a 5x5 grid, with coordinates ranging from `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`.
2. **Starting Positions**:
   - **Player 1 (P1)** starts at the top-left corner `(0,0)`.
   - **Player 2 (P2)** starts at the bottom-right corner `(4,4)`.
3. **Token Placement**: Place a shared token at the center of the grid at position `(2,2)`.

The initial grid setup:

```
[P1] .  .  .  .
 .   .  .  .  .
 .   . [T] .  .
 .   .  .  .  .
 .   .  .  . [P2]
```

- `[P1]`: Player 1's starting corner.
- `[P2]`: Player 2's starting corner.
- `[T]`: Token's starting position.
- `.`: Empty grid spaces.

## Game Components

1. **Grid**: A 5x5 two-dimensional grid representing the game board.
   - Each cell identified by `(row, column)` coordinates.
2. **Shared Token**: A single token that both players move.
   - **Appearance**: Represented by `[T]` in the grid display.
3. **Players**:
   - **Player 1**:
     - **Symbol**: `[P1]`
     - **Starting Position**: `(0,0)`
   - **Player 2**:
     - **Symbol**: `[P2]`
     - **Starting Position**: `(4,4)`

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - On your turn, move the shared token one space in any cardinal direction (North, South, East, West).
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - **Token Movement**:
     - The token can move one space per turn.
     - Allowed directions: Up (`U`), Down (`D`), Left (`L`), Right (`R`).
     - The token cannot move diagonally.
   - **Grid Boundaries**:
     - The token cannot move outside the grid. Moves that would exit the grid are invalid.
   - **Prohibited Moves**:
     - You cannot move the token back to the cell just occupied in your opponent's previous turn (no immediate backtracking).
2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to move the token onto their opponent's starting position (`[P1]` for Player 2, `[P2]` for Player 1) wins.
3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts an invalid move, they must choose a different move.
   - Continual invalid move attempts may result in forfeiting the game (at the discretion of game rules enforcement).

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Winning the game by reaching the opponent's starting corner.
- **No Point System**: The game is won by achieving the objective; no points are tracked.
- **Game End**: The game ends immediately when a player wins.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

**Initial Positions**:

- Token at `(2,2)`.
- Player 1 aims to move the token to `(4,4)`.
- Player 2 aims to move the token to `(0,0)`.

### Sample Turn Sequence

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Moves token Down (`D`).
- **Token Position**: `(3,2)`.
- **Command**: `D`

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Moves token Right (`R`).
- **Token Position**: `(3,3)`.
- **Command**: `R`

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Moves token Down (`D`).
- **Token Position**: `(4,3)`.
- **Command**: `D`

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action**: Invalid Move Attempted. Tries to move token to `(3,3)` (the cell Player 1 just moved from), which is prohibited.
- **Alternate Action**: Moves token Right (`R`).
- **Token Position**: `(4,4)`.
- **Command**: `R`
- **Result**: Player 2 wins by moving the token to Player 1's starting position.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start**

```
Welcome to Path to Victory!
Player 1 starts at (0,0).
Player 2 starts at (4,4).
The token is at (2,2).

Player 1's turn.
Enter move (U/D/L/R): D
Token moved Down to (3,2).

Player 2's turn.
Enter move (U/D/L/R): R
Token moved Right to (3,3).

Player 1's turn.
Enter move (U/D/L/R): D
Token moved Down to (4,3).

Player 2's turn.
Enter move (U/D/L/R): R
Token moved Right to (4,4).
Player 2 has reached Player 1's starting position and wins the game!
```

**Explanation**:

- **Turn 1**:
  - Player 1 moves Down. Token moves to `(3,2)`.
- **Turn 2**:
  - Player 2 moves Right. Token moves to `(3,3)`.
- **Turn 3**:
  - Player 1 moves Down. Token moves to `(4,3)`.
- **Turn 4**:
  - Player 2 attempts an invalid move back to `(3,3)`, which is prohibited.
  - Player 2 chooses to move Right instead.
  - Token moves to `(4,4)` (Player 1's starting position).
  - Player 2 wins.

## Strategy Tips

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Try to predict the opponent's strategy to block their optimal path.
- **Control the Center**: Maintain positions that allow multiple movement options.
- **Avoid Backtracking**: Remember you cannot reverse the opponent's last move; plan accordingly.
- **Edge Advantage**: Utilize the edges of the grid to limit your opponent's movement options.

## Implementation Notes

- **Simple Coding**: The game mechanics involve basic movement and boundary checks, suitable for command-line programming.
- **No Draws**: The game continues until a player wins; there is no possibility of a tie.
- **Quick Gameplay**: With each move bringing the token closer to a corner, games are typically short.
- **Skill-Based Outcome**: Strategic planning and foresight give skilled players a consistent edge.
