The action space in the game is a Discrete space of size 9, representing numbers 1 to 9 available for selection. Each index from 0 to 8 in the action space corresponds directly to the numbers 1 to 9, respectively. When a player selects an action `a` (where `a` is the index in the action space), they effectively choose the number `a + 1` from the number pool.
