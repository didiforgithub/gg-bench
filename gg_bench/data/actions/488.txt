In the game, the `action_space` is defined as `Discrete(6)`, which means there are six possible actions indexed from 0 to 5. Each index corresponds to a specific movement:

- **Action 0:** Move forward by 1 position.
- **Action 1:** Move backward by 1 position.
- **Action 2:** Move forward by 2 positions.
- **Action 3:** Move backward by 2 positions.
- **Action 4:** Move forward by 3 positions.
- **Action 5:** Move backward by 3 positions.

This mapping allows precise control over the player's movement by indexing actions and linking them to the exact movement direction and distance specified in the game rules.
