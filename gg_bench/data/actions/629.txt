In the provided game environment, the action space consists of 19 discrete actions, indexed from 0 to 18. Each index corresponds to a unique number in the pool of integers ranging from 2 to 20. Specifically, action index 0 maps to the number 2, index 1 maps to the number 3, and so on, up to index 18, which maps to the number 20. This means when a player takes an action by selecting an index `i`, they are effectively choosing the number `i + 2` from the number pool for their move. As each move occurs, the chosen number is removed from the pool, ensuring it cannot be selected again.
