The action space indices range from 0 to 9, each representing one of the block values that can be placed by the player. The index `0` corresponds to placing a block with the value `1`, the index `1` corresponds to a block with the value `2`, and so on, up to the index `9`, which corresponds to a block with the value `10`. This mapping allows each action index to directly correlate with a specific block value that the player chooses to place on the tower during their turn.
