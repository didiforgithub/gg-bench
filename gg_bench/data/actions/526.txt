In the custom gym environment for the game, the action space indices map to specific moves for each player's pieces. The mapping is as follows:

- There are 6 main actions, corresponding to moving each of the player's three pieces forward by either one or two positions.
- Actions 0-1 correspond to Player 1's piece `P1-A` moving forward by 1 or 2 positions.
- Actions 2-3 correspond to Player 1's piece `P1-B` moving forward by 1 or 2 positions.
- Actions 4-5 correspond to Player 1's piece `P1-C` moving forward by 1 or 2 positions.
- Actions 6-7 correspond to Player 2's piece `P2-A` moving forward by 1 or 2 positions.
- Actions 8-9 correspond to Player 2's piece `P2-B` moving forward by 1 or 2 positions.
- Actions 10-11 correspond to Player 2's piece `P2-C` moving forward by 1 or 2 positions.
- Action 6 is a pass action usable when no valid moves are available.
