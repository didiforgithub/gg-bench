In the gym environment, each action space index from 0 to 7 corresponds to a swap of two adjacent numbers in the sequence. Specifically, each index indicates the pair of positions to swap:

- Action 0: Swap positions 0 and 1
- Action 1: Swap positions 1 and 2
- Action 2: Swap positions 2 and 3
- Action 3: Swap positions 3 and 4
- Action 4: Swap positions 4 and 5
- Action 5: Swap positions 5 and 6
- Action 6: Swap positions 6 and 7
- Action 7: Swap positions 7 and 8

These actions directly map to possible swaps between consecutive numbers in the sequence.
