In the provided gym environment for Factor Frenzy, the action space indices (ranging from 0 to 18) directly map to the numbers in the game's initial number pool, which are the integers 2 through 20. Each index corresponds to a specific number in this ordered list, such that action index 0 maps to the number 2, action index 1 maps to 3, and so forth, up to action index 18 which maps to the number 20. During the game, selecting an action index means choosing the respective number from the pool, given that it is still available and constitutes a valid move according to the game rules.
