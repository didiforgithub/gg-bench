The action space indices in the gym environment code represent the numbers 1 to 20 as indices 0 to 19. Each index in the action space corresponds directly to a number in the game by adding 1 to the index value. Therefore, action index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on up to index 19, which maps to the number 20. This mapping allows players to select numbers from the range 1 to 20 using the action space of discrete indices.
