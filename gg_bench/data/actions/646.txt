In the game, the action space consists of two discrete actions, represented by indices 0 and 1. Each index corresponds to a specific move a player can make:

- **Action 0**: Selects a digit from the start (leftmost end) of the shared sequence.
- **Action 1**: Selects a digit from the end (rightmost end) of the shared sequence.
