- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1 (White)**: Knight starts at position **(1, 1)** (bottom-left corner of the board).

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Knight's Move**:
  - The knight moves in an **'L'-shape**:
    - Two squares in one direction (vertical or horizontal), then one square perpendicular.
    - Or one square in one direction, then two squares perpendicular.
  - Example Moves from position **(4, 4)**:
    - To **(6, 5)**, **(6, 3)**, **(2, 5)**, **(2, 3)**, **(5, 6)**, **(3, 6)**, **(5, 2)**, **(3, 2)**.

- **Legal Moves**:
  - A move is legal if:
    - The destination square is within the bounds of the board (coordinates between **1** and **8**).
    - The destination square is **active** (not removed).
    - The destination square is **not occupied** by the opponent's knight.

- **Square Removal**:
  - After moving, the destination square becomes **removed**.
  - Removed squares cannot be landed on for the remainder of the game.

- **Occupied Squares**:
  - Knights **cannot** move to a square occupied by the opponent's knight.
  - Knights **can** move over removed or occupied squares but cannot land on them.

### Additional Rules

- **Mandatory Movement**:
  - Players **must** move their knight on their turn if a legal move exists.
  - If a player has no legal moves, they **lose** the game.

- **No Passing**:
  - Players **cannot** pass their turn; they must move if possible.

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The game ends when a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.
  - The opposing player is declared the **winner**.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who forces their opponent into a position with no legal moves **wins**.
  
- **No Points System**:
  - There is no point tracking; the game is won by immobilizing the opponent's knight.

Assuming a simple command-line interface, here's how players might interact with the game:

### Displaying the Board

- The board is displayed with coordinates for each square.
- Active squares are marked with `.`.
- Removed squares are marked with `X`.
- Player 1's knight is marked with `N1`.
- Player 2's knight is marked with `N2`.

### Sample Turn

**Player 1's Turn**:

- **Display Legal Moves**: "(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 6), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5)"
- **Player Input**: `Move to (5,6)`

**System Response**:

- "Player 1 moves to (5, 6)."
- "Square (5, 6) is now removed."
- Updates the board display.

**Player 2's Turn**:

- **Prompt**: "Player 2, your knight is at (5, 5)."

## Strategy Tips

- **Control the Center**: Moving your knight toward the center can increase your options while limiting your opponent's.
- **Anticipate Moves**: Try to predict where your opponent can move and cut off those paths.
- **Conserve Squares**: Avoid unnecessary moves that remove vital squares needed for future moves.
- **Forced Moves**: Put your opponent in positions where their moves are limited to a few options, making it easier to trap them.
