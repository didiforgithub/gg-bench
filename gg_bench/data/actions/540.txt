In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(16)`, representing the 16 cells of the 4x4 matrix. Each action corresponds to selecting a specific cell, with action indices mapping to grid positions as follows:

- Actions are numbered from 0 to 15.
- Each action index can be converted to a matrix position using integer division and modulus operations:
  - Row index: `row = action // 4`
  - Column index: `col = action % 4`
- For example, action `0` maps to cell `(Row 0, Col 0)`, action `1` to `(Row 0, Col 1)`, etc., continuing sequentially through action `15` which maps to `(Row 3, Col 3)`.
