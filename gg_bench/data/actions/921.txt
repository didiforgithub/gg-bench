In the game environment, actions correspond to selecting proper divisors of the current number. The action space uses indices to represent these moves. Each action index \(n\) corresponds to a divisor \(d = n + 2\), where \(n\) ranges from 0 to \((\text{max\_number} - 2)\). This mapping is because 1 is not allowed as a divisor and action indices start from 0. The divisor \(d\) for an action is hence \(d = n + 2\), effectively aligning action indices with possible divisors starting from 2.
