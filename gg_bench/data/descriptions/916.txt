# Lockdown

## Objective

Be the first player to collect three numbers that sum exactly to **15**. Strategic selection and planning are key, as each number can only be chosen once. The game requires careful observation of both your own picks and your opponent's moves.

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: A shared pool containing the numbers **1** through **9**, each available only once.
- **Players**: Two players are required. Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Player 1 takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**:
  - Numbers **1** to **9** are placed in the pool.
  - Each number is unique and can be selected only once.

- **Player Collections**:
  - Each player has their own collection where they keep their chosen numbers.
  - Collections start empty.

## Turns

- Players take turns one after the other.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Selection Phase**: The active player selects one number from the number pool.
  2. **Acquisition Phase**: The selected number is moved from the pool to the player's collection.
  3. **Update Phase**: Check if the player has collected three numbers that sum to **15**.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, select any available number from the pool.
   - Once a number is selected, it is no longer available for either player.

2. **Building Collections**:
   - Each player aims to collect exactly **three** numbers.
   - The goal is for these three numbers to sum to **15**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player whose collection contains exactly three numbers summing to **15** wins the game immediately.
   - If a player exceeds three numbers without summing to **15**, they continue playing to block the opponent.

4. **Game End Without a Direct Win**:
   - If all numbers have been selected and neither player has exactly three numbers summing to **15**, the winner is determined by:
     - **Closest Sum**: The player with a total sum **closest to 15 without exceeding it** wins.
     - **Tie-breaker**: If both players have the same sum, the player with the **lowest individual number** in their collection wins.
     - **No Draws**: The rules ensure that there is always a winner.

5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Be mindful of the numbers your opponent selects to anticipate their potential to sum to **15**.
   - You may need to block your opponent by selecting numbers they need.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Achieve a collection of exactly three numbers that sum to **15**.
- **Alternate Winning Condition**: If no player sums to **15**, have the closest sum to **15** without exceeding it.
- **Tie-breaker**: Lowest individual number in the collection.
