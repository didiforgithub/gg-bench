**Game Name: Last Bit Standing**

---

**Objective:**

The objective of *Last Bit Standing* is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move without creating a binary number that is divisible by 3. The player who successfully compels their opponent to create such a number, thereby leaving them without a valid move, wins the game.

---

**Setup:**

- **Starting Binary Number**: The game begins with a shared binary number, initially set to `"1"`.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Turn Order**: Players decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined by mutual agreement or a random method like flipping a coin.

---

**Game Components:**

- **Shared Binary Number**: A sequence of binary digits (bits), starting with `"1"`, which both players will build upon during the game.
- **Bits**: The binary digits `"0"` and `"1"` that players will append to the shared binary number.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via text input and output, with players entering their chosen bits during their turns.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Player Action**:
   - On their turn, a player must choose to append either a `"0"` or a `"1"` to the current binary number.
   - The choice is made by entering the bit (`0` or `1`) into the command line when prompted.

2. **Validating Moves**:
   - After appending the chosen bit, the new binary number is evaluated.
   - If the decimal equivalent of the new binary number is **not divisible by 3**, the move is valid, and the game proceeds.
   - If the new binary number is divisible by 3, the move is invalid, and the player loses the game.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Players alternate turns, continually appending bits to the binary number, until a player loses as per the rules.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Binary Number Construction**:
   - The binary number always starts with `"1"`.
   - Players can only append bits to the **right end** of the binary number.
   - The binary number grows by one bit each turn.

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if, after appending the chosen bit, the binary number converted to decimal is **not divisible by 3**.

3. **Invalid Moves and Losing**:
   - If appending either a `"0"` or a `"1"` results in a binary number that is divisible by 3, the player has no valid moves and loses the game.
   - The game cannot end in a draw.

4. **Number Conversion**:
   - Players may convert the binary number to its decimal equivalent to check for divisibility by 3.
   - Example: Binary `"110"` equals decimal `6`. Since `6` is divisible by `3`, appending bits to create `"110"` would be an invalid move.

5. **Strategic Play**:
   - Players can plan ahead by considering how their choice of bit affects future moves.
   - Anticipating the opponent's options can provide a strategic advantage.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move wins the game.
- **No Points System**:
  - The game does not involve points or scoring beyond identifying the winner.
