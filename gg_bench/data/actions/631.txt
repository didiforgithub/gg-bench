In the game, each action space index corresponds to a specific prime number available for subtraction. The mapping is a one-to-one relationship where each index in the action space represents a position in the list of primes. Here's the direct mapping:

- Index 0: Prime 2
- Index 1: Prime 3
- Index 2: Prime 5
- Index 3: Prime 7
- Index 4: Prime 11
- Index 5: Prime 13
- Index 6: Prime 17
- Index 7: Prime 19

Players select an action space index corresponding to the prime they wish to subtract from the current total, ensuring the move is valid according to game rules.
