In the game environment, each action corresponds to one of the 36 indices in the action space, ranging from 0 to 35. These indices map directly to the positions on the 6x6 grid. The index is converted to a grid position using the following formula:

- **Row**: `index // 6`
- **Column**: `index % 6`

For example, an action with index 0 corresponds to the position (0, 0) on the grid, and an action with index 35 corresponds to the position (5, 5). This mapping effectively allows each index to specify a unique cell on the game board where a player can place their block.
