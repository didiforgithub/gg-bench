In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 9, each corresponding to a specific number on the circle. The mapping works as follows:
- Index 0 corresponds to selecting number 1.
- Index 1 corresponds to selecting number 2.
- Index 2 corresponds to selecting number 3.
- Index 3 corresponds to selecting number 4.
- Index 4 corresponds to selecting number 5.
- Index 5 corresponds to selecting number 6.
- Index 6 corresponds to selecting number 7.
- Index 7 corresponds to selecting number 8.
- Index 8 corresponds to selecting number 9.
- Index 9 corresponds to selecting number 10.

This mapping is achieved by converting the action index (`action`) to the corresponding number using the formula `number = action + 1`.
