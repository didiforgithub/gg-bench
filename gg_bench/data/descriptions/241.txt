# Duel of Wits

## Objective

**Duel of Wits** is a strategic two-player turn-based game designed for play in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach a cumulative total of exactly **50** by strategically choosing actions that increase the total without exceeding it. Players must outmaneuver their opponent by anticipating moves and planning ahead.

## Setup

- **Cumulative Total**: The game starts with a shared cumulative total set to **0**.
- **Player Roles**: Two players, Player 1 and Player 2, decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Total**: A shared numeric value that both players can view and modify through their actions.
- **Actions**: Two possible actions for each player on their turn:
  - **Add**: Add an integer between **1** and **10** (inclusive) to the cumulative total.
  - **Multiply**: Multiply the cumulative total by **2**, provided the result does not exceed **50**.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately, starting with the player who was chosen to go first.
- On each turn, a player **must** perform one of the two available actions:
  1. **Add** a number to the cumulative total.
  2. **Multiply** the cumulative total by 2.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Adding Numbers

- **Action**: Add any integer from **1** to **10** (inclusive) to the cumulative total.
- **Restriction**: The cumulative total **must not exceed 50** after the addition.
- **Procedure**:
  - Player announces the number they wish to add.
  - The number is added to the cumulative total immediately.

### 2. Multiplying the Total

- **Action**: Multiply the cumulative total by **2**.
- **Restriction**: The result of the multiplication **must not exceed 50**.
- **Procedure**:
  - Player declares their intention to multiply.
  - The cumulative total is multiplied by 2 immediately.

### 3. Exceeding 50

- If a player's chosen action would cause the cumulative total to exceed **50**, that action is **not allowed**.
- If a player has **no legal moves** (i.e., all possible actions would exceed 50), the player **loses the game**.

### 4. Winning the Game

- The player who brings the cumulative total to **exactly 50** **wins** the game.
- Players must plan their moves to force the cumulative total to 50 on their turn.

### 5. Mandatory Actions

- Players **cannot skip** their turn.
- If a player has at least one legal action, they **must** perform one.
- If **no legal actions** are available, the player **loses**, and the opponent wins.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Achieved by reaching a cumulative total of exactly **50**.
- **Losing**: Occurs if a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.

## Examples

### Example 1: Strategic Play

**Starting Cumulative Total**: 0

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Add 7**.
  - Cumulative Total: 0 + 7 = **7**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Add 8**.
  - Cumulative Total: 7 + 8 = **15**.
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Multiply**.
  - Cumulative Total: 15 × 2 = **30**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Add 10**.
  - Cumulative Total: 30 + 10 = **40**.
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Multiplying would result in 80 (not allowed).
  - Chooses to **Add 10**.
  - Cumulative Total: 40 + 10 = **50**.
- **Outcome**: **Player 1 wins** by reaching exactly 50.

### Example 2: Forcing a Win

**Starting Cumulative Total**: 0

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Add 1**.
  - Cumulative Total: 0 + 1 = **1**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Multiply**.
  - Cumulative Total: 1 × 2 = **2**.
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Add 3**.
  - Cumulative Total: 2 + 3 = **5**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Multiply**.
  - Cumulative Total: 5 × 2 = **10**.
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Add 10**.
  - Cumulative Total: 10 + 10 = **20**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Chooses to **Multiply**.
  - Cumulative Total: 20 × 2 = **40**.
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Cannot multiply (would be 80).
  - Chooses to **Add 9**.
  - Cumulative Total: 40 + 9 = **49**.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Cannot multiply (would be 98).
  - Must add between 1 and 1 (since any higher exceeds 50).
  - Chooses to **Add 1**.
  - Cumulative Total: 49 + 1 = **50**.
- **Outcome**: **Player 2 wins** by reaching exactly 50.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample command-line interaction to illustrate how the game might proceed.

```
Game Start! Cumulative Total is 0.

Player 1's Turn:
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 1
Enter a number to add (1-10): 6
Cumulative Total is now 6.

Player 2's Turn:
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 2
Cumulative Total is now 12.

Player 1's Turn:
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 2
Cumulative Total is now 24.

Player 2's Turn:
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 1
Enter a number to add (1-10): 10
Cumulative Total is now 34.

Player 1's Turn:
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 2
Action not allowed. Multiplying would exceed 50.
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 1
Enter a number to add (1-10): 10
Cumulative Total is now 44.

Player 2's Turn:
Choose Action - (1) Add or (2) Multiply: 1
Enter a number to add (1-6): 6
Cumulative Total is now 50.

Player 2 wins by reaching exactly 50!
```

*Note*: In the final turn, Player 2 could only add a maximum of 6, as adding more would exceed 50.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of both adding and multiplying to control the cumulative total.
- **Force Moves**: Try to leave the cumulative total at a number where your opponent has limited options.
- **Avoid High Totals Early**: Keeping the cumulative total lower gives you more flexibility in later moves.
- **Watch Multiplication**: Multiplying can quickly increase the total but can also reduce your options.
