In the gym environment for **Multiplier Showdown**, the action space consists of indices ranging from 0 to 7, corresponding to a Discrete space of size 8. Each index maps to a game move by representing multipliers from 2 to 9. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2, action index 1 to a multiplier of 3, and so forth, up to action index 7, which corresponds to a multiplier of 9. Thus, the mapping from action space index \(a\) to the multiplier is given by the formula \(m = a + 2\), where \(m\) is the multiplier applied to the current number.
