The action space indices in the gym environment correspond to possible divisors that players can choose in the game. Specifically, each action index `a` maps to a divisor `d = a + 2`, because divisors range from 2 to 100 (actions are indexed from 0 to 98). This mapping ensures each action is associated with a unique divisor, simplifying the process of checking valid moves and applying them to the shared number.
