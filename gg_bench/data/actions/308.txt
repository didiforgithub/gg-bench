In the game "Sequence Duel," the action space indices directly correspond to the positions on the number line from 1 to 20. The action space is defined as a discrete space with 20 possible actions, where each action index (ranging from 0 to 19) represents the integer corresponding to its 1-based index position on the number line. For example, action index 0 corresponds to claiming the number 1, index 1 corresponds to number 2, and so on, up to index 19, which corresponds to number 20. This mapping allows the players to select and claim numbers by their indices within the code.
