The action space in the game is represented by four discrete indices, each mapping to a specific direction of movement for the player's light cycle on the grid:
- `0`: Move up (decrease row index by 1)
- `1`: Move down (increase row index by 1)
- `2`: Move left (decrease column index by 1)
- `3`: Move right (increase column index by 1)
