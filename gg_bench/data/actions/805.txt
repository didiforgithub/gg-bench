The action space in the game is defined as `Discrete(19)`, where each action index corresponds to a move by mapping it to a number between 2 and 20 inclusive. Specifically, an action index `i` maps to the move of selecting the number `i + 2`. For example, an action index of 0 corresponds to choosing the number 2, an index of 1 corresponds to choosing the number 3, and so on, up to an index of 18, which corresponds to choosing the number 20.
