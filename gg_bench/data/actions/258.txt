The action space indices in the game are mapped directly to the numbers in the shared pool. Specifically, index 0 corresponds to the number 2, index 1 to the number 3, and so on, up to index 8, which corresponds to the number 10. This is achieved by adding 2 to the action index to determine the actual number to select from the pool.
