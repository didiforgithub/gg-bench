The action space indices in the environment directly correspond to the number values present in the pool. Each index represents a possible integer number value, starting from 0 up to the `max_number_value`, which is 20 in this case. A valid action is selecting an index where the respective number's count in the observation is at least 2, indicating that the player can choose to merge two identical numbers of that index value. For example, if a player selects an action with index 2, it means they intend to merge two `2`s in the pool, provided that at least two `2`s are available.
