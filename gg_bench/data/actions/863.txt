In the game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete set with two possible actions, indexed as follows: 

- **Index 0:** Represents the "Add 1" operation, which adds 1 to the current number.
- **Index 1:** Represents the "Multiply by 2" operation, which multiplies the current number by 2.
