### **Objective**

The objective of **Number Bid** is to accumulate the highest total score by strategically bidding numbers from a shared pool. Players compete over multiple rounds, aiming to win rounds and earn points. The player with the highest cumulative score at the end of the game wins.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Numbers Pool:** Create a shared pool of numbers from **1 to 10**.
2. **Players:** Two players participate in the game.
3. **Scoreboard:** Establish a method to keep track of each player's cumulative score (e.g., paper and pen, digital notepad).
4. **Starting Conditions:** Both players have access to the full pool of numbers at the beginning. Decide on a method for simultaneous bidding (e.g., write bids privately and reveal them together).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Numbers Pool (1-10):** A set of numbers available for both players to bid. Each number can be used only once.
- **Scoreboard:** A record-keeping system to track each player's cumulative points throughout the game.
- **Bidding Mechanism:** A way for players to select and submit their bids secretly and simultaneously.
- **Rounds:** The game is played over multiple rounds until all numbers have been bid.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Bidding Phase:**
   - Both players **simultaneously** select a number from the available pool.
   - Players keep their bids secret until both have made a selection.
2. **Reveal Phase:**
   - Both bids are revealed at the same time.
3. **Resolution Phase:**
   - Determine the winner of the round based on the bids.
   - Update scores accordingly.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Bidding Rules:**
   - Players must bid a number from the **available pool**.
   - Each number can be bid **only once**. Once a number is bid, it is **removed from the pool**.
   - Bids are made **secretly and simultaneously**.

2. **Winning a Round:**
   - The player who bids the **higher number** wins the round.
   - The winner scores points equal to the **sum of both bids**.
   - If both players bid the **same number**, the round is a tie:
     - **No points** are awarded to either player.
     - The bid numbers are still **removed from the pool**.

3. **Scoring:**
   - **Winner's Points:** Sum of both bids.
   - **Tie:** No points awarded.

4. **Removing Numbers:**
   - After each round, the two numbers that were bid are **removed from the pool**, reducing the options for subsequent rounds.

5. **End of the Game:**
   - The game ends when **all numbers have been bid**.
   - The player with the **highest cumulative score** wins.
   - If both players have the **same total score**, the game is a draw (though draws are unlikely due to the game's mechanics).

6. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Players must decide **when** to use high numbers to win valuable rounds and **when** to conserve them.
   - Anticipate the opponent's potential bids based on the remaining numbers.

### **Scoring**

- **Winning a Round:**

- **Cumulative Score:**
  - Keep a running total of each player's score after each round.
  - Update the scoreboard accordingly.

- **Determining the Winner:**
