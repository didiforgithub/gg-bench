In the Adjacency Block game, each index in the action space corresponds directly to a specific cell position on the linear grid. The action space consists of discrete values ranging from 0 to 9, where each index represents the position number minus one (i.e., action 0 corresponds to position 1, action 1 corresponds to position 2, ..., action 9 corresponds to position 10). When a player takes a turn, they select an index from the action space, which signifies their intent to place a token in the corresponding cell on the grid.
