# Crossed Paths - Rule Book

## Objective

**Crossed Paths** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a 7x7 grid. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move according to the game rules. The player who successfully does so wins the game.

---

## Setup

- **Game Grid**: A 7x7 grid consisting of 7 rows (numbered 1 to 7 from top to bottom) and 7 columns (labeled A to G from left to right).
- **Markers**: Each player chooses a unique marker to represent their moves on the grid:
  - Player 1: `X`
  - Player 2: `O`
- **Starting the Game**:
  - Decide which player will go first (e.g., by coin toss).
  - The grid starts empty with all cells unoccupied.

---

## Game Components

- **7x7 Grid**:
  - Cells are identified by their column letter and row number (e.g., `D4`).
  - The grid coordinates help players identify valid moves.

- **Player Markers**:
  - `X` for Player 1.
  - `O` for Player 2.
  - Markers are placed on the grid to occupy cells.

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Players interact with the game by entering commands in the command line.
  - The grid is displayed in text format after each move.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

- **Structure of a Turn**:
  1. **Prompt**: The game prompts the current player to make a move.
  2. **Input**: The player inputs the cell where they wish to place their marker (e.g., `D4`).
  3. **Validation**: The game checks if the move is valid according to the game rules.
     - If the move is valid, the marker is placed on the grid.
     - If invalid, the player is informed and prompted to make a valid move.
  4. **Display**: The updated grid is displayed.
  5. **Next Turn**: The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **First Move**:
   - Player 1 can place their `X` marker on **any** empty cell on the grid.

2. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - On each turn after the first, the player must place their marker on an empty cell that is in the **same row**, **same column**, or **same diagonal** as the **last cell** occupied by the opponent.
   - **Rows and Columns**:
     - Same row: Any cell with the same row number.
     - Same column: Any cell with the same column letter.
   - **Diagonals**:
     - Cells that are diagonally connected, forming a line from top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left through the opponent's last move.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - The chosen cell must be **empty**.
   - It must be in the same row, column, or diagonal as the opponent's last move.
   - If there are multiple options, the player can choose any that meet the criteria.

4. **Inability to Move**:
   - If a player has **no valid moves** (no empty cells in the required row, column, or diagonals), they lose the game.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.

5. **Prohibited Moves**:
   - Players cannot place a marker on an occupied cell.
   - Players cannot skip their turn.

### Special Cases

- **No Available Moves from the Start**:
  - If after the first player's move, the second player has no valid moves (this is possible if the grid is very small or certain cells are blocked), the second player loses.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The game is won by the player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.
