In this Factor Duel gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to the `max_starting_number` (1000 by default). Each index in the action space represents a potential factor that a player can choose on their turn, although only indices corresponding to valid factors of the current shared number are considered valid moves. The valid moves exclude indices representing 1 or the number itself, as these are not allowed choices in the game. The player's chosen action must thus divide the shared number exactly (without remainder) to be valid, with any invalid actions resulting in a loss for that player.
