# Sequence Duel

## Objective

Sequence Duel is a strategic two-player turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to collect three numbers that form an arithmetic sequence from a shared pool of numbers. An arithmetic sequence consists of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive numbers (e.g., 2, 4, 6 or 3, 5, 7). Victory is achieved by successfully collecting such a sequence before your opponent.

## Setup

- **Shared Pool**: The game begins with a shared pool of numbers ranging from **1** to **9**.
- **Player Hands**: Both players start with empty hands.
- **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by mutual agreement or a random method).

## Game Components

- **Numbers (1-9)**: These are the core elements of the game. Each number is unique and can only be selected once. They are displayed in the shared pool for both players to see.
- **Player Hands**: Each player has a hand where they collect their chosen numbers. The contents of each player's hand are visible to both players to maintain transparency and strategic planning.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- **During a Turn**:
  - The player selects **any remaining number** from the shared pool.
  - The chosen number is added to the player's hand.
  - The selected number is **removed** from the shared pool.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - The game continues with players selecting numbers one after the other until a player achieves victory.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can choose any number from the shared pool on their turn.
   - Each number can only be selected once and is then unavailable for the rest of the game.

2. **Forming an Arithmetic Sequence**:
   - The primary objective is to collect **three numbers** that can form an arithmetic sequence.
   - The sequence does **not** need to be in the order the numbers were picked.
   - The difference between the numbers can be positive or negative but must be consistent.
   - Examples of valid sequences:
     - 2, 4, 6 (common difference of 2)
     - 9, 6, 3 (common difference of -3)
     - 1, 4, 7 (common difference of 3)

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have three numbers in their hand that form an arithmetic sequence wins immediately.
   - The game ends upon a victory condition being met.

4. **Game End without Immediate Victory**:
   - If all numbers have been selected and neither player has formed an arithmetic sequence:
     - The player with the **highest sum** of numbers in their hand wins.
     - If the sums are equal, the player who **picked second** (the player who took the last turn) wins the game.

5. **Transparency**:
   - Players' hands are visible to both players at all times.
   - This allows for strategic planning and anticipation of the opponent's moves.

## Scoring

- **Victory by Sequence**:
  - Achieved by forming an arithmetic sequence of three numbers.
  - This is the primary method of winning.

- **Victory by Sum**:
  - If no arithmetic sequence is formed, victory is determined by the highest total sum of numbers in a player's hand.
  - This secondary condition ensures that every game ends decisively with no draws.

## Strategy Tips

- **Blocking**: Pay attention to the numbers your opponent is collecting and pick numbers that might prevent them from forming a sequence.
- **Prioritizing**: Select numbers that can contribute to multiple potential sequences to increase your chances of winning.
- **Awareness**: Keep track of the remaining numbers in the shared pool to anticipate possible moves.

## Game Variations

- **Extended Range**: Increase the shared pool to numbers from 1 to 11 to allow for longer sequences and more complex strategies.
- **Sequence Length**: Change the required sequence length to four numbers for a more challenging game.

## Conclusion

Sequence Duel is a quick and engaging game that combines elements of strategy, planning, and foresight. It's simple to learn but offers depth for players to develop their skills. With no possibility of a draw, each game concludes decisively, allowing skilled players to consistently demonstrate their prowess.

Happy dueling!
