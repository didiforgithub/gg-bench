In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, representing 10 possible actions corresponding to the indices 0 through 9. Each index directly maps to the selection of a number on the number line, where action index `i` corresponds to claiming the number `i + 1` on the line. Thus, selecting action 0 claims number 1, action 1 claims number 2, and so on, up to action 9 claiming number 10. Each action marks the chosen position on the number line with the current player's marker (`1` for Player 1 and `-1` for Player 2).
