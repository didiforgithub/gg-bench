In the action space, indices map to moves as follows: each pair of indices represents a number from 1 to 9, with the lower index (even) corresponding to adding the number and the higher index (odd) corresponding to subtracting the number. Specifically, index 0 maps to adding 1, index 1 to subtracting 1, index 2 to adding 2, index 3 to subtracting 2, and so forth, up to index 16 for adding 9 and index 17 for subtracting 9.
