The action space indices in the provided gym environment map directly to numbers selected from the number pool in the game. Specifically, actions are represented as integers from 0 to 9, where each index corresponds to selecting a number that is one unit higher. Thus, an action index of 0 selects the number 1, an index of 1 selects the number 2, and so forth, up to an index of 9 which selects the number 10. This mapping allows players to choose a number from 1 to 10 by simply performing an action corresponding to the index within the action space.
