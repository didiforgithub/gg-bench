The action space consists of 48 discrete actions mapped to combinations of movement directions and battle options. These are structured as follows:

- **Movement (8 options)**: Each direction corresponds to an index from 0 to 7:
  - 0: Up (-1, 0)
  - 1: Down (1, 0)
  - 2: Left (0, -1)
  - 3: Right (0, 1)
  - 4: Up-Left (-1, -1)
  - 5: Up-Right (-1, 1)
  - 6: Down-Left (1, -1)
  - 7: Down-Right (1, 1)

- **Battle Options (6 options)**: Each movement has 6 possible battle actions:
  - 0: No battle
  - 1 to 5: Battle numbers 1 to 5

Each action space index is given by `movement_action * 6 + battle_option`, resulting in a total of 48 distinct actions for all combinations.
