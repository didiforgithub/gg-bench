# Sequence Math Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the **Target Number** exactly by sequentially applying arithmetic operations to your **Current Number**. Strategically choose your operations to outmaneuver your opponent without exceeding the target. If your **Current Number** exceeds the **Target Number**, you lose immediately.

## Setup

1. **Target Number**: Decide on a target number for the game, e.g., **20**. This number should be agreed upon by both players before starting. For a quicker game, choose a smaller target number; for a longer game, choose a larger one.
   
2. **Starting Number**: Both players begin with a **Current Number** of **1**.

3. **Player Order**: Determine who goes first (e.g., flip a coin).

## Game Components

- **Target Number**: The number both players aim to reach exactly.
  
- **Current Number**: Each player's individual number that they will manipulate on their turns. Both players start at **1**.
  
- **Operations**:
  - **Addition (+)**: Add **1** to your Current Number.
  - **Multiplication (×)**: Multiply your Current Number by **2**.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
  
- **On Your Turn**:
  1. **Choose an Operation**: Decide to either **add 1** or **multiply by 2** to apply to your Current Number.
     
  2. **Update Your Current Number**: Perform the chosen operation on your Current Number.
     
  3. **Announce Your Move**: State the operation performed and your new Current Number.
     
  4. **Check for Victory or Loss**:
     - **Victory**: If your Current Number exactly equals the Target Number, you win!
     - **Loss**: If your Current Number exceeds the Target Number, you lose immediately.
     
- **Example Turn**:
  - "I choose to multiply by 2. My Current Number is now 4."

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Operations Available**:
   - **Add 1**: Increment your Current Number by 1.
   - **Multiply by 2**: Multiply your Current Number by 2.
   
2. **Restrictions**:
   - You must perform exactly one operation on your turn.
   - You cannot skip your turn.
   - No other operations are allowed besides adding 1 or multiplying by 2.
   
3. **Current Number**:
   - Keep track of your own Current Number separately from your opponent.
   - Each player manipulates only their own Current Number.
   
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach the Target Number exactly wins.
   
5. **Losing the Game**:
   - If your Current Number exceeds the Target Number, you lose immediately, and the opponent wins.
   
6. **Draws**:
   - Draws are not possible in this game under normal play.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Successfully reaching the Target Number exactly on your turn.
  
- **Losing**: Exceeding the Target Number with your Current Number.

- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of wins for each player.
  - First to win a predetermined number of rounds wins the match.

## Example Game

- **Target Number**: 20
- **Player 1 Current Number**: Starts at 1
- **Player 2 Current Number**: Starts at 1

### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to multiply by 2.
   - Current Number: 1 × 2 = **2**
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 2."
   
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses to multiply by 2.
   - Current Number: 1 × 2 = **2**
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 2."
   
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to add 1.
   - Current Number: 2 + 1 = **3**
   - Announces: "Added 1, my number is now 3."
   
4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses to multiply by 2.
   - Current Number: 2 × 2 = **4**
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 4."
   
5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to multiply by 2.
   - Current Number: 3 × 2 = **6**
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 6."
   
6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses to add 1.
   - Current Number: 4 + 1 = **5**
   - Announces: "Added 1, my number is now 5."
   
7. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to multiply by 2.
   - Current Number: 6 × 2 = **12**
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 12."
   
8. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses to multiply by 2.
   - Current Number: 5 × 2 = **10**
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 10."
   
9. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to add 1.
   - Current Number: 12 + 1 = **13**
   - Announces: "Added 1, my number is now 13."
   
10. **Player 2's Turn**:
    - Chooses to multiply by 2.
    - Current Number: 10 × 2 = **20**
    - Announces: "Multiplied by 2, my number is now 20."
    - **Victory!** Player 2 has reached the Target Number exactly.
    
- **Result**: Player 2 wins the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Suppose you're implementing this game in a command-line interface. Below is how the interaction might look:

```
--- Sequence Math Duel ---

Target Number is 20.

Player 1, it's your turn.
Your Current Number: 1
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Multiply by 2
Enter 1 or 2: 2
You chose to multiply by 2.
Your Current Number is now 2.

Player 2, it's your turn.
Your Current Number: 1
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Multiply by 2
Enter 1 or 2: 2
You chose to multiply by 2.
Your Current Number is now 2.

Player 1, it's your turn.
Your Current Number: 2
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Multiply by 2
Enter 1 or 2:
```

*...and so on, until a player reaches the Target Number or exceeds it.*

## Strategy Tips

- **Planning Ahead**: Consider the possible results of your operations and anticipate your opponent's moves.
  
- **Avoid Exceeding the Target**: Be cautious not to overshoot the Target Number, especially as your Current Number gets close.
  
- **Force Your Opponent's Hand**: Try to put your opponent in a position where their only moves would cause them to exceed the Target Number.
  
- **Operation Choice**: Early in the game, multiplying by 2 can quickly increase your Current Number, but adding 1 gives finer control as you approach the target.

## Conclusion

Sequence Math Duel is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to use arithmetic operations thoughtfully to reach a common goal. With each player only able to influence their own number, the focus is on planning and foresight. Enjoy outsmarting your opponent in this battle of numerical wits!
