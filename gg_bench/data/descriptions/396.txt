# Crystal Capture: Rule Book

## Objective

**Crystal Capture** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to collect exactly **15 Crystal Points** by capturing crystals from a shared pool. Players must carefully choose which crystals to capture while anticipating their opponent's moves. The game ends quickly, and a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled player.

## Setup

- **Crystal Pool**: The game begins with a shared pool of crystals numbered from **1** to **9**.
- **Player Points**: Both players start with **0 Crystal Points**.
- **Turn Order**: Determine randomly which player goes first.

## Game Components

### Crystals

- **Crystals Numbered 1-9**: Each crystal has a unique number from **1** to **9**.
- **Appearance**: Represented numerically in the command-line interface (e.g., `1`, `2`, ..., `9`).
- **Functionality**: Each crystal's number indicates its **Crystal Points** value when captured.
- **Unique Attributes**: Once a crystal is captured, it is removed from the pool and cannot be chosen again.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Display Available Crystals**: At the start of each turn, the available crystals in the pool are shown.
2. **Player Action**: The current player chooses one crystal from the pool to capture.
3. **Update Points**: The chosen crystal's points are added to the player's total Crystal Points.
4. **Check for Win Condition**: After the capture, check if the player's total Crystal Points equal exactly **15**.
5. **Next Player's Turn**: If the game hasn't ended, the turn passes to the other player.

### Player Actions During Turn

- **Capture a Crystal**: Select one available crystal from the pool to add its points to your total.
- **Strategic Planning**: Consider which crystals remain and plan to reach exactly 15 points before your opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Crystal Selection**: On your turn, you **must** capture one crystal from the pool.
2. **Point Accumulation**: Add the value of the captured crystal to your total Crystal Points.
3. **Win Condition**: The first player to reach **exactly 15 Crystal Points** wins the game.
4. **Cannot Exceed 15**: If capturing a crystal would cause your total points to exceed 15, you **cannot** select that crystal.
5. **Forced Moves**: If there are crystals you can legally capture (without exceeding 15), you **must** choose one. If no legal moves are available, you pass your turn.
6. **No Draws**: The game continues until one player reaches exactly 15 points. Given the limited number of crystals and the rules, a draw is impossible.

### Special Mechanics

- **Anticipation**: Players must anticipate their opponent's potential moves to block them from reaching 15 points first.
- **Denial Strategy**: Capture crystals that your opponent may need to reach 15 points.

### Interaction Between Components

- **Crystal Availability**: The pool diminishes as crystals are captured, altering the strategic landscape each turn.
- **Point Totals**: Keep track of both players' point totals to inform your strategy.

## Scoring

- **Crystal Points**: The values of the crystals captured by a player.
- **Winning the Game**: Achieved by accumulating exactly **15 Crystal Points**.
- **Tracking Points**: Each player's total is updated and displayed after every turn.
