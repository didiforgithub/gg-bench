# **Double or Nothing**

## **Objective**

The primary goal of "Double or Nothing" is to be the first player to reach **exactly 20** by incrementally increasing a shared number through strategic choices. Players take turns either adding **1** or **doubling** the current number. The player who reaches the number 20 exactly on their turn **wins** the game. If a player's move causes the number to exceed 20, they **lose** immediately.

## **Setup**

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with the number set to **1**.
2. **Players**: Two players are required. Player 1 and Player 2.
3. **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first (Player 1) and second (Player 2), perhaps by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

## **Game Components**

- **Shared Number**: This is a single integer that both players can see and modify. It starts at **1** and is updated after each turn based on player actions.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played in a command-line environment where players input their choices, and the current number is displayed after each turn.

## **Turns**

1. **Player's Choice**: On their turn, a player must choose one of the following actions:

   - **Add One**: Increment the current number by **1**.
   - **Double It**: Multiply the current number by **2**.

2. **Input**: The player inputs their choice into the command line.

3. **Update**: The game updates the current number based on the player's action.

4. **Display**: The new current number is displayed.

5. **Turn Progression**: The turn passes to the next player.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

- **Valid Actions**: On each turn, a player must choose to either **add one** or **double** the current number.
- **Winning the Game**:

  - If a player reaches **exactly 20** on their turn, they **win**.
  - If a player's action causes the current number to exceed **20**, they **lose** immediately, and the other player **wins**.

- **Invalid Moves**: If a player inputs an invalid action (anything other than "add" or "double"), they are prompted again.
- **Example Actions**:

  - If the current number is 7:

    - **Add One**: The new number becomes 8.
    - **Double It**: The new number becomes 14.

- **Strategic Depth**: Players must plan ahead to avoid exceeding 20 while trying to force their opponent into a losing position.

## **Scoring**

- **Win/Loss**: The game uses a simple win/loss outcome.
  - **Winner**: The player who reaches exactly 20 or causes their opponent to exceed 20.
  - **Loser**: The player who exceeds 20 or fails to prevent the opponent from reaching 20.

- **No Points System**: There is no points accumulation; the focus is on winning each game.

## **Strategy Tips**

- **Avoid Exceeding 20**: Always consider the result of your action to prevent the number from going over 20.
- **Force Your Opponent's Moves**: Try to leave the current number at a value where any action by your opponent could cause them to lose.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by calculating possible outcomes for both adding one and doubling.

## **Game Flow Summary**

1. Start at number 1.
2. Players alternate turns, choosing to either add one or double the current number.
3. The game continues until a player reaches exactly 20 (and wins) or exceeds 20 (and loses).
4. The game is quick, strategic, and allows skilled players to plan winning moves.
