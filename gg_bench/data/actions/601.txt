In the given code, the action space indices range from 0 to 15, representing the 16 cells of the 4x4 grid. The mapping is as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to cell A1,
- Index 1 corresponds to cell B1,
- Index 2 corresponds to cell C1,
- Index 3 corresponds to cell D1,
- Index 4 corresponds to cell A2,
- Index 5 corresponds to cell B2,
- Index 6 corresponds to cell C2,
- Index 7 corresponds to cell D2,
- Index 8 corresponds to cell A3,
- Index 9 corresponds to cell B3,
- Index 10 corresponds to cell C3,
- Index 11 corresponds to cell D3,
- Index 12 corresponds to cell A4,
- Index 13 corresponds to cell B4,
- Index 14 corresponds to cell C4,
- Index 15 corresponds to cell D4.

Each index represents placing a marker in the respective cell on the grid.
