In the Sum Battle game, the action space indices in the gym environment correspond directly to the numbers available for selection from the shared pool. The action space is discrete with 9 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 8. Each index maps to a number in the range 1 to 9. Specifically, action index `i` represents the selection of the number `i + 1` from the shared pool. If an index is chosen as an action, the respective number (`index + 1`) is selected by the current player, and removed from the pool, updating the player's cumulative score. If the number is unavailable (already selected in a previous turn), the action is invalid.
