# Sequence Stack - Rule Book

## Objective

Sequence Stack is a two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to build a sequential stack of numbers from 1 to 5. By strategically managing drawn numbers and blocking their opponent's progress, players aim to complete their ascending sequence before their opponent does. The primary goal is to build a personal stack with the numbers **1, 2, 3, 4, 5** in exact ascending order.

## Setup

1. **Game Components Initialization**:
   - **Shared Deck**: Create a deck consisting of numbered cards from **1** to **5**, with **two copies** of each number, totaling **10 cards**.
   - **Player Stacks**: Each player has their own stack area (initially empty) where they will place their sequence of numbers.
   - **Discard Pile**: An area designated for discarded cards.

2. **Deck Preparation**:
   - Shuffle the shared deck thoroughly.
   - Place the shuffled deck face-down within reach of both players.

3. **Player Positions**:
   - Decide which player will take the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
   - Players should be seated so that both have easy access to the deck and can view the discard pile.

## Game Components

- **Numbered Cards**:
  - **Quantity**: Two of each number from **1** to **5**.
  - **Appearance**: Each card displays a clear, bold number between **1** and **5**.
  - **Functionality**: Used to build sequences in player stacks or to block the opponent when discarded.

- **Player Stacks**:
  - **Purpose**: Personal area where players build their ascending sequence from **1** to **5**.
  - **Rules**:
    - Numbers must be placed in exact ascending order starting from **1**.
    - Only one instance of each number can be in the stack.

- **Discard Pile**:
  - **Purpose**: Holds cards that have been discarded by players.
  - **Functionality**:
    - Discarded cards **block** the opponent from using that specific number in their sequence.
    - A blocked number cannot be placed into the opponent's stack for the remainder of the game.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Draw Phase**: The active player draws the top card from the deck.
  2. **Decision Phase**: The player decides to either place or discard the drawn card.
     - **Place**: If the card is the next required number in their sequence, they may place it on top of their stack.
     - **Discard**: If they cannot use the card or choose to block the opponent, they discard it to the discard pile.
  3. **Turn End**: The turn passes to the other player.

- **Order of Actions**:
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - No skipping of turns is permitted unless the deck is depleted.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Building the Sequence**:
   - Players must start their stack with the number **1** and build in exact ascending order up to **5**.
   - A player cannot place a number if the preceding number in the sequence is not already in their stack.

2. **Placing Cards**:
   - **Valid Placement**: A drawn card can only be placed if it is the next number required in the player's sequence.
     - Example: If a player's top card is **2**, they can only place a **3** next.
   - **Invalid Placement**: If the drawn card is not the next required number, it cannot be placed and may be discarded.

3. **Discarding Cards**:
   - When a player discards a card, it is placed face-up in the discard pile.
   - **Blocking Mechanism**:
     - A discarded number is **blocked** for the opponent.
     - The opponent cannot place a blocked number into their stack for the remainder of the game.
     - A player may still draw and discard a blocked number, but cannot place it.

4. **Depleted Deck**:
   - If the deck runs out of cards before a player completes their sequence, reshuffle the discard pile (excluding blocked numbers for each player) to form a new deck.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to complete their stack with the sequence **1, 2, 3, 4, 5** in exact order wins the game.
   - If both players are unable to complete their sequences due to blocked numbers, the player with the most numbers in sequence wins.
   - In the case of a tie in the number of cards, the game continues until the tie is broken by further draws or one player concedes.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: Successfully build the full ascending sequence from **1** to **5**.
- **Tracking Progress**:
  - Monitor the cards in each player's stack.
  - Keep note of blocked numbers for each player.
- **Determining the Winner**:
  - The player who first completes their sequence wins immediately.
  - If completion is impossible, the player with the longer sequence (more cards) is declared the winner.

### Game Conclusion

## Strategy Tips

- **Block Wisely**: Discarding a card not only removes it from play but also blocks your opponent from using that number. Use this to prevent them from completing their sequence.
- **Anticipate Opponent's Needs**: Keep track of which numbers your opponent needs next and discard those numbers when possible.
- **Manage Redundancy**: Since there are two of each number, blocking both copies can ensure your opponent cannot proceed.
- **Balance**: Weigh the benefits of advancing your own sequence against hindering your opponent.
