# Blockade Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach your opponent's base by strategically moving your token along a linear number line while blocking your opponent's progress.

## Setup

- **Number Line**: A linear sequence of positions numbered from **0** to **10**.
- **Player Bases**:
  - **Player 1's Base**: Position **0**.
  - **Player 2's Base**: Position **10**.
- **Starting Positions**:
  - Both players' tokens start at the central position **5**.

## Game Components

- **Tokens**: Each player has a unique token representing their position on the number line.
  - Tokens cannot occupy the same position simultaneously.
- **Number Line Positions**: Numerical markers from **0** to **10** indicating possible token locations.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately, with **Player 1** starting the game.
- **Actions per Turn**:
  - Move your token **1** or **2** steps toward your opponent's base.
  - You cannot skip a turn unless no legal moves are available.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement

- **Direction**:
  - **Player 1** moves **forward** toward position **10**.
  - **Player 2** moves **backward** toward position **0**.
- **Step Options**: On your turn, you must move your token either **1** or **2** positions closer to your opponent's base.
- **Occupancy Restriction**: Tokens cannot occupy the same position:
  - You cannot move to a position already occupied by your opponent's token.
  - If both possible moves would land on the opponent's position or exceed the number line limits, you forfeit your turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to reach the opponent's base position (**0** for Player 2, **10** for Player 1) **wins the game**.
- **Forfeiting Turns**: If a player cannot make a legal move, they forfeit their turn, and the opponent continues.
- **No Draws**: The game continues until one player reaches the opponent's base.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: Successfully moving your token to your opponent's base earns you the victory.
- **Skill Advantage**: Strategic movement and blocking can consistently lead a skilled player to win.
