The action space indices in the game map directly to the possible divisors a player can choose during their turn. Each index represents a potential divisor, ranging from 0 to the maximum value `MAX_N`. However, only indices greater than 1 and less than the current value of `N` are considered valid moves if they divide `N` without a remainder and have not been used before. Hence, choosing an index corresponds to selecting that number as a divisor, where the chosen integer value at the index is subtracted from `N` to produce a new value for `N`, guiding game progression and strategy.
