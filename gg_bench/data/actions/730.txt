The action space in the game consists of integers ranging from 0 to MAX_N inclusive, representing potential divisors to select during a turn. However, only indices representing valid proper divisors of the current number \( N \) are usable on any given turn. Thus, the valid moves are defined as those indices (within the action space) which correspond to integers greater than 1 and less than \( N \) that divide \( N \) exactly. The gym environment maps these actions to moves by checking if the chosen action corresponds to a valid proper divisor in the `valid_moves` method.
