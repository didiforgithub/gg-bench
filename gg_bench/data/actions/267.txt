In the gym environment for the game "Prime Division," the action space is defined by a discrete space where each index corresponds to a permitted prime number for division. Specifically:

- Action index `0` corresponds to the prime `2`.
- Action index `1` corresponds to the prime `3`.
- Action index `2` corresponds to the prime `5`.
- Action index `3` corresponds to the prime `7`.

Players select an action by providing an index, and the environment interprets that index to determine which prime number to use for division of the current number `N`.
