In the custom gym environment, the action space is represented as a discrete space with 26 possible actions, each corresponding to one letter of the English alphabet. The indices 0 through 25 in the action space map directly to the letters A through Z. When a player selects an action, the environment uses that index to determine which letter to claim from the alphabet pool. For example, an action of 0 corresponds to claiming the letter 'A', an action of 1 corresponds to claiming the letter 'B', and so on, up to an action of 25 corresponding to claiming the letter 'Z'.
