In the provided gym environment code for the game "Odd or Even Chase," the action space is defined using `spaces.Discrete(12)`, which means there are 12 discrete actions corresponding to the indices 0 through 11. Each index represents a choice of a number on the number line from 1 to 12. Specifically, action index `i` maps to choosing the number `i + 1` (since indices are zero-based but the numbers start from 1). Therefore, action index 0 maps to selecting number 1, action index 1 maps to number 2, and so on, up to action index 11 mapping to number 12.
