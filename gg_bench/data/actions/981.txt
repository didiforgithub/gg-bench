In the gym environment for the game **Equation Conquest**, the action space indices 0 to 8 map directly to the selection of numbers 1 to 9. This means that when an action is taken, the index (`0` to `8`) is incremented by 1, resulting in the player choosing the corresponding number (`1` to `9`) to append to the sequence. This mapping allows for a straightforward representation of the player's choice within the action space, where each action corresponds uniquely to a potential number selection available in the game.
