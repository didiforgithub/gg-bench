The action space indices in the gym environment correspond to numbers in the game as follows: each index from 0 to 9 maps to a move involving choosing an integer from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Specifically, action space index 0 corresponds to the number 1, index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on, up to index 9, which corresponds to the number 10. This mapping allows for selecting any valid integer within the game's set of possible moves through the gym environment's action space.
