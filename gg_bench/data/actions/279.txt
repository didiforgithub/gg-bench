In the game environment, the action space is represented as a discrete space with three actions, corresponding to moving by 1, 2, or 3 positions along the path. These actions are indexed as follows:

- Action index `0` maps to moving forward by `1` position.
- Action index `1` maps to moving forward by `2` positions.
- Action index `2` maps to moving forward by `3` positions.

Each action index directly corresponds to the move distance, incremented by 1 from the index value to ensure a minimum move of 1 position.
