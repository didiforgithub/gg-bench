# Prime Division Duel

## Objective

Be the player to reduce the **Current Number** to exactly **1** by strategically subtracting or dividing, according to the game rules.

---

## Setup

1. **Choose the Starting Number**:
   - Players agree on a positive integer to start the game, referred to as the **Current Number**.
   - For a quick game, choose a number between **10** and **100** (e.g., **30**).

2. **Determine Turn Order**:
   - Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin).

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A positive integer that players will manipulate during the game.

- **Operations**:
  - **Subtract 1**: Decrease the Current Number by **1**.
  - **Divide by a Prime Factor**: Divide the Current Number by any of its prime factors greater than **1**, resulting in a whole number.

---

## Turns

- Players take **turns** performing **one operation** on the Current Number.
- On each turn, a player must choose one of the two operations:
  1. **Subtract 1** from the Current Number.
  2. **Divide** the Current Number by one of its **prime factors** greater than **1**.

- After the operation, the **Current Number** is updated for the next player's turn.
- **Turns alternate** between the two players until the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Operations**:
   - **Subtract 1**:
     - Always allowed as long as the Current Number is greater than **1**.
   - **Divide by a Prime Factor**:
     - The player may divide the Current Number by any of its prime factors greater than **1**.
     - The division must result in a whole number (no fractions or decimals).

2. **Prime Factors**:
   - A prime factor is a prime number that divides the Current Number without leaving a remainder.
   - Example:
     - If the Current Number is **30**, its prime factors are **2**, **3**, and **5**.
     - The player may choose to divide by **2**, **3**, or **5**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces the Current Number to exactly **1** on their turn **wins the game**.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot perform any valid operation (e.g., Current Number is **1**), they **lose their turn**, and the opponent wins by default.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players **must perform a valid operation** on their turn if possible.

---

## Scoring

- The game is **won** by the player who reduces the Current Number to **1**.
- No points are tracked beyond determining the winner of each game.
- For match play, players can keep track of the number of games won.

## Command-Line Interaction Sample

*Assuming the starting Current Number is **21**.*

```
Game Start! Current Number is 21.

Player 1's turn.
Available operations:
1. Subtract 1 (Result: 20)
2. Divide by 3 (Result: 7)
7 is prime, so the division is valid.
Choose your operation (1 or 2): 2
Player 1 divides by 3.
New Current Number is 7.

Player 2's turn.
Available operations:
1. Subtract 1 (Result: 6)
2. Divide by 7 (Result: 1)
Choose your operation (1 or 2): 2
Player 2 divides by 7.
New Current Number is 1.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Anticipate the opponent's possible moves based on the Current Number.
  - Think several moves ahead to force the opponent into a losing position.

- **Prime Awareness**:
  - Be aware of the prime factors of the Current Number.
  - Using division can drastically reduce the Current Number and limit the opponent's options.

- **Force Moves**:
  - Try to leave the opponent with a Current Number that has limited or undesirable operations.
  - For example, leaving a prime number can limit their options to subtracting or dividing by itself.
