In the `CustomEnv` environment, the action space consists of indices from 0 to 19, representing the numbers 1 to 20 in the game. An action chosen by the player corresponds to selecting the number that is one greater than the action index. For example, an action with index 0 selects the number 1, an index 1 selects number 2, and so forth up to an index 19 selecting number 20.
