# GridLock

## Objective

**GridLock** is a strategic two-player game played on a grid. The primary goal is to be the **last player able to place a token on the grid according to the placement rules**. The player who makes the last valid move wins the game, while the other player loses.

## Setup

- **Grid**: The game is played on a **5x5 grid**.
- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** uses tokens represented by `'X'`.
  - **Player 2** uses tokens represented by `'O'`.
- **Starting Conditions**: All cells in the grid are initially empty. Player 1 takes the first turn.

## Game Components

### Grid

- A 5x5 grid represented as a matrix of cells.
- Each cell can be in one of three states:
  - **Empty**: Represented by an underscore (`'_'`).
  - **Occupied by Player 1**: Contains an `'X'`.
  - **Occupied by Player 2**: Contains an `'O'`.

### Tokens

- **Player Tokens**:
  - Player 1 has an unlimited supply of `'X'` tokens.
  - Player 2 has an unlimited supply of `'O'` tokens.
- **Functionality**:
  - Tokens are placed on the grid during a player's turn.
  - Tokens remain on the grid once placed and cannot be moved or removed.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
2. **Action**: On their turn, a player places one of their tokens on an empty cell, following the placement rules.
3. **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until neither player can make a valid move.

### Player Actions

- **Place a Token**: Place your token on an empty cell that adheres to the placement rules.
- **Pass**: If no valid moves are available, the player passes their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Placement Rules

- **Non-Adjacency Rule**: You cannot place your token on a cell that is adjacent (including diagonally) to any of your own tokens already on the grid.
  - **Adjacent Cells**: Any cell that is directly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal to a given cell.
- **Opponent Tokens**: You may place your token adjacent to your opponent's tokens without restriction.
- **Valid Moves**: If at least one valid cell is available, you must make a move.
- **Passing**: If no valid moves are available, you must pass your turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The game ends when both players have no valid moves remaining. The player who made the **last valid move** wins the game.
- **Loss Condition**: If you cannot make a valid move and your opponent made the last valid move, you lose the game.

## Scoring

- **No Points System**: There is no scoring or points system in GridLock.
- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game outcome is simply a win for one player and a loss for the other based on the ability to make the last valid move.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Grid

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
```

#### Turn 1: Player 1 (X)

- **Action**: Places `'X'` at **row 3, column 3**.
- **Grid**:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ X _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
```

#### Turn 2: Player 2 (O)

- **Action**: Places `'O'` at **row 2, column 2**.
- **Grid**:

```
_ _ _ _ _
_ O _ _ _
_ _ X _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
```

#### Turn 3: Player 1 (X)

- **Invalid Positions**: Cannot place next to their own `'X'` at (3,3). Adjacent cells are:

  ```
  (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)
  (3,2),       (3,4)
  (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)
  ```
- **Action**: Places `'X'` at **row 1, column 5**.
- **Grid**:

```
_ _ _ _ X
_ O _ _ _
_ _ X _ _
_ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _
```

#### Turn 4: Player 2 (O)

- **Invalid Positions**: Cannot place next to their own `'O'` at (2,2). Adjacent cells are:

  ```
  (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
  (2,1),       (2,3)
  (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
  ```
- **Action**: Places `'O'` at **row 5, column 1**.
- **Grid**:

```
_ _ _ _ X
_ O _ _ _
_ _ X _ _
_ _ _ _ _
O _ _ _ _
```

#### Continuing the Game

Players continue to alternate turns, placing their tokens on valid positions until one or both players cannot make a valid move.

### Endgame Scenario

#### Grid Before Player 1's Turn

```
X _ _ _ X
_ O _ _ _
_ _ X _ _
_ _ _ _ _
O _ _ _ O
```

#### Player 1 (X)

- **Invalid Positions**: All remaining empty cells are adjacent to Player 1's tokens.
- **Action**: Cannot make a valid move and must **pass**.

#### Player 2 (O)

- **Valid Positions**: Checks for any valid moves.
- **Action**: If able to place an `'O'`, does so. If not, must pass.

#### Determining the Winner

- **Last Player to Make a Valid Move**: If Player 2 was the last to place a token, **Player 2 wins**.
- **Outcome**: Player 1 loses, and Player 2 wins the game.

  - Blocking opponent's options while maximizing your own is key.
  - Anticipate future moves based on the current state of the grid.
- **Gameplay Tips**:
  - Try to spread your tokens out to have more placement options.
  - Consider forcing your opponent into positions where they have limited moves.
