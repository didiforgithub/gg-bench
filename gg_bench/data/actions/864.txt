In the game, the action space indices (0 to 8) map directly to the 3x3 grid cell coordinates as follows:
- Index 0 corresponds to cell (1,1)
- Index 1 corresponds to cell (1,2)
- Index 2 corresponds to cell (1,3)
- Index 3 corresponds to cell (2,1)
- Index 4 corresponds to cell (2,2)
- Index 5 corresponds to cell (2,3)
- Index 6 corresponds to cell (3,1)
- Index 7 corresponds to cell (3,2)
- Index 8 corresponds to cell (3,3)

Each index represents the respective coordinate for an attack on the opponent's grid.
