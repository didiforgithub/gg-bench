In the game environment, each action space index corresponds to a unique perfect square that a player can choose to subtract from the current value of N. Specifically, the action space is a discrete space with 10 possible actions (indices 0-9), each representing one of the perfect squares up to 100. The mapping is as follows: index 0 maps to the perfect square 1, index 1 to 4, index 2 to 9, index 3 to 16, index 4 to 25, index 5 to 36, index 6 to 49, index 7 to 64, index 8 to 81, and index 9 to 100. When a player selects an action index, they are choosing the corresponding perfect square to subtract from N during their turn.
