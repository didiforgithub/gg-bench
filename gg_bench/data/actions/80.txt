In this gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.N_max + 1)`, which means actions are represented as integers from 0 up to and including N_max (initially set to 30). Each action corresponds to a divisor D that a player can choose to subtract from the current number N. The mapping between action space indices and the game moves is straightforward: an action index directly represents a potential divisor D for the current N. Valid moves are when D > 1, D < N, and N % D == 0. Thus, actions within the range fulfilling these conditions correspond to the legal moves a player can make. Invalid actions (non-divisors or out of range) result in penalties or an end to the game.
