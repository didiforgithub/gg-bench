In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space indices correspond to selecting numbers from the shared pool, which contain the numbers 2 through 9. Specifically, the indices map to actions as follows:

- `Action 0`: Select number 2
- `Action 1`: Select number 3
- `Action 2`: Select number 4
- `Action 3`: Select number 5
- `Action 4`: Select number 6
- `Action 5`: Select number 7
- `Action 6`: Select number 8
- `Action 7`: Select number 9

Each index corresponds to adding 2 to the index value to identify the number to be selected from the pool.
