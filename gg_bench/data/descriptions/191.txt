# Prime Rumble: Rule Book

## Objective

Prime Rumble is a two-player strategic game where players take turns selecting numbers from a shared pool. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn. You achieve victory by strategically removing numbers and their multiples from the pool, leaving your opponent with no options.

## Setup

1. **Game Pool**: The game starts with a shared pool of consecutive integers from **2** to **50**.
2. **Player Roles**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a simple random method like a coin toss.
3. **Initial Conditions**: Both players begin with no prior advantages or disadvantages.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list of integers ranging from **2** to **50**.
  - Appearance: Displayed as a list or array of numbers in the command-line interface.
  - Functionality: Numbers are selected and removed based on the game rules.
- **Player Turn Indicator**: A prompt indicating which player's turn it is.
- **Command-Line Inputs**: Players input their chosen numbers via the command line.
- **Game State Display**: After each turn, the updated number pool is displayed.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Player Actions**:
  - **Select a Number**: On your turn, choose any remaining number from the number pool.
  - **System Updates**: The chosen number and all its multiples are removed from the pool.
- **Turn Progression**:
  1. **Prompt**: The system prompts the current player for their move.
  2. **Input**: The player inputs their chosen number.
  3. **Validation**: The system checks if the number is valid (i.e., it is in the current pool).
  4. **Removal**: The system removes the chosen number and its multiples.
  5. **Display**: The updated number pool is displayed.
  6. **Switch Turns**: The next player's turn begins.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Choices**:
   - On your turn, you must select a number that is currently available in the number pool.
   - **Invalid Move**: If you attempt to select a number not in the pool, you will be prompted to choose again.

2. **Number Removal**:
   - When a number is selected, the system removes **that number** and **all multiples** of that number from the pool.
   - Example: If you select **3**, the system removes **3, 6, 9, 12**, etc., up to **50**.

3. **Victory Condition**:
   - **Winning the Game**: You win if your opponent has no valid moves on their turn because the pool is empty.
   - The game cannot end in a draw.

4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move.
   - The player who made the last valid move is declared the winner.

5. **Strategic Notes**:
   - **Planning Ahead**: Think about which numbers you remove to limit your opponent's options.
   - **Prime Numbers**: Selecting prime numbers can be a powerful strategy as they remove more numbers from the pool.
   - **Avoiding Traps**: Be cautious not to leave the pool in a state where you have no valid moves on your next turn.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Tracking**: Keep track of wins and losses if playing multiple rounds.
- **Points**: You can assign points for each win to create a match (e.g., best of five games).
- **No Ongoing Scores**: There are no points scored during a single game; the focus is on winning the game itself.

## Additional Rules Clarifications

- **Multiples Beyond 50**: Only consider multiples of the chosen number within the initial pool range (2 to 50).
- **Single Number Removal**: If the chosen number has no multiples within the pool (e.g., when selecting large prime numbers late in the game), only the chosen number is removed.
- **Invalid Input Handling**:
  - If a player inputs an invalid number (e.g., not in the pool or out of range), prompt them again.
  - The turn is not forfeited on invalid input unless a player repeatedly attempts invalid moves intentionally.

## Strategy Tips

- **Early Game**:
  - Target numbers with many multiples to reduce the pool quickly.
  - Removing small prime numbers like **2** and **3** eliminates many options for your opponent.

- **Mid to Late Game**:
  - Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the remaining numbers.
  - Try to force a situation where no matter what choices are left, you will have the last valid move.

- **Counting Ahead**:
  - Keep track of the numbers removed to predict future available moves.
  - Consider the order of number removal to control the flow of the game.

Prime Rumble is a game of strategy and foresight. By carefully selecting numbers and considering the impact on the number pool, you can outmaneuver your opponent. With simple rules and deep strategic potential, Prime Rumble offers an engaging experience that tests your numerical prowess in a quick and decisive battle.
