# Energy Duel

**Objective**

Energy Duel is a strategic two-player turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's Energy Points (EP) to zero before they do the same to you. Players achieve victory by strategically choosing actions each turn to attack, defend, or recover energy. The game ends quickly, and there is always a decisive winnerâ€”no draws are possible.

---

**Setup**

- **Starting Energy**: Both players begin the game with **10 Energy Points (EP)**.
- **Player Identification**: Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
- **Action Availability**: Each player has access to the same set of actions (spells) from the start.

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Attack**
   - **Effect**: Reduces the opponent's EP by **2** points.
   - **Shield Interaction**: If the opponent has an active shield, the damage is reduced by **1** point (opponent loses only **1** EP).
   - **Shield Expiration**: If the opponent's shield absorbs damage, it expires after the attack.

2. **Heal**
   - **Effect**: Increases your own EP by **1** point.
   - **Maximum EP**: Your EP cannot exceed **10**. If at 10 EP, Heal has no effect.
   - **Shield Interaction**: Healing does not affect shields.

3. **Shield**
   - **Effect**: Grants a shield that reduces damage from the opponent's next attack by **1** point.
   - **Duration**: The shield remains active until the start of your next turn or until it absorbs damage.
   - **Multiple Shields**: Shields do not stack. Casting Shield while a shield is already active refreshes its duration but does not increase its effect.

4. **Energy Point Limits**
   - **Minimum EP**: EP cannot drop below **0**.
   - **Maximum EP**: EP cannot exceed **10**.

5. **Winning the Game**
   - A player wins immediately when their opponent's EP reaches **0**.

6. **No Draws**
   - Since actions are resolved immediately and EP cannot drop below zero, it's impossible for both players to reach 0 EP on the same turn.

**Scoring**

- **Victory**: The winning player may keep track of wins if playing multiple rounds.
- **No Point System**: There is no point accumulation beyond tracking wins for consecutive games.

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Try to predict if your opponent will shield or heal and adjust your strategy accordingly.
- **Shield Timing**: Use shields when you suspect an incoming attack to maximize their effectiveness.
