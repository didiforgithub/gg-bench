**Game Name: Equation Duel**

---

### **Objective**

Equation Duel is a two-player turn-based game where players compete to create valid mathematical equations using numbers from a shared pool. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot create a valid equation on their turn. The last player to successfully form a valid equation wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool**:
   - The game uses a shared pool of numbers consisting of digits from **1 to 9**, with **each number appearing twice**, resulting in a total of **18 numbers**.
   - The initial number pool is displayed to both players at the start:
     ```
     Number Pool: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]
     ```

2. **Determine Player Order**:
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done by mutual agreement or by any random method.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**:
  - Shared between both players.
  - Contains numbers **1** through **9**, each appearing **twice**.
  
- **Operators**:
  - Allowed operators are **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **division (/)**.

- **Equation Format**:
  - Equations must be in the format **A op B = C**, where:
    - **A**, **B**, and **C** are numbers taken from the number pool.
    - **op** is one of the allowed operators.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.
   - On a player's turn, they attempt to create a valid equation using numbers from the number pool.

2. **Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Select Three Numbers** from the current number pool.
   - Choose an **Operator** to use between the numbers.
   - Form a **Valid Equation** in the format **A op B = C**.

3. **Post-Turn Updates**:
   - If the equation is valid, **remove the three used numbers** from the number pool.
   - Update the number pool display for both players.

4. **Turn Progression**:
   - The game proceeds to the other player after each turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Equation Formation Rules**:
   - **All three numbers** must be available in the current number pool.
   - The equation must be **mathematically correct**.
   - **Operators**:
     - **Addition (+)**: \( A + B = C \)
     - **Subtraction (-)**: \( A - B = C \)
     - **Multiplication (*)**: \( A \times B = C \)
     - **Division (/)**:
       - **Division by zero is not allowed**.
       - The result must be an **integer** (no fractions or decimals).

2. **Number Usage**:
   - Each number used in an equation is **removed** from the pool after a valid equation.
   - **Numbers cannot be reused** once removed.

3. **Invalid Equations**:
   - If a player proposes an **invalid equation** (incorrect math or using unavailable numbers), they **lose the game**.

4. **Ending the Game**:
   - A player **loses** if they **cannot form a valid equation** on their turn.
   - The last player who successfully created a valid equation is declared the **winner**.

---

### **Scoring**

- There is **no point system**; the game is **win or lose**.
- The **winner** is the player who forces their opponent into a position where no valid equations can be formed.

### **Examples**

#### **Initial Number Pool**

```
Number Pool: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]
```

#### **Sample Turn Sequence**

1. **Turn 1 (Player 1)**:
   - **Action**: Selects **2**, **3**, **5**.
   - **Equation**: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \)
   - **Result**: Valid.
   - **Updated Number Pool**:
     ```
     Number Pool: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]
     ```

2. **Turn 2 (Player 2)**:
   - **Action**: Selects **8**, **2**, **6**.
   - **Equation**: \( 8 - 2 = 6 \)
   - **Result**: Valid.
   - **Updated Number Pool**:
     ```
     Number Pool: [1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9]
     ```

3. **Turn 3 (Player 1)**:
   - **Action**: Selects **4**, **5**, **9**.
   - **Equation**: \( 4 + 5 = 9 \)
   - **Result**: Valid.
   - **Updated Number Pool**:
     ```
     Number Pool: [1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9]
     ```

4. **Turn 4 (Player 2)**:
   - **Action**: Selects **7**, **1**, **8**.
   - **Equation**: \( 8 - 1 = 7 \)
   - **Result**: Valid.
   - **Updated Number Pool**:
     ```
     Number Pool: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9]
     ```

5. **Turn 5 (Player 1)**:
   - **Action**: Selects **1**, **6**, **7**.
   - **Equation**: \( 6 + 1 = 7 \)
   - **Result**: Valid.
   - **Updated Number Pool**:
     ```
     Number Pool: [3, 4, 9]
     ```

6. **Turn 6 (Player 2)**:
   - **Action**: Attempts to form an equation but cannot.
   - **Result**: Player 2 loses.
   - **Winner**: Player 1.

### **Command-Line Interaction Examples**

#### **Start of Turn**

```
[Game State]
Current Number Pool: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

[Player 1's Turn]
Enter your equation (format: A op B = C):
```

#### **Player Input**

```
6 + 1 = 7
```

#### **Game Response**

```
Valid equation! Numbers 1, 6, and 7 have been removed from the pool.
```

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**:
  - Keep track of which numbers remain to anticipate future equations.
- **Limit Opponent's Options**:
  - Use numbers that, if left, could help your opponent.
- **Use High-Value Numbers Wisely**:
  - Numbers like **9** and **8** are versatile; using them effectively can be advantageous.

---

### **Conclusion**

Equation Duel is a game of arithmetic skill and strategic planning. By creating valid equations and managing the shared number pool effectively, players can outmaneuver their opponent and secure victory.

---

Remember, the key to winning is not just forming valid equations but also thinking ahead to limit your opponent's possibilities. Enjoy the challenge of Equation Duel!
