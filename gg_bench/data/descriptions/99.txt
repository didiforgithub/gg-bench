# Number Tower

## Objective

**Number Tower** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the last one able to place a number on a shared tower without violating the ascending order rule. The primary goal is to outmaneuver your opponent by carefully selecting numbers to limit their available moves. A player wins by either placing the last valid number on the tower or by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a legal move.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool**: A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **30** is available for both players. Each number can only be used once during the game.
2. **The Tower**: The game begins with an empty tower where numbers will be stacked in ascending order according to the game rules.
3. **Player Roles**: Decide which player will go first. Players can flip a coin or agree among themselves.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool (1-30)**: The set of numbers available for selection. Each number has the following attributes:
  - **Value**: An integer from 1 to 30.
  - **Availability**: Once a number is placed on the tower, it is no longer available for selection.

- **The Tower**: Represents the stack of numbers placed by the players during the game.
  - **Current Top Number**: The number at the top of the tower, which dictates the allowable range for the next move.

## Turns

Players alternate turns throughout the game. Each turn consists of the following steps:

1. **Determine Allowable Range**:
   - If the tower is empty, any number from **1** to **30** can be played.
   - If the tower has numbers, calculate the allowable range for the next number:
     - The next number must be **greater than** the current top number.
     - The next number must **not exceed** the current top number by more than **5**.

2. **Select a Number**:
   - Choose an available number from the number pool that fits within the allowable range.
   - Remove the selected number from the number pool.

3. **Place the Number on the Tower**:
   - Add the selected number to the top of the tower.

4. **End Turn**:
   - Pass the turn to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Ascending Order Rule**: Each new number placed on the tower must satisfy:
  - **Greater Than**: It must be greater than the number immediately below it on the tower.
  - **Within Limit**: It must not be greater than the number below plus **5**.

- **Number Availability**:
  - Numbers from **1** to **30** are available at the game's start.
  - Each number can only be used **once**. Once placed on the tower, it cannot be selected again.

- **Legal Moves**:
  - A move is legal if there is at least one available number that fits within the allowable range.
  - If a player has no legal moves on their turn, they **lose** the game.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins by:
    - Placing the last possible valid number on the tower.
    - Forcing their opponent into a position where no legal moves are available on their turn.

## Scoring

No points are tracked in **Number Tower**. The game is won by meeting the winning conditions outlined above. However, players may keep track of wins over multiple games to determine overall performance or skill levels.
