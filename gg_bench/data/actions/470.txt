In the game, each action space index (0 to 24) corresponds to a unique combination of bids for both players. The action is divided into two bids using division and modulus operations:

- **Player 1's bid** is determined by integer division of the action index by 5, then adding 1. This results in a bid from 1 to 5 (e.g., action 0 to 4 gives Player 1's bid as 1, action 5 to 9 gives bid as 2, and so on).

- **Player 2's bid** is determined by the remainder of the action index when divided by 5, then adding 1. This also results in a bid from 1 to 5 (e.g., action 0, 5, 10, etc., gives Player 2's bid as 1, action 1, 6, 11, etc., gives bid as 2, and so on).

Thus, each combination of bids (1 to 5 for both players) is uniquely represented by a single action space index.
