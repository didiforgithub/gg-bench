In the gym environment, each index in the action space (0 to 100) represents a potential divisor that a player might choose. However, only indices that correspond to the proper divisors of the current Shared Number are valid moves. For example, if the current Shared Number is 30, valid action indices would correspond to the proper divisors of 30 (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15). The environment checks the validity of the selected action against these proper divisors during each step.
