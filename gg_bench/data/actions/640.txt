In the given gym environment for the "Number Bridge" game, the action space indices are mapped to the moves as follows:

- **Indices 0 to 19:** Correspond to selecting numbers 1 to 20 from the shared pool. For example, index 0 represents selecting the number 1, index 1 represents selecting the number 2, and so on up to index 19 for the number 20.
- **Index 20:** Represents the "pass" action, where the player opts not to select a number, either because no valid moves are available or as a strategic decision when they have no legal selections remaining without exceeding the sum of 30.
