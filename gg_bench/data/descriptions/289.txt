## Objective

The primary goal of Factor Duel is to be the player who reduces the shared number, **N**, to exactly **1** by strategically dividing it by its prime factors. The player who successfully accomplishes this feat wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number (N):**
   - Agree on a starting number **N** with your opponent. This number should be a positive integer greater than 1. For a quick game, you might start with a smaller number like **30**; for a longer, more challenging game, you might choose a larger number like **210**.
   
2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide who will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement, a coin toss, or any random method of your choice.

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Both players start with no pieces or physical tokens. All gameplay is conducted through manipulating the shared number **N** according to the rules.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):**
  - The central element of the game. Both players will manipulate this number during their turns.
  - **N** changes throughout the game as players divide it by prime factors.

- **Prime Factors:**
  - The prime numbers that exactly divide **N** without leaving a remainder.
  - Players use these prime factors to reduce **N** on their turns.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
  - The game is played in a command-line environment where players input their moves and receive updates.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Identify Valid Prime Factors:**
   - At the beginning of your turn, determine all prime numbers that are factors of the current **N**.

2. **Choose a Prime Factor:**
   - Select one prime factor from the list of valid options.

3. **Divide N:**
   - Divide **N** by the chosen prime factor.
   - The result must be an integer (no fractions or decimals).

4. **Update N:**
   - The new value of **N** becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

5. **Announce Move:**
   - In the CLI, input your chosen prime factor.
   - The system will display the updated value of **N**.

### Example Turn

- **Current N:** 60
- **Valid Prime Factors:** 2, 3, 5
- **Player's Choice:** 3
- **Calculation:** 60 ÷ 3 = 20
- **Updated N:** 20
- **CLI Input:** `Divide by 3`
- **CLI Output:** `N is now 20`

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must divide **N** by a prime factor of **N**.
   - The prime factor must be a prime number greater than 1 (since 1 is not a prime number).

2. **Updating N:**
   - After division, **N** is updated to the new value.
   - The updated **N** is used by the next player on their turn.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If you reduce **N** to exactly **1** on your turn, you win the game.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - If you cannot make a valid move because **N** has no prime factors (e.g., **N** is 1), you lose the game.

5. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw; a winner will always be determined.

### Additional Rules

- **Invalid Moves:**
  - If you attempt to divide **N** by a number that is not a valid prime factor of **N**, it is considered an invalid move.
  - The system will prompt you to choose again.

- **Time Limits:**
   - To keep the game flowing, you may set a time limit per move (e.g., 30 seconds). This is optional but recommended.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The first player to reduce **N** to exactly **1** wins the game.
  - No points are tallied; victory is determined solely by achieving the objective.

- **Losing the Game:**
  - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn, you lose, and your opponent wins.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Starting N:** 30

**Prime Factors of 30:** 2, 3, 5

**Turn Sequence:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses prime factor **5**.
   - **Calculation:** 30 ÷ 5 = 6
   - **Updated N:** 6
   - **CLI Input:** `Divide by 5`
   - **CLI Output:** `N is now 6`

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses prime factor **2**.
   - **Calculation:** 6 ÷ 2 = 3
   - **Updated N:** 3
   - **CLI Input:** `Divide by 2`
   - **CLI Output:** `N is now 3`

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses prime factor **3**.
   - **Calculation:** 3 ÷ 3 = 1
   - **Updated N:** 1
   - **CLI Input:** `Divide by 3`
   - **CLI Output:** `N is now 1. Player 1 wins!`

### Example Game 2

**Starting N:** 105

**Prime Factors of 105:** 3, 5, 7

**Turn Sequence:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses prime factor **7**.
   - **Calculation:** 105 ÷ 7 = 15
   - **Updated N:** 15
   - **CLI Input:** `Divide by 7`
   - **CLI Output:** `N is now 15`

2. **Player 2's Turn:**

## Strategies

### Plan Ahead

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves:**
  - Consider how your move will affect the available options for your opponent.
  - Try to leave **N** in a state where your opponent has fewer favorable moves.

- **Prime Factorization:**
  - Quickly factorize **N** at the start of your turn to know all your options.

### Control the Game

- **Dominant Prime Factors:**
  - Use larger prime factors when advantageous to reduce **N** more significantly.
  - Save certain prime factors for strategic moments.

- **Force Errors:**
  - Aim to push your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** What if a player tries to divide **N** by a number that is not a prime factor?

**A:** The move is invalid. The player will be prompted to choose a valid prime factor of **N**.

**Q:** Can we start with any number?

**A:** Yes, as long as **N** is a positive integer greater than 1. Starting with a larger **N** will generally result in a longer game.

**Q:** What happens if **N** becomes a prime number?

**A:** If **N** is prime, the only valid move is to divide **N** by itself, leading to **N** becoming **1**. The player making this move wins the game.
