The action space in the gym environment is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing the numbers 1 through 9 that a player can select during their turn. The mapping between action space indices and the game moves is as follows:

- Action `0` corresponds to the number `1`
- Action `1` corresponds to the number `2`
- Action `2` corresponds to the number `3`
- Action `3` corresponds to the number `4`
- Action `4` corresponds to the number `5`
- Action `5` corresponds to the number `6`
- Action `6` corresponds to the number `7`
- Action `7` corresponds to the number `8`
- Action `8` corresponds to the number `9`

This mapping means that the integer selected from the discrete action space is increased by one to represent the actual number the player will place in the sequence.
