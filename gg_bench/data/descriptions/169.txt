# Number Knockout Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Knockout** is a strategic two-player turn-based game. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move by strategically selecting numbers from a shared list. Force your opponent into a position where they cannot select a valid number on their turn, thereby winning the game.

## Setup

1. **Game Start:**
   - The game uses a shared list of numbers from **1** to **20**.
   - All numbers are initially **unmarked** and available for selection.
   - Players decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2** (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

2. **Player Identification:**
   - **Player 1**: The player who makes the first move.
   - **Player 2**: The opponent who moves second.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number List:**
  - A list containing integers from **1** to **20**, displayed in the command-line interface.
  - Numbers are either **available** (unmarked) or **selected** (marked).
  
- **Players:**
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2**, who take turns selecting numbers.

- **Marking Mechanism:**
  - When a number is selected, it is marked and removed from the pool of available numbers.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
  - Each turn consists of:
    1. **Input Phase**: The player inputs their chosen number.
    2. **Validation Phase**: The game checks if the move is valid based on the rules.
    3. **Update Phase**: If valid, the number is marked as selected.

- **Player Actions:**
  - On their turn, a player must select an available number following the game's rules.
  - If unable to make a valid move, the player loses, and the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. First Move

- **Player 1** can select **any one number** from the available numbers on their first turn.

### 2. Subsequent Moves

- On each turn after the first:
  - A player must select an **available number** that is a **divisor** or a **multiple** of the number selected by their opponent in the previous turn.
  
- **Divisors and Multiples:**
  - **Divisor**: A number that divides another number without leaving a remainder.
  - **Multiple**: A number that is the product of another number and an integer.

### 3. Valid Moves

- A move is **valid** if:
  - The selected number is **available** (has not been previously selected).
  - It is a **divisor** or **multiple** of the opponent's last selected number.
  
- **Invalid Moves:**
  - Selecting a number that is not a divisor or multiple of the opponent's last number.
  - Selecting a number that has already been selected.

### 4. Winning the Game

- A player **wins** if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- The game ends immediately when a player cannot select a valid number.

### 5. No Draws

- There is **no draw mechanism** in Number Knockout.
- The game continues until one player wins according to the rules.

## Scoring

- There is **no point-scoring system** in Number Knockout.
- Victory is determined solely by forcing the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.
