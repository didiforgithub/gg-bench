In the `Sum Trap` game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete set of 10 indices, ranging from 0 to 9. Each action index corresponds to a move in the game, where the index `i` represents selecting the number `i + 1`. For instance, choosing action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 9, which corresponds to selecting the number 10. This mapping provides a direct way to select numbers between 1 and 10 using the action space indices.
