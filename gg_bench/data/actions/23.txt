In the action space of the `CustomEnv` gym environment, each index from 0 to 19 corresponds directly to selecting numbers 1 through 20 in the game. For example, an action index of 0 corresponds to choosing the number 1, an index of 1 corresponds to choosing the number 2, and so on, up to an index of 19 which corresponds to choosing the number 20. This mapping is based on zero-based indexing where the action index plus one gives the actual number selected from the Number Pool.
