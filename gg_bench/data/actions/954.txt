In the game environment, the action space indices (0 through 8) correspond to the selection of numbers 1 through 9 from the shared pool. Specifically, an action index of `k` represents the selection of the number `k+1`. Each index directly maps to its respective number because the action space is designed to be zero-indexed, while the numbers in the pool are one-indexed. This straightforward mapping allows players to select numbers efficiently by referencing the appropriate action index.
