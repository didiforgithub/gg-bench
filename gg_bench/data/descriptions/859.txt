# Factor Duel

## Objective

**Factor Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where players take turns selecting numbers from a shared list. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot select a valid number according to the game rules. The player who successfully does this wins the game.

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: A shared list of integers from **2 to 50** inclusive.
- **Starting Conditions**:
  - Both players begin with no numbers selected.
  - All numbers from 2 to 50 are available for selection.
- **Player Roles**:
  - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: The central component of the game, comprising integers **2 through 50**.
  - Each number is unique and can be selected only once during the game.
- **Selected Numbers**: A record of numbers that have been picked by both players.
  - Used to determine valid selections on each turn.
- **Available Numbers**: The numbers remaining in the Number Pool after selections are made.
  - Updated after each turn.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player selects a valid number from the Available Numbers.
  2. **Validation**: The selected number must not be a multiple or a factor of any previously selected number.
  3. **Update**:
     - Remove the selected number from the Available Numbers.
     - Add the selected number to the list of Selected Numbers.
  4. **Turn Progression**: Turns alternate between players until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Selections**:
  - A number is valid if it is not a multiple or factor of any number already selected by either player.
  - **Factors**: Numbers that divide evenly into another number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
  - **Multiples**: Numbers that are evenly divisible by another number.
- **Selection Restrictions**:
  - You cannot select a number that is a **factor** of any previously selected number.
  - You cannot select a number that is a **multiple** of any previously selected number.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - If a player has no valid numbers to select on their turn, they lose the game.
  - The opponent is declared the winner.
- **Example of Factors and Multiples**:
  - If **6** is a previously selected number:
    - **Factors of 6**: 2, 3
    - **Multiples of 6**: 12, 18, 24, etc.
    - The numbers 2, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, etc., cannot be selected.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The game does not use a point-based scoring system.
  - Winning is achieved by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **Game End**:
  - The game ends immediately when a player cannot select a valid number.
  - No draws are possible in this game.

## Strategic Tips

- **Select Prime Numbers Early**: Choosing prime numbers can limit your opponent's options due to fewer factors.
- **Avoid Common Factors**: Be mindful of numbers that share common factors with previously selected numbers.
- **Force Multiples**: Try to select numbers whose multiples are abundant in the remaining pool, restricting your opponent's choices.
- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the impact of your selection on future turns, not just the immediate next move.

## Conclusion

Factor Duel is a simple yet strategic game that tests players' numerical reasoning and foresight. By carefully selecting numbers and anticipating your opponent's moves, you can gain the upper hand and secure victory.

Have fun and may the best strategist win!
