The action space indices in the game correspond to the list of predefined prime numbers (`self.primes`). Each index in the action space represents a move where the game state (shared number) is divided by the prime number at that corresponding index. For example, if the action is `0`, it refers to dividing by the first prime in the list, which is `2`. This mapping allows players to choose prime factors as valid moves based on their index in the list of prime numbers.
