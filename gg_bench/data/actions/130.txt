In the game, the action space indices map to move distances as follows:
- Action 0 corresponds to a move of 1 position.
- Action 1 corresponds to a move of 2 positions.
- Action 2 corresponds to a move of 3 positions.

This mapping allows players to choose from three possible moves on their turn by selecting the appropriate action index (0, 1, or 2).
