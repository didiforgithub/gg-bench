The action space uses integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the available moves in the game. These indices map to the multipliers as follows: index 0 maps to multiplier 2, index 1 maps to multiplier 3, and index 2 maps to multiplier 4. This mapping allows players to choose their move by selecting one of the indexed actions, which correspond to multiplying the cumulative number by 2, 3, or 4, respectively.
