# Divisor Duel

---

## Objective

Become the player who reduces the shared positive integer, known as **N**, to exactly **zero** by strategically subtracting its proper divisors. The player who successfully reduces N to zero **wins the game**. If a player cannot make a valid move (no proper divisors exist for N), that player **loses**.

---

## Setup

1. **Choose an initial number (N):**
   - Select a positive integer greater than 1 to start the game (e.g., **N = 25**).
   - This number will be shared and updated throughout the game.

2. **Determine player order:**
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Players will alternate turns starting with Player 1.

3. **Initialize the game environment:**
   - Ensure that both players can view the current value of N at all times.
   - Prepare a method (command-line input) for players to input their chosen divisors.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):**
  - A positive integer displayed and updated on each turn.
  - Represents the current state of the game.

- **Proper Divisors:**
  - Positive integers that divide N evenly, excluding N itself.
  - For example, the proper divisors of 10 are 1, 2, and 5.

---

## Turns

1. **Player's Turn Structure:**
   - **Display Current N:**
     - Announce the current value of N to both players.
   - **List Proper Divisors:**
     - Calculate and display all proper divisors of N.
   - **Select Divisor:**
     - The player selects one proper divisor to subtract from N.
   - **Update N:**
     - Subtract the chosen divisor from N.
     - Announce the new value of N.

2. **Turn Progression:**
   - Players alternate turns following the above structure.
   - The game continues until a player wins or loses according to the game rules.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On their turn, a player must subtract a proper divisor of N (excluding N itself).
   - The chosen divisor must be a positive integer that evenly divides N.
   - If N is 1, its only proper divisor is 1.

2. **Updating N:**
   - After the player subtracts the chosen divisor, N is updated to this new value.
   - The updated N becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If a player reduces N to **exactly zero** on their turn, they **win** the game.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (no proper divisors for N), they **lose** the game.
   - This situation occurs when N is greater than zero but has no proper divisors (e.g., N is 1 or a prime number with only N and 1 as divisors).

5. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw; it will always result in a win or a loss.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory:**
  - The player who reduces N to zero on their turn wins the game.
- **Defeat:**
  - The player who cannot make a valid move loses the game.
- **No Points System:**
  - The game is binary; there are only winners and losers for each round.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Setup:**

- Starting N: **25**
- Player Order:
  - Player 1: Starts first.
  - Player 2: Goes second.

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Current N:** 25
- **Proper Divisors of 25:** 1, 5
- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Chooses to subtract **5**.
- **Updated N:** 25 - 5 = **20**

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current N:** 20
- **Proper Divisors of 20:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 10
- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Chooses to subtract **10**.
- **Updated N:** 20 - 10 = **10**

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current N:** 10
- **Proper Divisors of 10:** 1, 2, 5
- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Chooses to subtract **5**.
- **Updated N:** 10 - 5 = **5**

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current N:** 5
- **Proper Divisors of 5:** 1
- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Must subtract **1** (only option).
- **Updated N:** 5 - 1 = **4**

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Current N:** 4
- **Proper Divisors of 4:** 1, 2
- **Player 1's Move:**
  - Chooses to subtract **2**.
- **Updated N:** 4 - 2 = **2**

---

**Turn 6: Player 2**

- **Current N:** 2
- **Proper Divisors of 2:** 1
- **Player 2's Move:**
  - Must subtract **1** (only option).
- **Updated N:** 2 - 1 = **1**

---

**Turn 7: Player 1**

- **Current N:** 1
- **Proper Divisors of 1:** None
- **Player 1's Situation:**
  - No valid moves available.
- **Result:**
  - **Player 1 loses.**
  - **Player 2 wins the game.**

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming the game begins with **N = 15**:

**Turn 1: Player 1**

```
Current N: 15
Proper divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5
Player 1, select a divisor to subtract: 5
N is now: 15 - 5 = 10
```

**Turn 2: Player 2**

```
Current N: 10
Proper divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5
Player 2, select a divisor to subtract: 5
N is now: 10 - 5 = 5
```

**Turn 3: Player 1**

```
Current N: 5
Proper divisors of 5: 1
Player 1, select a divisor to subtract: 1
N is now: 5 - 1 = 4
```

**Turn 4: Player 2**

```
Current N: 4
Proper divisors of 4: 1, 2
Player 2, select a divisor to subtract: 2
N is now: 4 - 2 = 2
```

**Turn 5: Player 1**

```
Current N: 2
Proper divisors of 2: 1
Player 1, select a divisor to subtract: 1
N is now: 2 - 1 = 1
```

**Turn 6: Player 2**

```
Current N: 1
Proper divisors of 1: None
Player 2 has no valid moves.
Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Consider the possible outcomes of your moves to force a win.
- **Limit Opponent's Options:**
  - Aim to leave N in a state where the opponent has only one move or no valid moves.
- **Avoid Reducing N to Prime Numbers Greater Than 1:**
  - Primes have limited proper divisors (only 1), which might force you into a disadvantage.
- **Utilize Larger Divisors Wisely:**
  - Sometimes subtracting a smaller divisor is more strategic to control the flow of the game.
