# **Mystic Numbers**

## **Objective**

Be the first player to reach the mystical number 21 exactly by strategically selecting and manipulating numbers from a shared pool. The player who achieves a total sum of exactly 21 wins the game. If a player exceeds a total sum of 21, they lose immediately. There is no draw mechanism, ensuring a decisive outcome each game. Skillful calculation and strategic planning will lead a player to victory over an unskilled opponent.

## **Setup**

1. **Number Pool Initialization**: Create a shared pool containing the numbers from 1 to 9, each appearing twice (for a total of 18 numbers). The numbers are randomly shuffled to form a draw pile.

2. **Player Totals**: Each player starts with a total sum of 0.

3. **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by random selection or mutual agreement).

## **Game Components**

- **Number Pool (Draw Pile)**: A list containing numbers 1 through 9, each appearing twice, shuffled randomly.

- **Player Totals**: An individual sum that each player maintains, starting at 0 and updated throughout the game.

- **Mystical Number**: The target total sum of **21** that players aim to reach exactly.

## **Turns**

1. **Draw Phase**: On their turn, the player draws the top number from the shared draw pile.

2. **Action Phase**: The player chooses one of the following actions:
   - **Add** the drawn number to their total sum.
   - **Subtract** the drawn number from their total sum.
   - **Pass** the drawn number to the opponent, who **must** add it to their total sum on their next turn before drawing a new number.

3. **End of Turn**: The turn ends after the player completes the Action Phase. The next player then takes their turn.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

- **Adding/Subtracting Numbers**:
  - Players may add or subtract the drawn number to/from their total sum during their Action Phase.
  - The total sum must always be between 0 and 21, inclusive. Negative totals are not allowed.

- **Passing Numbers**:
  - A player may choose to pass the drawn number to the opponent instead of adding or subtracting it.
  - The opponent is **obligated** to add the passed number to their total sum at the **start** of their next turn before drawing a new number.
  - A passed number cannot be passed back.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player wins if they reach a total sum of **exactly 21** on their turn.
  - If a player's total sum exceeds 21 at any point (immediately after adding a number), they lose the game.
  - If the draw pile is exhausted without any player reaching 21, the player with the total sum closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.

- **Ending Conditions**:
  - **Victory**: Achieving a total sum of exactly 21.
  - **Defeat**: Exceeding a total sum of 21.
  - **Exhausted Draw Pile**: If all numbers have been drawn, the player with the highest total sum not exceeding 21 wins.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**: The winner is declared based on the rules above. No ongoing scoring is needed beyond determining the winner of each game.

- **Strategic Depth**: Players can develop strategies around when to pass challenging numbers to opponents or how to manipulate their total sums to approach 21 efficiently.
