# Prime Multipliers: Rule Book

## Objective

**Prime Multipliers** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly 1,000** by multiplying a shared running total using prime numbers. Carefully choose your multipliers to navigate the total towards 1,000 without exceeding it. If a player's move causes the total to exceed 1,000, they lose. A skilled player can consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent through strategic planning.

## Setup

- The game starts with a **shared total** of **1**.
- Players decide who goes first (Player 1 and Player 2).
- The set of **allowed prime multipliers** is: **2, 3, 5, and 7**.
- No physical components are needed; all interactions occur via command-line inputs.

## Game Components

- **Shared Total**: A single integer value that both players manipulate. It starts at **1**.
- **Prime Multipliers**: The numbers **2**, **3**, **5**, and **7**. Players use these to multiply the shared total.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen multipliers through text commands.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Player's Action**:
  - On their turn, a player selects one **prime multiplier** from the allowed set.
  - The player multiplies the **shared total** by the chosen prime.
- **Progression**:
  - The new total is announced after each turn.
  - The game continues until someone wins or loses according to the rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Multipliers**:
   - Players must choose one of the allowed prime numbers: **2**, **3**, **5**, or **7**.
   - Only one prime multiplier can be used per turn.

2. **Updating the Shared Total**:
   - Multiply the current shared total by the chosen prime number.
   - Update the shared total with the new value.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player brings the shared total to **exactly 1,000**, they win immediately.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's move causes the shared total to exceed **1,000**, they lose immediately.
   - The opponent is declared the winner.

5. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players must ensure their chosen multiplier does not force the total over 1,000 unless they have no other valid moves.
   - If all possible multipliers would exceed 1,000, the current player loses.

6. **Strategy**:
   - Players should anticipate future totals to avoid exceeding 1,000.
   - Strategic selection of multipliers can force opponents into difficult positions.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who reaches exactly **1,000** with their move wins the game.
- **Losing**: The player who causes the total to exceed **1,000** loses the game.
- No points are tracked beyond determining the winner of each game.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Shared Total**: 1

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Multiplies by **5**.
- **Calculation**: 1 × 5 = **5**.
- **New Shared Total**: **5**.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Multiplies by **7**.
- **Calculation**: 5 × 7 = **35**.
- **New Shared Total**: **35**.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Multiplies by **3**.
- **Calculation**: 35 × 3 = **105**.
- **New Shared Total**: **105**.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Action**: Multiplies by **7**.
- **Calculation**: 105 × 7 = **735**.
- **New Shared Total**: **735**.

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Action**: Multiplies by **2**.
- **Calculation**: 735 × 2 = **1,470**.
- **Result**: Total exceeds **1,000**.
- **Outcome**: **Player 1 loses**. Player 2 wins.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample command-line interaction between two players.

```plaintext
--- Prime Multipliers Game Start ---
Shared Total: 1

Player 1, choose a prime multiplier (2, 3, 5, 7): 5
Player 1 multiplies by 5.
New Shared Total: 5

Player 2, choose a prime multiplier (2, 3, 5, 7): 7
Player 2 multiplies by 7.
New Shared Total: 35

Player 1, choose a prime multiplier (2, 3, 5, 7): 3
Player 1 multiplies by 3.
New Shared Total: 105

Player 2, choose a prime multiplier (2, 3, 5, 7): 7
Player 2 multiplies by 7.
New Shared Total: 735

Player 1, choose a prime multiplier (2, 3, 5, 7): 2
Player 1 multiplies by 2.
New Shared Total: 1470

Shared Total exceeded 1,000!
Player 1 loses. Player 2 wins!
```

### Strategic Notes

- **Avoid Overstepping**: Players should calculate potential future totals to avoid exceeding 1,000.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into a position where any multiplier they choose will make the total exceed 1,000.
- **Prime Selection**: Choosing smaller primes early may prolong the game and provide more control.
