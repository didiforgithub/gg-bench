The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` gym environment represent the numbers 1 to 9 that players can select during their turn. Index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9. Each index directly maps to its respective number by adding 1, as numbers are 1-based and indices are 0-based.
