# Light Switch Showdown

## Objective

Be the first player to create a sequence of **three consecutive ON lights** in a line of 10 lights. Players take turns toggling lights to achieve this goal while blocking their opponent from doing the same. The player who first arranges **three adjacent lights** to be **ON** wins the game.

## Setup

- **Lights**: A row of **10 lights** numbered from **1 to 10**.

  - Each light has two states:

  ```

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Actions**:

  - On your turn, **toggle one light** by changing its state from OFF to ON or from ON to OFF.
  - You may choose **any light** (1-10), regardless of its current state or previous moves.

- **Turn Progression**:

  - After toggling a light, the updated game board is displayed.
