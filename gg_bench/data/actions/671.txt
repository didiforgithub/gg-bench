In the gym environment for "Divisor Duel," the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.max_number - 1)`, where `self.max_number` corresponds to the starting number. This means the action space indices range from `0` to `max_number - 2`. Each action index `a` is mapped to a move involving a proper divisor of the current number, with the divisor being `a + 2`. This offset by 2 aligns the indices with the smallest possible proper divisor, which is 2, allowing actions to represent selecting divisors from 2 upwards.
