The action space indices (0 to 99) in the gym environment correspond to moves in the game by mapping each index to the integers 1 through 100, respectively. Specifically, an index `i` represents selecting the number `i + 1` as the move. This means index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 99, which corresponds to selecting the number 100.
