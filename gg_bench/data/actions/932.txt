In the game environment, the action space is defined using a discrete space with two indices: 0 and 1. The mapping between these indices and the corresponding moves are as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the move "Add 1" which increases the cumulative total by 1.
- Index 1 corresponds to the move "Multiply by 2" which doubles the cumulative total.
