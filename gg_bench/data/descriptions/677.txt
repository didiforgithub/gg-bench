# **Switch It: A Game of Tactical Flips**

## **Objective**

Be the first player to set all switches to your target state. Players compete to manipulate a series of switches, aiming to align them all to either **On** or **Off**, depending on their assigned target state. Victory is achieved when all switches match a player's target state at the end of their turn.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Game Initialization**:
   - The game consists of a row of **7 switches**, each of which can be in one of two states: **On** (`1`) or **Off** (`0`).
   - The initial state of each switch is set randomly. For example: `1 0 1 0 0 1 0`.

2. **Player Assignment**:
   - This is a **two-player** game.
   - **Player 1** is assigned the target state **On** (`1`).
   - **Player 2** is assigned the target state **Off** (`0`).

---

## **Game Components**

- **Switches**:
  - Represented as a sequence of binary values (`1`s and `0`s).
  - Each switch can be toggled between **On** (`1`) and **Off** (`0`).

- **Players**:
  - Each player has a specific target state:
    - **Player 1**: Aim to turn all switches **On** (`1`).
    - **Player 2**: Aim to turn all switches **Off** (`0`).

---

## **Turns**

- **Turn Order**:
  - **Player 1** makes the first move.
  - Players alternate turns thereafter.

- **Actions During a Turn**:
  - A player can perform **one** of the following actions:
    1. **Flip a Single Switch**:
       - Toggle the state of any one switch in the sequence.
    2. **Flip Two Adjacent Switches**:
       - Toggle the states of any two switches that are next to each other.

- **Progression of Turns**:
  - After a player makes their move, the game checks for victory conditions.
  - If no player has won, the turn passes to the other player.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Switch Flipping**:
   - **Flipping a Switch**:
     - Changing a switch from **On** (`1`) to **Off** (`0`), or vice versa.
   - **Legal Moves**:
     - Flipping any one switch.
     - Flipping two switches, provided they are adjacent in the sequence.

2. **Victory Condition**:
   - A player wins if, after their turn, **all switches** are in their target state.
     - **Player 1** wins if all switches are **On** (`1`).
     - **Player 2** wins if all switches are **Off** (`0`).

3. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw.
   - Due to the finite number of possible states and the alternating turns, a player will inevitably reach their target state given optimal play.

4. **Strategy**:
   - Players must anticipate their opponent's moves and plan accordingly.
   - Deciding whether to flip one switch or two can change the game's outcome.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who successfully turns all switches to their target state wins the game.
  - No point system is used; the outcome is win or loss.

- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of wins to determine an overall champion after a set number of games.

### **Sample Command-Line Interaction**

Assuming positions are numbered from 1 to 7 from left to right.

**Game Start**

- Initial Switch State: `1 0 1 0 0 1 0`
- Player 1's Target: `1` (On)
- Player 2's Target: `0` (Off)

**Player 1's Turn**

```
Current Switches: 1 0 1 0 0 1 0
Player 1, choose your action:
1. Flip one switch
2. Flip two adjacent switches
Enter 1 or 2: 2
Enter the positions of the two adjacent switches to flip (1-7):
Positions: 2 3

```

---

**Player 2's Turn**

```
Current Switches: 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
Player 2, choose your action:
1. Flip one switch
2. Flip two adjacent switches
Enter 1 or 2: 1
Enter the position of the switch to flip (1-7):
Position: 6
Switches after move: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**:
  - Keep track of which switches your opponent is likely to flip.
  - Plan your moves to counteract or preempt their strategy.

- **Optimal Use of Double Flips**:
  - Flipping two adjacent switches can be powerful but consider the consequences.
  - Sometimes flipping a single crucial switch is more effective.

- **Control the Center**:
  - Focus on the middle switches as they can influence the game more significantly.
  - Controlling central switches can make it harder for your opponent to achieve their goal.
