In the gym environment for the "Number Elimination Duel" game, the action space indices map directly to the numbers 1 through 15. Each index in the action space (ranging from 0 to 14) corresponds to its respective number by adding 1 to the index. Thus, an action of index 0 selects the number 1, index 1 selects the number 2, and so on up to index 14, which selects the number 15. This direct mapping allows players to choose numbers for elimination based on their index position in the action space.
