In the game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(max_starting_number + 1)`, representing all integers from 0 to `max_starting_number`. However, only actions corresponding to proper divisors of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself) are valid moves. The index of an action in the action space directly corresponds to the integer value being considered to subtract from the current number, but only those indices corresponding to valid divisors can be chosen on a player's turn. Actions outside this set will result in an invalid move, ending the game with a penalty.
