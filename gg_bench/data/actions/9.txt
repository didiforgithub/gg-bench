The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` environment map directly to possible divisors of the current shared number `N`. The indices range from 0 to `MAX_N`, where each index represents a potential divisor. In the game's logic, only proper divisors of `N` (excluding 1 and `N` itself) are valid moves. The environment checks whether the selected index corresponds to a valid proper divisor, and if it is, that divisor is used to divide `N`. Invalid selections result in penalties, reflecting the game's rules of only allowing proper divisors as valid actions.
