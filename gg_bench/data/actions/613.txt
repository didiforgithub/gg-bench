In the game environment, the action space is a discrete space with 21 indices (0 through 20), representing the selection of numbers 1 to 21 on the number line. Each action index directly corresponds to a number on the line, where action index `i` (ranging from 0 to 20) selects the number `i + 1`. For example, action index 0 selects number 1, action index 1 selects number 2, and so on, up to action index 20 selecting number 21. This mapping allows players to choose numbers by specifying the corresponding action index.
