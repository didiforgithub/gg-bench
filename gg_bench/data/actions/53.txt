In the game "Sequence Shift," the action space indices map to the swaps between adjacent positions as follows:

- Action 0: Swap positions 0 and 1
- Action 1: Swap positions 1 and 2
- Action 2: Swap positions 2 and 3
- Action 3: Swap positions 3 and 4

These indices represent swapping the numbers at these adjacent positions in the sequence.
