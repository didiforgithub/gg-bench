In the game, the action space indices correspond to the possible moves, which are the valid proper divisors of the current shared number. An action is valid if it is a proper divisor of the shared numberâ€”meaning it is a whole number greater than 1 and less than the shared number that divides it evenly. Each index in the action space represents a potential divisor, where only those that meet the criteria of being proper divisors are allowable actions. Invalid moves (not proper divisors) or an index of 0 or 1 (since these are not allowed as proper divisors) result in an invalid move.
