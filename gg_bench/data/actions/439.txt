The action space indices in the game map directly to the cells on the 5x5 grid, representing possible token placements. Each index corresponds to a unique cell, derived from considering the grid as a flattened list of cells indexed from 0 to 24. Specifically, the index `i` is mapped to the cell at row `i // 5` and column `i % 5`. For instance:
- Index `0` corresponds to cell `(0, 0)`
- Index `1` corresponds to cell `(0, 1)`
- Index `5` corresponds to cell `(1, 0)`
- Index `24` corresponds to cell `(4, 4)`

This provides a straightforward linear mapping from index to cell coordinates, enabling easy reflection of moves within the environment.
