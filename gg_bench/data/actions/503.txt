In the gym environment for Multiplication Duel, the action space is defined as `Discrete(8)`, representing indices from 0 to 7. Each index corresponds to a valid game move where an index `i` maps to a multiplier of `(i + 2)`. Thus, action index 0 corresponds to using a multiplier of 2, index 1 to a multiplier of 3, and so forth, up to index 7 which corresponds to a multiplier of 9.
