# **"Prime Time" Game Rule Book**

---

## **Objective**

Be the first player to construct a sequence of numbers whose cumulative sum is a **prime number greater than 50 but not exceeding 100**. Strategize your number selections to reach the prime sum before your opponent does, while ensuring your total does not surpass 100.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - The game is designed for two players.
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Player 1 takes the first turn.
   
2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Both players start with:
     - An **empty sequence** of numbers.
     - A **cumulative sum** starting at **zero**.
   - A **common pool** of numbers from **1 to 10** is available for both players.
   
3. **Game Interface:**
   - The game is played in a **command-line interface (CLI)**.
   - Players input their choices when prompted during their turn.

---

## **Game Components**

1. **Number Pool:**
   - **Numbers 1 through 10**.
   - All numbers are **always available** and can be selected **multiple times** by both players.

2. **Player Sequences:**
   - Each player maintains their own sequence of chosen numbers.
   - Sequences are **private**; opponents do not see each other's sequences.

3. **Cumulative Sum:**
   - The **total sum** of a player's sequence.
   - Players must keep track of their own cumulative sum.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players **alternate turns**, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Select a Number:**
     - Choose any number between **1 and 10** (inclusive) from the number pool.
     - Add the chosen number to your **sequence** and **cumulative sum**.
   - **No Passes:**
     - Players must select a number on their turn; passing is not allowed.
   
3. **Turn Progression:**
   - After a player completes their turn, the game prompts the next player.
   - The game continues until a **win** or **loss** condition is met.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection Rules:**
   - Players may select **any number** from **1 to 10** during their turn.
   - Numbers are **not removed** from the pool after selection; they can be reused.

2. **Cumulative Sum Rules:**
   - The chosen number is added to the player's **cumulative sum**.
   - Players must ensure their cumulative sum does **not exceed 100**.
   - Keeping track of the cumulative sum is the **player's responsibility**.

3. **Win Conditions:**
   - **Immediate Victory:** Achieved when your cumulative sum becomes a **prime number greater than 50** (i.e., 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97).
   - The victory occurs **as soon as** the cumulative sum meets the condition, even if it happens on the opponent's turn as a result of their error.

4. **Loss Conditions:**
   - **Exceeding 100:** If a player's cumulative sum exceeds **100**, they **immediately lose** the game.
   - **No Valid Moves:** If a player cannot select any number without exceeding 100, they lose.

5. **Information Disclosure:**
   - Players' sequences and cumulative sums are **private**.
   - Players may **voluntarily disclose** their cumulative sum, but are **not required** to do so.
   - Players should use **strategy and deduction** based on the gameplay.

6. **Fair Play:**
   - Players must **honestly track** and report their cumulative sums.
   - Cheating or misreporting sums is against the rules and results in an immediate loss.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game:**
  - Victory is achieved by reaching a cumulative sum that is a **prime number greater than 50**.
  - No additional scoring is tracked; the focus is on meeting the win condition.

- **Losing the Game:**
  - A player loses if their cumulative sum **exceeds 100**.
  - A player loses if they have **no valid moves** (cannot select any number without exceeding 100).

## **Examples**

### **Sample Gameplay**

**Turn 1:**

- **Player 1:**
  - Chooses **7**.
  - Cumulative sum: **0 + 7 = 7**.
- **Player 2:**
  - Chooses **10**.
  - Cumulative sum: **0 + 10 = 10**.

**Turn 2:**

- **Player 1:**
  - Chooses **8**.
  - Cumulative sum: **7 + 8 = 15**.
- **Player 2:**
  - Chooses **9**.
  - Cumulative sum: **10 + 9 = 19**.

**Turn 3:**

- **Player 1:**
  - Chooses **10**.
  - Cumulative sum: **15 + 10 = 25**.
- **Player 2:**
  - Chooses **10**.
  - Cumulative sum: **19 + 10 = 29**.

**Turn 4:**

- **Player 1:**
  - Chooses **9**.
  - Cumulative sum: **25 + 9 = 34**.
- **Player 2:**
  - Chooses **8**.
  - Cumulative sum: **29 + 8 = 37**.

**Turn 5:**

- **Player 1:**
  - Chooses **7**.
  - Cumulative sum: **34 + 7 = 41**.
- **Player 2:**
  - Chooses **10**.
  - Cumulative sum: **37 + 10 = 47**.

**Turn 6:**

- **Player 1:**
  - Chooses **7**.
  - Cumulative sum: **41 + 7 = 48**.
- **Player 2:**
  - Chooses **6**.
  - Cumulative sum: **47 + 6 = 53**.

**Outcome:**

- **Player 2** wins by reaching a cumulative sum of **53**, which is a prime number greater than 50.

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Prompt:** "Player 1, enter a number between 1 and 10:"
- **Input:** `7`
- **Output:** "You added 7 to your sequence. Your cumulative sum is now 7."

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Prompt:** "Player 2, enter a number between 1 and 10:"
- **Input:** `10`
- **Output:** "You added 10 to your sequence. Your cumulative sum is now 10."

*(Game continues with players inputting their choices as in the sample gameplay.)*

## **Strategy Tips**

- **Prime Number Awareness:**
  - Familiarize yourself with prime numbers greater than 50 up to 100 (53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97).
  - Aim to plan your sequence to reach one of these primes.

- **Cumulative Sum Management:**
  - Keep track of your cumulative sum carefully to avoid exceeding 100.
  - Consider the possible sums resulting from your choices and how they align with prime numbers.

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves:**
  - While you cannot see the opponent's sum, consider common strategies and numbers they might select.
  - Use deduction to estimate their cumulative sum based on the pace of the game.

- **Balancing Risk and Reward:**
  - Weigh the benefits of adding larger numbers to reach the prime sum sooner against the risk of exceeding 100.
  - Sometimes selecting smaller numbers can prolong the game, giving you more control.

---

## **Game End**

- The game ends immediately when a player **wins** by reaching the prime sum or **loses** by exceeding 100.
- Celebratory or concluding messages can be displayed to acknowledge the winner.
