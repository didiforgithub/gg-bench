In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 17, corresponding to selecting numbers from 2 to 19. Specifically, an action index `i` represents the selection of the number `i + 2`. For instance, action index 0 selects the number 2, index 1 selects 3, and so on, up to index 17 selecting 19. This mapping allows players to choose a number during their turn by selecting the respective index in the action space.
