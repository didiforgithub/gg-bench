The action space indices in the game environment map directly to the numbers available in the shared number pool. Specifically, an action index \( i \) corresponds to selecting the number \( i + 1 \) from the pool. Thus, the indices 0 through 49 represent the numbers 1 through 50, respectively. This mapping allows players to choose numbers by their index position in the range of potential actions.
