The action space in the gym environment is defined by `spaces.Discrete(starting_N + 1)`, meaning actions are indexed from 0 to the starting number (60). In this setup, each action index corresponds directly to an integer, where an action `i` represents the player attempting to subtract `i` from the current number, `N`. However, only indices corresponding to valid proper divisors of `N` (greater than 1 and less than `N`) are legal moves. Actions that do not correspond to proper divisors result in an invalid move, ending the game.
