**Game Title:** Grid Blockade

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to reach your opponent's starting position on a 5x5 grid while strategically placing blocks to hinder their progress. Utilize movement and blocking to outmaneuver your opponent and claim victory.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Grid Creation:** Create a 5x5 grid, consisting of 25 cells arranged in 5 rows and 5 columns. Each cell is identified by its coordinates `(row, column)`, where both `row` and `column` range from 0 to 4.

2. **Starting Positions:**
   - **Player 1** starts at the top-left corner of the grid at position `(0, 0)`.
   - **Player 2** starts at the bottom-right corner of the grid at position `(4, 4)`.

3. **Initial Conditions:** All other cells on the grid are empty and unblocked at the start of the game.

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Grid Cells:**
   - Represented by coordinate pairs `(row, column)`.
   - Can be in one of three states: empty, occupied by a player, or blocked.

2. **Player Tokens:**
   - **Player 1 Token:** Represents Player 1's current position on the grid.
   - **Player 2 Token:** Represents Player 2's current position on the grid.

3. **Blocking Tokens:**
   - Used to block cells on the grid.
   - A blocked cell cannot be entered or passed through by either player.

---

### **Turns**

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- On each turn, a player must choose one of the following actions:
  1. **Move Action:** Move their token to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).
  2. **Block Action:** Place a blocking token on any unoccupied and unblockaded cell that is not the opponent's current position or starting position.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

#### **Movement Rules**

- **Adjacency:** A move can only be made to a cell that is directly adjacent horizontally or vertically (no diagonal moves).
- **Occupied and Blocked Cells:** Players cannot move into a cell that is occupied by the other player or that is blocked.
- **Staying in Place:** A player cannot choose to skip a move; they must either move or place a block.

#### **Blocking Rules**

- **Placement:** Blocks can be placed on any unoccupied and unblockaded cell that is not:
  - The current position of either player.
  - The starting position of either player.
- **Effect of Blocks:**
  - Once placed, blocks remain on the grid for the duration of the game.
  - Blocks prevent movement into or through the blocked cell.

#### **Winning the Game**

- **Victory Condition:** The first player to reach the opponent's starting position wins the game.
- **Impeded Progress:**
  - If a player cannot make any legal moves on their turn (i.e., they are completely blocked), they lose the game.
  - If both players are blocked simultaneously and cannot reach the opponent's starting position, the player who is closer to the opponent's starting position wins.
  - Closeness is determined by the Manhattan distance (the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates) to the opponent's starting position.

---

### **Scoring**

- This game does not involve point scoring.
- The objective is to win the game by reaching the opponent's starting position.
- Each game results in a clear win or lossâ€”there are no draws.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Balance Movement and Blocking:** Wisely choose between advancing toward your opponent's starting position and placing blocks to hinder their progress.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves:** Anticipate the paths your opponent may take and block critical cells to force them into longer routes.
- **Maintain Options:** Avoid creating situations where you have limited movement options. Keep multiple paths open toward your goal.
- **Control the Center:** Dominating the center of the grid can provide more movement options and blocking opportunities.
