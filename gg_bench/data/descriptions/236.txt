# Multiplication Showdown: Rule Book

## Objective

**Be the first player to reach exactly 100 by multiplying the current total by a number between 2 and 9.**  
- Players take turns multiplying the current total.
- The player who reaches **exactly 100** wins the game.
- **If a player exceeds 100, they lose immediately.**

## Setup

1. **Players:** Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
2. **Starting Total:** The game begins with a **current total of 1**.
3. **Decide First Player:** Players can flip a coin or agree on who takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Current Total:** An integer value that starts at 1 and changes as players take turns.
- **Multipliers:** Numbers from **2 to 9 (inclusive)** that players can use to multiply the current total.
- **Players' Inputs:** Each player selects a multiplier on their turn.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Display Current Total:** Announce the current total at the start of each turn.
2. **Player's Move:**
   - The active player selects a multiplier between **2 and 9**.
   - Multiplier must be an integer within the allowed range.
3. **Update Total:** Multiply the current total by the chosen multiplier.
4. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions:**
   - **Win:** If the new total is **exactly 100**, the active player wins.
   - **Loss:** If the new total exceeds **100**, the active player loses.
5. **Pass Turn:** If no win/loss, the turn passes to the other player with the updated total.

### Turn Order

- The game proceeds in an alternating fashion:
  - **Player 1's Turn**
  - **Player 2's Turn**
  - Repeat until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Allowed Multipliers:** On their turn, players must choose an integer between **2 and 9**.
2. **Valid Moves:** The chosen multiplier must be such that the new total does not exceed 100 unless the player accepts the loss.
3. **No Skipping Turns:** Players cannot pass or skip their turn.
4. **Exact Total to Win:** A player must reach **exactly 100** to win the game.
5. **Exceeding 100:** If a player's move causes the total to exceed 100, they **immediately lose**.
6. **Input Validation:** If a player selects an invalid multiplier (outside 2-9), they should be prompted again.

### Special Conditions

- **Strategic Play:** Players can plan ahead to force their opponent into a losing position.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw; it continues until one player wins or loses.

## Scoring

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current Total:** 5
- **Player 2's Move:** Chooses multiplier **9**
- **Calculation:** 5 × 9 = **45**
- **New Total:** **45**
- **Pass Turn to Player 1**

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current Total:** 45
- **Player 1's Move:** Chooses multiplier **2**
- **Calculation:** 45 × 2 = **90**
- **New Total:** **90**
- **Pass Turn to Player 2**

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current Total:** 90
- **Player 2's Move:** Chooses multiplier **2**
- **Calculation:** 90 × 2 = **180**
- **New Total:** **180**
- **Outcome:** Total exceeds 100.
- **Player 2 Loses.**

**Winner:** **Player 1**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start**

```
Welcome to Multiplication Showdown!
Starting total is 1.
Player 1, it's your turn.
Current total: 1
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 5
New total is 5.
```

**Next Turn**

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Current total: 5
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 9
New total is 45.
```

**Proceeding Turns**

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Current total: 45
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
New total is 90.

Player 2, it's your turn.
Current total: 90
Choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
New total is 180.
Total exceeds 100!

Player 2 has exceeded 100 and loses the game.
Congratulations, Player 1! You win!
```

### Strategic Considerations

- **Avoiding Exceeding 100:** Players should calculate potential outcomes to ensure they don't exceed 100 on their turn.
- **Forcing Opponent's Hand:** Players can make moves that limit the opponent's safe multipliers.
- **Example Strategy:**
  - If the current total is **10**, and you choose **9**, the new total is **90**.
  - Your opponent now risks exceeding 100 with most multipliers.
