# Number Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce your opponent's Health Points (HP) to zero or below. Utilize strategic attacks and defenses to outmaneuver your opponent and win the duel.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Starting Health**: Each player begins with **10 Health Points (HP)**.
- **Starting Turn**: Determine who goes first (e.g., coin toss, random selection).

## Game Components

- **Health Points (HP)**:
  - Represents a player's remaining life.
  - Each player starts with 10 HP.
  - HP cannot exceed 10 at any point.
- **Attack Values**:
  - On their turn, players choose an attack value between **1 and 5** (inclusive).

## Turns

1. **Attack Phase**:
   - The **Attacker** declares an attack value (1-5).
   - Example: "I attack with a value of 4."
2. **Defense Phase**:
   - The **Defender** chooses to **Block** or **Counter-Attack**:
     - **Block**:
       - Reduces incoming damage by **2 points** (minimum damage is 0).
       - Defender says: "I choose to block."
     - **Counter-Attack**:
       - Defender sacrifices **1 HP** to reflect the full attack back to the Attacker.
       - Defender says: "I choose to counter-attack."
3. **Damage Resolution**:
   - Calculate and apply damage based on the Defender's choice.
4. **End of Turn**:
   - Swap roles: the Attacker becomes the Defender, and vice versa.
   - Continue to the next turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Attack Values

- The Attacker must choose an integer value between **1 and 5**.
- This value represents the strength of their attack.

### Defense Options

1. **Block**:
   - Reduces the attack's damage by **2 HP**.
   - Damage to Defender = Attack Value - 2 (minimum of 0).
   - Defender does **not** lose additional HP beyond incoming damage.
2. **Counter-Attack**:
   - Defender loses **1 HP** immediately for counter-attacking.
   - The full attack value is reflected back as damage to the Attacker.
   - Damage to Attacker = Attack Value.
   - Defender takes no further damage from the attack.

### Health Points (HP)

- HP cannot exceed the starting value of **10**.
- A player's HP is reduced by the damage taken.
- If a player's HP drops to **0 or below**, they lose the game.
- Negative HP is allowed for calculation purposes but signifies defeat.

### Winning the Game

- The game ends immediately when a player's HP reaches **0 or less** at the end of a turn.
- The opposing player is declared the winner.
- There are no draws; the game continues until one player wins.

## Scoring

- **HP Tracking**:
  - Keep a running total of each player's HP after every turn.
  - Players should announce their remaining HP at the end of their turn.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to reduce their opponent's HP to **0 or below** wins.

## Strategy Tips

- **Balancing Attack Values**:
  - Higher attacks can deal more damage but may be riskier if counter-attacked.
  - Lower attacks might be safer but may not reduce your opponent's HP quickly.
- **Choosing to Block vs. Counter-Attack**:
  - **Block** when you want to minimize damage and preserve HP.
  - **Counter-Attack** when you can afford the 1 HP cost and want to inflict damage back.
- **Monitoring HP Levels**:
  - Pay attention to both players' HP to make informed decisions.
  - Use high attacks when your opponent has low HP to try to finish the game.
- **Predicting Opponent's Moves**:
  - Anticipate whether your opponent is likely to block or counter-attack based on their HP.
