In the game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 27 possible actions, each corresponding to choosing a digit and placing it in a specific position. The mapping of action space indices to game moves is as follows:

- Each action index ranges from 0 to 26.
- The index is divided by 3 to determine the digit to select, with the quotient representing the digit index (0 means digit 1, 1 means digit 2, etc.).
- The remainder of the division by 3 determines the position to place the selected digit (0 for Hundreds, 1 for Tens, 2 for Units).

For example, an action index of 4 corresponds to digit 2 (since 4 // 3 = 1, and digit index 1 + 1 = 2) being placed in the Tens position (since 4 % 3 = 1).
