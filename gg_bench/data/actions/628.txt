In the game, the action space indices are mapped to game moves as follows:

- **Indices 0-8**: Correspond to adding numbers 1-9 to the player's sequence. The index represents the number minus one (e.g., index 0 is the number 1, index 8 is the number 9).
  
- **Indices 9-36**: Correspond to guessing the opponent's sequence type. Each group of indices represents different sequence types or parameters:
  - **9-18**: Guess arithmetic sequences with various common differences (-5 to 5, excluding 0). The index indicates a specific difference.
  - **19-22**: Guess geometric sequences with different common ratios (2 to 5).
  - **23-30**: Guess multiples of various numbers (2 to 9).
  - **31-36**: Guess other sequence types without parameters: Fibonacci, prime, square, cube, even, or odd numbers, in that order. Each index specifies a particular type.
