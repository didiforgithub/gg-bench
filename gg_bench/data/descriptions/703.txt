**Pattern Match**

_A strategic two-player turn-based game designed for command-line play._

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Pattern Match** is to be the first player to create a straight line—row, column, or diagonal—of numbers that sum up to **15** on your personal 3x3 grid. Achieving this sum in any straight line constitutes a win. If a player successfully creates such a line, they win the game. There is no draw mechanism; play continues until a player wins.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Grids Initialization**: Each player has their own 3x3 grid, which starts empty. Grids are labeled with rows 1-3 and columns 1-3 for easy reference.

2. **Number Pool**: A shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9** is available. Each number is unique and can be used only once in the game.

3. **Player Positions**: Players decide who will take the first turn, either by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

---

### **Game Components**

- **3x3 Grids**: Each grid is a square composed of 9 cells arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. Players fill these grids during the game.

- **Number Tokens (1-9)**: Single instances of the numbers from 1 to 9. Each number can be used only once in the game, by either player.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player who was chosen to go first during setup.

- **Actions per Turn**:

  1. **Select a Number**: Choose an unused number from the shared pool (numbers 1-9).

  2. **Place the Number**: Place the selected number into any empty cell on **your own** grid.

- **Progression**: After a player completes their turn by placing a number, the turn passes to the other player.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:

   - **Unique Usage**: Once a number is selected by a player, it is no longer available for either player.
   - **Available Numbers**: Players can only select from numbers that have not yet been used.

2. **Placement Rules**:

   - **Own Grid Only**: Players place numbers only on their own grid.
   - **Empty Cells**: Numbers must be placed in an empty cell.
   - **No Replacements**: Once placed, numbers cannot be moved or replaced.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - **Sum of 15**: The objective is to have any row, column, or diagonal in your grid where the three numbers sum to exactly **15**.
   - **Winning Configuration Examples**:
     - **Row**: Numbers in cells (Row 2, Columns 1-3) sum to 15.
     - **Column**: Numbers in cells (Rows 1-3, Column 3) sum to 15.
     - **Diagonal**: Numbers in cells (Row 1, Column 1), (Row 2, Column 2), and (Row 3, Column 3) sum to 15.

4. **Game End Conditions**:

   - **Win**: A player wins immediately upon creating a line that sums to 15.
   - **Continuation**: If all numbers have been used and no player has achieved the sum of 15 in a line, the game continues by allowing players to replace one of their own numbers in the grid with an unused number (if any remain).
   - **No Draws**: The game continues indefinitely until a player wins; draws are not possible.

5. **Strategic Depth**:

   - **Blocking**: Players must consider not only their own grid but also anticipate the opponent's moves to prevent them from winning.
   - **Number Availability**: Keeping track of which numbers have been used adds a layer of strategy.

### **Scoring**

- **Winning**: Victory is achieved by being the first player to align three numbers in a row, column, or diagonal that sum to 15.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking; the focus is on achieving the game's objective to win.

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 2** selects number **8** and places it at (Row 1, Column 3).

  Command-line input:
  ```
  Player 2, select a number: 8
  Choose grid position (row and column): 1 3
  ```

- **Available Numbers** now: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1** selects number **6** and places it at (Row 1, Column 1).
