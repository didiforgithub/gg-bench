The action space indices (0 to 19) in the CustomEnv map directly to the positions on the number line for the game Divisor Line. Each index corresponds to placing a marker on the respective number from 1 to 20, where index 0 maps to number 1, index 1 maps to number 2, and so forth up to index 19 mapping to number 20.
