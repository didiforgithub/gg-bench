In the gym environment for the game "Multiplication Mayhem," the action space indices are mapped to the game's multiplier moves as follows: the action indices 0 through 7 correspond to the multipliers 2 through 9, respectively. Thus, when a player selects an action index `i`, it translates to choosing the multiplier `i + 2` for updating the running total.
