The action space indices map to the game moves by representing the proper divisors of the current number. In the environment, each action index corresponds to a potential divisor that a player can choose. Specifically, the action index is given by `divisor - 2`, meaning each index maps to a divisor starting from `2`. When a player selects an action with index `i`, it corresponds to choosing the divisor `i + 2`. This ensures that the indices start at 0 for the smallest possible divisor, which is 2, and increase sequentially for each valid divisor.
