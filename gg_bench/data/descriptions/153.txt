# Word Scrape

## Objective

Be the player to remove the last letter(s) from a shared word, thereby winning the game. Players take turns removing one or two adjacent letters from the word, strategically planning to be the one to deplete the word completely.

## Setup

1. **Choose a Starting Word**: Select a word that is at least **seven letters long**. The word should not have repeating sequences of letters to ensure fairness. Examples of suitable words include "EXAMPLE", "BALANCE", "GARDENS".

2. **Decide Player Order**: Determine who will take the first turn. This can be decided by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

3. **Display the Word**: Write down or display the starting word clearly so both players can see it. In a command-line interface, the word can be printed to the screen.

## Game Components

- **Shared Word**: A single word consisting of letters (e.g., "EXAMPLE").
- **Players**: Two participants who will alternate turns modifying the shared word.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The medium through which players input their moves and view the game's state.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Player Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must remove either **one** or **two** adjacent letters from the current word.
  - The letters removed must be next to each other in the word.
- **Progression**: After letters are removed, the remaining letters shift to close any gaps, forming a new word with the original order preserved.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Letter Removal**:
   - Players can remove either one or two adjacent letters on their turn.
   - The selected letters must be consecutive within the word.
   - Only valid if at least one letter remains after the move (unless it's the last move of the game).

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - A player **cannot skip** their turn.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (no letters remain to remove), they **lose** the game.
   - Players must be careful not to leave themselves without a valid move on their next turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who removes the **last letter(s)** from the word wins.
   - Strategy involves not only removing letters but also leaving the opponent with limited options.

4. **Game Integrity**:
   - Players must not rearrange the letters.
   - Only removal of letters is allowed; no other modifications can be made.
   - All moves should be clearly communicated and agreed upon.

## Scoring

- **Single Game Victory**: The player who removes the last letter(s) wins the game.
- **Match Play**:
  - Players can agree to play a series of games (e.g., best of three).
  - Keep track of individual game wins to determine the overall winner.

## Examples

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- Remaining Word: **E**

**Turn 6: Player 2**

**Result**: Player 2 wins.

### Example 2: Command-Line Interaction with "GARDENS"

**Starting Word**: G A R D E N S

**Turn 1: Player 1**
- **Input**: Remove letters at positions 1-2 ("G A")
- **Remaining Word**: **R D E N S**

**Turn 2: Player 2**
- **Input**: Remove letter at position 3 ("E")
- **Remaining Word**: **R D N S**

**Turn 3: Player 1**
- **Input**: Remove letters at positions 2-3 ("D N")
- **Remaining Word**: **R S**

**Turn 4: Player 2**
- **Input**: Remove letters at positions 1-2 ("R S")
- **Remaining Word**: *(Empty)*

**Result**: Player 2 wins.

### Example 3: Strategy with "EXAMPLE"

**Starting Word**: E X A M P L E

**Turn 1: Player 1**
- Removes: "E X"
- Remaining Word: **A M P L E**

**Turn 2: Player 2**
- Removes: "P"
- Remaining Word: **A M L E**

**Turn 3: Player 1**
- Removes: "A"
- Remaining Word: **M L E**

**Turn 4: Player 2**
- Removes: "M"
- Remaining Word: **L E**

**Turn 5: Player 1**
- Removes: "L E" (both letters)
- Remaining Word: *(Empty)*

**Result**: Player 1 wins.

## Additional Notes

- **Strategic Tips**:
  - Plan ahead to control the game's progression.
  - Try to force your opponent into a position where they have no winning moves.
  - Be mindful of the number of letters remaining and the possible combinations.

- **Command-Line Implementation**:
  - Display the word with letters numbered for clarity.
  - Players input the positions of the letters they wish to remove.
  - Validate moves to ensure they follow the rules.

- **Variations**:
  - Start with longer words for added complexity.
  - Introduce a time limit per turn to increase the challenge.
  - Use thematic words related to a particular category (e.g., animals, countries).

## Conclusion

Word Scrape is a simple yet strategic game that tests players' foresight and planning abilities. With straightforward rules and easy command-line implementation, it's perfect for quick matches that still offer depth and competitiveness.

Enjoy the duel of wits as you scrape away letters and outmaneuver your opponent to claim victory!
