# Elemental Clash

## Objective

**Elemental Clash** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where each player takes on the role of a powerful mage. The primary goal is to reduce your opponent's Health Points (HP) to zero by casting elemental spells. Utilize your spell elements wisely to overcome your opponent's defenses and emerge victorious.

## Setup

1. **Health Points:**
   - Each player starts the game with **10 Health Points (HP)**.

2. **Spell Elements:**
   - Each player has a set of **four spell elements**:
     - **Fire**
     - **Water**
     - **Earth**
     - **Air**
   - These spell elements are available at the beginning of the game and can **only be used once**.

3. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide who will go first (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

4. **Game Interface:**
   - The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their choices when prompted.

### Spell Interaction Chart

This chart determines the outcome of spell clashes:

|---------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Fire**            | Tie         | Loses       | Wins        | Wins        |
| **Water**           | Wins        | Tie         | Wins        | Loses       |
| **Earth**           | Loses       | Loses       | Tie         | Wins        |
| **Air**             | Loses       | Wins        | Loses       | Tie         |

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Attack Phase:**
   - The active player (attacker) selects one of their **remaining spell elements** to cast as an attack.
   - The chosen spell is declared openly (e.g., `"Player 1 attacks with Fire"`).

2. **Defense Phase:**
   - The defending player selects one of their **remaining spell elements** to defend.
   - The defense spell is declared after the attack spell is known (e.g., `"Player 2 defends with Water"`).

3. **Resolution Phase:**
   - Determine the outcome using the **Spell Interaction Chart**.
   - Adjust HP based on the result:
     - **Attacker Wins:** Defender loses **2 HP**.
     - **Defender Wins:** Attacker loses **1 HP**.
     - **Tie:** Both players lose **1 HP**.

4. **Discard Used Spells:**
   - Both used spell elements are discarded and cannot be used again.

5. **Check for Victory:**
   - If a player's HP is reduced to **0 or below**, the game ends, and the other player wins.
   - If both players' HP reach **0** simultaneously, the attacker wins.

6. **Next Turn:**
   - If no victory condition is met, the roles switch, and the next player becomes the attacker.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Spell Usage:**
   - Each spell element can be used **only once per game**.
   - Players must manage their spells strategically.

2. **Elemental Strengths and Weaknesses:**
   - Use the **Spell Interaction Chart** to determine outcomes.
   - The chart is based on traditional elemental relationships (e.g., Water extinguishes Fire).

3. **Health Points Adjustment:**
   - HP is adjusted **immediately** after each Resolution Phase.
   - Players cannot have negative HP; if HP drops below 0, it is considered 0.

4. **Victory Conditions:**
   - A player wins when their opponent's HP reaches **0**.
   - **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw; it continues until one player wins.

5. **Element Availability:**
   - Keep track of your remaining spell elements.
   - You cannot select a spell that has already been used.

6. **Game Continuation:**
   - If a player has no remaining spell elements, they automatically lose on their next turn when they cannot perform an action.

## Scoring

- **Health Points (HP):**
  - Represents the player's score during the game.
  - The objective is to reduce your opponent's HP to **0** while maintaining your own.
- **No Additional Scoring:**
  - There are no points beyond HP, and no tie-breakers; the game is won by depleting the opponent's HP.
