# Tower of Numbers

## Objective

**Tower of Numbers** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to build a tower that reaches **exactly 15 units in height** by stacking numbered blocks according to specific rules. Players must carefully select and place blocks to reach the target height without exceeding it. The game requires foresight and planning, allowing a skilled player to consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent.

## Setup

1. **Initialize the Game Environment**:
   - Start the game in a command-line interface.
   - Display the list of available blocks numbered from **1** to **9**.

2. **Player Identification**:
   - Determine which player will go first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Prepare Player Towers**:
   - Each player begins with an empty tower.
   - The target tower height is set to **15 units** for both players.

## Game Components

1. **Blocks**:
   - **Numbered Blocks (1-9)**: Each block is assigned a number from **1** to **9**, representing its height in units.
   - **Unique Usage**: Each block can be used **only once** in the game. Once a block is placed by either player, it is no longer available.

2. **Player Towers**:
   - Each player has their own tower where they stack blocks during their turns.
   - Towers start empty and grow as blocks are added.

3. **Target Height**:
   - The target height for the tower is **15 units**. Players aim to reach this exact height.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Select a Block**: Choose one block from the list of available blocks.
   - **Place the Block**: Add the selected block to the top of your tower, following the stacking rules.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a player completes their turn, the next player takes their turn.
   - The game continues until a player wins or no valid moves remain.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Block Selection and Placement

1. **Available Blocks**:
   - At the start, blocks numbered **1** to **9** are available.
   - Once a block is selected by either player, it is removed from the pool of available blocks.

2. **Stacking Rules**:
   - **Non-Increasing Order**: When adding a block to your tower, the number on the new block must be **less than or equal to** the number on the block directly beneath it.
     - *Example*: A block numbered **5** can be placed on top of a block numbered **5** or higher (e.g., **5**, **6**, **7**, **8**, **9**).
     - *Invalid Move*: You cannot place a block numbered **7** on top of a block numbered **5**.

3. **Tower Height Limit**:
   - The sum of the block numbers (heights) in your tower cannot exceed **15 units**.
   - If placing a block would cause your tower to exceed 15 units, you **cannot** place that block.

### Winning the Game

1. **Exact Height Victory**:
   - The first player to reach a tower height of **exactly 15 units** wins the game immediately.

2. **Exceeding the Height**:
   - If a player's tower exceeds 15 units, they **lose** the game automatically.

3. **No Valid Moves**:
   - If neither player can make a valid move (no available blocks can be legally placed without exceeding 15 units or violating stacking rules), the player with the **highest tower height not exceeding 15 units** wins.

### Additional Rules

1. **Skipping a Turn**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (no blocks can be legally placed), they must **skip** their turn.

2. **Game End Conditions**:
   - The game ends when a player reaches exactly 15 units, exceeds 15 units, or when no valid moves remain for both players.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The winner is the player who successfully builds a tower of exactly **15 units** first or has the highest valid tower when no further moves are possible.
- There is no point tracking; the game is won by meeting the objective conditions.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Initial Available Blocks**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 1:

- **Player 1**:
  - **Selects Block**: 9
  - **Places On Tower**: Block 9
  - **Tower Height**: 9 units
  - **Available Blocks**: 1-8

#### Turn 2:

- **Player 2**:
  - **Selects Block**: 8
  - **Places On Tower**: Block 8
  - **Tower Height**: 8 units
  - **Available Blocks**: 1-7

#### Turn 3:

- **Player 1**:
  - **Needs**: 6 units to reach 15 (15 - 9 = 6)
  - **Possible Blocks to Use**: 6 or less (cannot exceed needed units)
  - **Valid Blocks (≤9 and ≤6)**: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
  - **Selects Block**: 6
  - **Places On Tower**: Block 6
  - **Stacking Rule Valid**: 6 ≤ 9
  - **Tower Height**: 9 + 6 = **15 units**
  - **Available Blocks**: 1-5, 7

- **Player 1 wins** by reaching exactly 15 units.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Players should anticipate which blocks will be available in future turns and how their opponent might use them.
- **Block Denial**: Selecting a block that your opponent may need can prevent them from reaching 15 units.
- **Tower Height Management**: Avoid exceeding 15 units. Always calculate the potential tower height before placing a block.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```plaintext
