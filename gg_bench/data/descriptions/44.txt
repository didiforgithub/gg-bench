**Number Tower**

**Objective:**

Number Tower is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where players build a shared tower by stacking numbered blocks. The primary goal is to be the last player to successfully place a block on the tower without violating the balance rules. A player wins by placing all their blocks or by forcing the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

---

**Setup:**

1. **Block Allocation:**
   - Each player receives a set of blocks numbered from **1** to **10**. These blocks are unique to each player and are not shared.
   - The blocks can be represented in the command-line interface as numbers in a list or an array.

2. **Starting the Tower:**
   - The game begins with an empty tower, considered to have a base value of **0**.
   - Players decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by mutual agreement or a simple randomization).

---

**Game Components:**

1. **Blocks:**
   - **Numbered Blocks (1-10):** Each block has a numerical value from **1** to **10**.
   - **Appearance:** In a command-line interface, blocks are represented by their numerical value.
   - **Functionality:** Blocks are used to build the tower by stacking them according to the game's balance rules.

2. **Tower:**
   - **Structure:** A single stack where blocks are placed one on top of another.
   - **Representation:** The tower can be displayed as a list or array showing the sequence of blocks from the base upwards.

3. **Player Hands:**
   - Each player's remaining blocks are kept in their hand and displayed to them during their turn.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - On each turn, a player must attempt to place one block from their hand onto the tower.

2. **Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Select a Block:** Choose a block from your available blocks.
   - **Place the Block:** Attempt to place the selected block on top of the tower while adhering to the balance rules.
   - **Update Hands and Tower:** Remove the placed block from your hand and add it to the top of the tower.
   - **Check for Victory or Loss:** Determine if the move results in a win, loss, or continuation of the game.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - After a successful placement, the turn passes to the opponent.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose the game.

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Block Placement Rules:**
   - **Initial Placement:** The first block placed on the empty tower (base value of **0**) can be any block from **1** to **10**.
   - **Subsequent Placements:** When placing a block on top of the tower, the following balance rule must be observed:
     - **Balance Rule:** The numerical value of the new block must be **less than or equal to** the **sum** of the numerical values of the **two** blocks immediately beneath it.
     - If there is only one block beneath (i.e., the tower has only one block), the new block's value must be **less than or equal to** the value of that single block.

2. **Valid Moves:**
   - A move is valid if the block placement adheres to the balance rule.
   - Players must select a block from their remaining hand.

3. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If a player cannot place any of their remaining blocks without violating the balance rule, they lose the game.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins by:
     - Successfully placing all their blocks onto the tower.
     - Forcing the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves on their turn.

5. **Tower Stability:**
   - The tower is considered stable if all blocks have been placed according to the balance rule.
   - No adjustments are made to the tower after a block is placed.

6. **Example of the Balance Rule:**
   - If the top two blocks on the tower have numerical values of **3** and **5** (from top to second block), the sum is **8**.
   - The next block placed must have a value **less than or equal to 8**.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Win/Loss Condition:**
  - The game does not use a point-based scoring system.
  - The outcome is determined by the win or loss condition as described in the rules.
- **Optional Variations:**
  - Players may agree to play multiple rounds and keep track of victories to determine an overall winner after a set number of games.
