---

## Game Components

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Attack Action

- **Selecting an Attack:**
  - Choose an unused attack value from **1** to **10**.
  - Declare the chosen attack value.
- **Inflicting Damage:**
  - Subtract the attack value from the opponent's HP.
  - Example: If you attack with **7**, the opponent loses **7 HP**.
- **Attack Availability:**
  - Each attack value can be used only once per player.
  - Attack values used are tracked separately for each player.

### 2. Defend Action

- **Activating Defense:**
  - Announce your decision to defend instead of attacking.
- **Effect of Defense:**
  - Reduces damage from the opponent's next attack by **half** (rounded down).
  - Example: If the opponent attacks with **7**, damage is reduced to **3**.
- **Defense Cooldown:**
  - After defending, you cannot defend again on your immediate next turn.
  - You must perform an attack on your next turn before defending again.

### 3. Health Points (HP)

- **Starting HP:** Both players begin with **100 HP**.
- **Health Reduction:**
  - HP decreases when a player takes damage from an attack.
  - HP cannot go below **0 HP**.

  - Health points are public and must be disclosed upon request.

### 4. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:**
  - Reduce your opponent's HP to **0** or below.
- **Simultaneous Defeat:**
  - If both players reach **0 HP** on the same turn, the player who initiated the attack wins.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Attack Value Management:**
  - Use high attack values to deal significant damage but save them for critical moments.
  - Be aware of which attack values you have left to avoid being forced into low-damage attacks.

- **Predicting Opponent Moves:**
  - Keep track of the opponent's used attacks to anticipate their potential moves.
  - If the opponent has used their high attack values, it might be safer to attack rather than defend.

- **Optimal Use of Defense:**
  - Defend when you suspect the opponent will use a high attack value.
  - Remember the cooldown; plan your defense turns accordingly.

- **Balancing Offense and Defense:**
  - Overusing defense may leave you without progress in reducing the opponent's HP.
  - Constant attacking without considering defense may expose you to significant damage.
