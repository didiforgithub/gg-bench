In the Galaxy Conquest gym environment, each action is mapped to a specific combination of a planet to attack and a ship to deploy. The action space has 49 discrete actions, corresponding to 7 planets and 7 ships. The action index is split as follows:

- The integer division of the action index by 7 (`action // 7`) determines the planet number, ranging from 1 to 7. This represents the planet targeted for attack.
- The modulo operation of the action index by 7 (`action % 7`) determines the ship number, ranging from 1 to 7. This represents the ship used in the attack.

Each action index, therefore, corresponds to attacking a specific planet with a specific ship by mapping these two components.
