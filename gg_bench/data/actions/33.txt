The action space indices (0 through 7) map directly to the numbers in the shared list (2 through 9), where index 0 corresponds to number 2, index 1 to number 3, and so on, up to index 7 which corresponds to number 9. Each index refers to a possible action a player can take by removing the corresponding number from the list.
