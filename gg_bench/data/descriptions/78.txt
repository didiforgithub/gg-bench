- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1 (P1)**: Starts on the top row, middle column (Row 1, Column 3).
  - **Player 2 (P2)**: Starts on the bottom row, middle column (Row 5, Column 3).
- Players decide randomly who takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid represented as a matrix, with rows numbered 1 to 5 (top to bottom) and columns numbered 1 to 5 (left to right).
- **Player Pieces**:
  - **P1's Piece**: Represented by `P1` on the grid.
  - **P2's Piece**: Represented by `P2` on the grid.
- **Blocks**:
  - Represented by `X` on the grid.
  - Used to obstruct the opponent's path.
- **Empty Cells**: Represented by `.` on the grid.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Action Phase**: Choose to either move your piece or place a block.
     - **Move**: Move your piece to an adjacent empty cell.
     - **Block**: Place a block on any empty cell not adjacent to either player's piece.
- **Movement Rules**:
  - A piece can move to any of the eight adjacent cells (including diagonals) as long as the cell is empty.
  - A piece cannot move onto a cell occupied by a block or the opponent's piece.
- **Block Placement Rules**:
  - Blocks can be placed on any empty cell not adjacent (including diagonally) to either player's piece.
  - Blocks remain on the grid for the duration of the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Winning the Game**:
  - **Victory by Crossing**: Be the first to move your piece onto any cell of the opponent's starting row.
  - **Victory by Blockade**: If the opponent cannot make any valid moves on their turn, you win.
- **Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw.
- **Valid Moves**:
  - A move is valid if it adheres to the movement rules and results in the piece occupying a new cell.
  - If a player has no valid moves, they lose the game.
- **Blocked Cells**:
  - Once a block is placed, it cannot be moved or removed.
  - Blocks serve as permanent obstacles for both players.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The winner is the player who either reaches the opponent's starting row first or successfully blocks the opponent's possible moves.
