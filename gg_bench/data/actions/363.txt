In the game implementation, the action space indices (0-9) are mapped to moves by adding 1 to the index value to correspond with the selectable numbers in the game (1-10). Therefore, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to action index 9 which corresponds to selecting the number 10.
