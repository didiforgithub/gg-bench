In the gym environment, the action space indices map directly to the integers from 0 to the maximum initial total \( T \) (in this example, 30), representing potential moves. However, only indices that correspond to proper divisors of \( T \) (excluding 1 and \( T \) itself) are valid moves, representing the numbers a player can choose to subtract from the current shared total. Consequently, while the action space includes all integers up to the maximum \( T \), the valid actions in a given state depend on the current proper divisors of \( T \).
