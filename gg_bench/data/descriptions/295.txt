### **Rules and Mechanics**

#### **Actions Explanation**

1. **Attack**

   - **Effect**: Deals **2 damage** to the opponent's HP.
   - **Conditions**:
     - If the opponent is **Defending**, the attack deals **no damage**.
     - If the opponent is **Healing**, the attack deals **double damage** (**4 damage**).

2. **Defend**

   - **Effect**: Blocks incoming damage from the opponent's next attack.
   - **Conditions**:
     - While defending, the player cannot perform an **Attack** on their following turn.
     - On the turn after defending, the player may choose to **Defend** again or **Heal**, but not **Attack**.

3. **Heal**

   - **Effect**: Restores **1 HP** to the player, up to the maximum of **10 HP**.
   - **Conditions**:
     - If the opponent chooses to **Attack** while the player is healing, the player takes **double damage** (**4 damage**), unless the player was **Defending**.
     - Healing does not affect the opponent.

#### **Additional Rules**

- **Health Points Boundaries**:
  - A player's HP cannot exceed **10**.
  - If a player's HP drops to **0** or below, they lose the game.

- **Defending Mechanics**:
  - Defending only blocks damage from an **Attack**.
  - It does not prevent other effects such as the opponent **Healing**.
  - After defending, players are restricted from attacking on their next turn to prevent consecutive defenses followed by immediate attacks.

- **Double Damage**:
  - Occurs when a player **Attacks** an opponent who is **Healing**.
  - The opponent takes **4 damage** instead of **2**.

- **Turn Restrictions After Defending**:
  - A player who has just defended can only choose to **Defend** again or **Heal** on their next turn.
  - This adds a strategic component to planning future moves.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The game is won when a player reduces their opponent's HP to **0** or below through strategic use of actions.
  - The victorious player is declared the winner immediately when this condition is met.

- **Losing the Game**:
  - A player loses when their own HP is reduced to **0** or below.

- **No Draws**:
  - Since actions are resolved sequentially and HP cannot be reduced simultaneously during the same action, the game cannot end in a draw.

**Notes for Players**:

- **Defending** is useful when you expect an incoming attack, but it limits your options on the next turn.
- **Healing** can be risky if the opponent chooses to attack since it can result in double damage.
- **Attacking** is straightforward but may be ineffective if the opponent is defending.
- **Balancing Actions**: Successful players balance attacking to reduce the opponent's HP, defending to protect themselves, and healing to stay in the game.
