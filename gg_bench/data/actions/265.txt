In this game environment, the action space is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 19. These indices map to moves as follows:

- **Indices 0-9**: Each represents adding a digit (0-9) to the **left** end of the shared number.
- **Indices 10-19**: Each represents adding a digit (0-9) to the **right** end of the shared number.

The action is decoded by determining the digit as `action % 10`. The position is determined by whether the action is less than 10 (left) or 10 and above (right).
