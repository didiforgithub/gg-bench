The action space in the gym environment is a discrete set of indices that correspond to the prime numbers up to the initial starting number, `starting_N`. Each index in the action space maps directly to a specific prime from this list. When a player chooses an action (an index in this space), it indicates their choice to divide the current shared number `N` by the associated prime number. This setup ensures the actions are restricted to valid moves (dividing by prime factors of `N`) and systematically organizes potential divisor primes as selectable actions for the player.
