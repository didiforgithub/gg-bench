**Game Name:** Sum Fifteen Challenge

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of Sum Fifteen Challenge is to be the first player to reach a cumulative total sum of **exactly 15** by selecting numbers from 1 to 9. Players take turns choosing numbers, aiming to add them to their personal total without exceeding 15. 

A player **wins** by:
- Reaching a total sum of exactly 15 on their turn.

A player **loses** by:
- Exceeding a total sum of 15 on their turn.
- If all numbers from 1 to 9 have been picked and no player has reached exactly 15, the player with the highest total not exceeding 15 wins.
- In case of a tie in totals, the player who has selected **fewer numbers** wins.
- If still tied, the **second player** (the one who moved second) wins.

### **Setup**

1. **Number Pool Creation**: A shared pool containing the numbers **1 through 9** is established. Each number can only be chosen once during the game.
2. **Player Assignment**: Determine which player will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be decided randomly or by agreement.
3. **Initial Totals**: Both players start with a cumulative total sum of **0**.

### **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**: A set of integers from **1 to 9**.
  - *Representation*: In a command-line interface, this can be displayed as a list of available numbers.
- **Player Totals**: Each player maintains their own cumulative total sum.
  - *Representation*: A numerical value representing the sum of numbers a player has chosen so far.

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - The game proceeds in turns, starting with **Player 1**, followed by **Player 2**, and so on alternately.
2. **Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: The player selects an **available number** from the number pool.
   - **Update Total**: Add the chosen number to the player's cumulative total sum.
   - **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**: After updating the total, check if the player has reached **exactly 15** (win) or **exceeded 15** (loss).
3. **Progression of Turns**:
   - After a player completes their turn, the next player takes their turn following the same structure.
   - The game continues until a win or loss condition is met.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On their turn, a player must select **one** available number from the number pool.
   - The selected number is removed from the pool and cannot be chosen again by either player.
2. **Cumulative Total Sum**:
   - Each player maintains a cumulative total sum of the numbers they have selected.
   - The cumulative sum is updated each time a player selects a number.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Immediate Win**: If a player's cumulative total sum reaches **exactly 15** on their turn, they win the game immediately.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - **Immediate Loss**: If a player's cumulative total sum **exceeds 15** on their turn, they lose the game immediately.
5. **End of Number Pool**:
   - If all numbers from **1 to 9** have been selected and no player has reached exactly 15, the game proceeds to determine the winner based on totals.
6. **Determining the Winner at Game End**:
   - **Highest Total Not Exceeding 15**: The player with the highest cumulative total sum not exceeding 15 wins.
   - **Tie-Breaker**:
     - If both players have the same total, the player who selected **fewer numbers** wins.
     - If still tied, the player who moved **second** (Player 2) wins.

### **Scoring**

- There is no point-based scoring system.
- The key metric is the player's **cumulative total sum**.
- The objective is to reach a total sum of **exactly 15** without exceeding it.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Scenario 1: Player 1 Wins by Reaching 15**

- **Available Numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- **Player 1 Total**: 0
- **Player 2 Total**: 0

**Turn Progression**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **7**
   - Player 1 Total: **0 + 7 = 7**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses **8**
   - Player 2 Total: **0 + 8 = 8**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **6**
   - Player 1 Total: **7 + 6 = 13**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses **2**
   - Player 2 Total: **8 + 2 = 10**
   - Available Numbers: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses **2** (Not available, must choose from available numbers)
   - Chooses **2** => Invalid choice, number not available.
   - Corrects and chooses **2**
   - Since **2** is already chosen, must select from available numbers.
   - Chooses **2** => Invalid.
   - Realizes mistake and chooses **^5^**
   - Player 1 Total: **13 + 5 = 18**
   - Player 1 has **exceeded 15** and **loses** immediately.
   - **Player 2 wins.**

*Note*: In this case, Player 1 made an error and exceeded 15.
