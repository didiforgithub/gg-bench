# Zero Sum Game

## Objective

Be the first player to create a shared mathematical expression that evaluates to **zero**. Players build the expression collaboratively, using numbers and operators strategically to steer the total towards zero while preventing their opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

- **Numbers Available**: Digits from **1** to **9**.
- **Operators Available**: Addition (**'+'**) and Subtraction (**'-'**).
- **Initial Expression**: Starts at **0**.
- **Number Usage**: Each number from 1 to 9 can be used **only once** throughout the game.

## Game Components

- **Shared Expression**: A mathematical expression built incrementally by both players during their turns.
- **Numbers List**: A list of numbers from **1** to **9**, tracking which numbers have been used.
- **Operators**: Symbols **'+'** and **'-'** used to modify the shared expression.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their choices via the command line, and the current state of the game is displayed after each turn.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, with Player 1 starting the game.
2. **Action Sequence**:
   - **Choose an Operator**: '+' or '-'.
   - **Choose a Number**: Any unused number from **1** to **9**.
   - **Update Expression**: Append the operator and number to the shared expression.
3. **Post-Turn Update**:
   - The game displays the updated expression and the current total value.
   - The used number is removed from the list of available numbers.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Number Restrictions**:
  - Each number from **1** to **9** can be used only once in the game.
  - Once a number is used, it cannot be selected again by either player.
- **Operators**:
  - Players can use **'+'** or **'-'** on any turn, regardless of prior choices.
- **Expression Evaluation**:
  - After each turn, the shared expression is evaluated.
  - If the expression evaluates to **zero**, the player who made the last move **wins** the game.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - **Victory Condition**: Create an expression that evaluates to **zero** on your turn.
  - **Exhaustion Rule**: If all numbers are used and the expression does not equal zero, the last player who made a move **loses**, and the opponent **wins**.
- **Prohibited Actions**:
  - Players cannot skip their turn.
  - Players must choose both an operator and an unused number on each turn.
- **Strategic Considerations**:
  - Players should aim to manipulate the total towards zero.
  - Anticipate the opponent's moves and block potential winning strategies by using critical numbers.

## Scoring

- The game outcome is determined by victory or lossâ€”there is no point system.
- Players may choose to play multiple rounds and keep track of wins for extended gameplay.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Game Start

- **Shared Expression**: `0`
- **Available Numbers**: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Operator Chosen**: `+`
- **Number Chosen**: `5`
- **Expression Update**: `0 + 5`
- **Current Total**: `5`
- **Available Numbers**: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9`

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Operator Chosen**: `-`
- **Number Chosen**: `3`
- **Expression Update**: `0 + 5 - 3`
- **Current Total**: `2`
- **Available Numbers**: `1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9`

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Operator Chosen**: `+`
- **Number Chosen**: `4`
- **Expression Update**: `0 + 5 - 3 + 4`
- **Current Total**: `6`
- **Available Numbers**: `1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9`

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Operator Chosen**: `-`
- **Number Chosen**: `6`
- **Expression Update**: `0 + 5 - 3 + 4 - 6`
- **Current Total**: `0`
- **Result**: **Player 2 Wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Game Start
Shared Expression: 0
Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Player 1's Turn:
Choose an operator ('+' or '-'): +
Choose a number from available numbers: 5
Updated Expression: 0 + 5
Current Total: 5
Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Player 2's Turn:
Choose an operator ('+' or '-'): -
Choose a number from available numbers: 3
Updated Expression: 0 + 5 - 3
Current Total: 2
Available Numbers: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Player 1's Turn:
Choose an operator ('+' or '-'): +
Choose a number from available numbers: 4
Updated Expression: 0 + 5 - 3 + 4
Current Total: 6
Available Numbers: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9

Player 2's Turn:
Choose an operator ('+' or '-'): -
Choose a number from available numbers: 6
Updated Expression: 0 + 5 - 3 + 4 - 6
Current Total: 0

Player 2 has created an expression that evaluates to zero.
Player 2 Wins!
```

## Strategies and Tips

- **Number Selection**: Choose numbers that can help you manipulate the total towards zero or prevent your opponent from doing so.
- **Operator Use**: Consider how adding or subtracting a number will impact the total. Sometimes adding a negative value may be more beneficial.
- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Keep track of unused numbers and anticipate how your opponent might use them.
- **Control Key Numbers**: Utilize critical numbers that could allow your opponent to win if left available.
- **Plan Ahead**: Think multiple moves in advance to set up a path to zero while blocking your opponent.

## Game Flow Summary

1. **Initiate Game**: Start with a shared expression of 0 and a list of numbers from 1 to 9.
2. **Alternate Turns**: Players take turns selecting an operator and a number, updating the expression.
3. **Update and Evaluate**: After each turn, update the expression and evaluate the total.
4. **Check for Victory**:
   - If the total is zero, the last player to move wins.
   - If all numbers are used and the total is not zero, the last player to move loses.
5. **End Game**: Declare the winner and reset for another round if desired.
