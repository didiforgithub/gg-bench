# Switch Battle Rule Book

---

## Objective

**Switch Battle** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a sequence of switches. The primary goal is to be the first player to change all switches to the "on" position (represented by `1`). Players achieve victory by strategically flipping switches according to the game rules to reach the winning pattern before their opponent.

---

## Setup

- **Switch Sequence**: The game consists of a sequence of **7 switches**, arranged in order from left to right, labeled positions **1** through **7**.
- **Initial State**: At the start of the game, all switches are set to **`0`** (off). The switch sequence appears as:

  ```
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  ```

- **Player Assignment**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Switches**: Each switch has two states:
  - **`0`**: Representing the "off" state.
  - **`1`**: Representing the "on" state.
- **Switch Sequence**: The linear arrangement of the 7 switches that players will interact with during the game.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input commands to flip switches using a text-based interface. The game displays the current state of the switches after each move.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Actions Per Turn**: On each turn, a player must perform **one** of the following actions:
  - **Flip a Single Switch**: Change the state of any one switch.
  - **Flip Two Adjacent Switches**: Change the states of two switches that are next to each other.
- **Input Format**:
  - For flipping a single switch: `flip [position]` (e.g., `flip 4`).
  - For flipping two adjacent switches: `flip [position1] [position2]` (positions must be adjacent, e.g., `flip 3 4`).

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Switch Flipping Rules**:
   - **Flipping a Single Switch**:
     - The player selects any switch from positions **1** to **7**.
     - The switch changes state: `0` becomes `1`, and `1` becomes `0`.
   - **Flipping Two Adjacent Switches**:
     - The player selects a pair of switches that are next to each other (e.g., switches 2 and 3).
     - Valid starting positions for flipping two adjacent switches are **1** to **6**.
     - Both switches change state simultaneously.
2. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins immediately upon changing all switches to the "on" position:
     ```
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     ```
3. **No Draws**:
   - The game continues until one player achieves the winning condition.
4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts an invalid action (e.g., flipping non-adjacent switches or selecting out-of-range positions), they are prompted to make a valid move without penalty.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves and plan your strategy several turns in advance.
- **Control the Center**: Flipping switches in the center offers more flexibility due to the higher number of adjacent pairs.
- **Force Moves**: Set up the game state to limit your opponent's options or force them into making moves that benefit you.
- **Balance**: Mix between flipping single switches and pairs to keep your opponent guessing.
