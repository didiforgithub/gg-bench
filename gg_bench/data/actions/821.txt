In the game, the action space indices directly correspond to the positions on the number line. With the number line ranging from 1 to 11, each index in the action space represents one of these positions, offset by 1 (i.e., position 1 maps to index 0, position 2 maps to index 1, and so on, up to position 11 mapping to index 10). Therefore, each index in the action space denotes where a player can place or move their marker on the board, with only unoccupied positions and adjacent moves being valid based on the game's rules.
