# Sum Battle

## Objective

Be the first player to reach a cumulative total of **exactly 50** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool. The goal is to reach the target sum before your opponent without exceeding it.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players compete against each other.
- **Starting Conditions**:
  - Both players begin with a **cumulative total of 0**.
  - A **shared pool of numbers** from **1** to **9** is available for selection. Each number can be selected multiple times throughout the game.

## Game Components

- **Shared Numbers Pool**:
  - Numbers available: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**.
  - Each number can be selected by either player on their turn, subject to the selection rules.
- **Cumulative Totals**:
  - Each player maintains their own cumulative total sum, starting at **0**.
  - The cumulative total increases as players add numbers from the shared pool during their turns.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players take turns alternately.
  - **Player 1** starts the game.
- **Actions During a Turn**:
  - Select a valid number from the shared pool according to the selection rules.
  - Add the selected number to your cumulative total.
  - Announce the selected number and your new cumulative total.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection Rules

1. **Valid Numbers**:
   - On your turn, you may choose any number between **1** and **9** from the shared pool.
   - Numbers can be selected multiple times throughout the game.

2. **Restriction Based on Opponent's Last Move**:
   - **You cannot select the same number** that your opponent selected on their **immediately previous turn**.
   - **You cannot select numbers that are adjacent** to your opponent's last selected number. Adjacent numbers are those that differ by **Â±1**.
     - For example, if your opponent selected **5** on their last turn:
       - You **cannot** select **4**, **5**, or **6** on your turn.

### Cumulative Total Rules

1. **Adding to Total**:
   - After selecting a valid number, add it to your cumulative total.
   - Keep track of your cumulative total throughout the game.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a cumulative total of **exactly 50** wins.

3. **Exceeding the Target**:
   - If a player's cumulative total **exceeds 50**, they **immediately lose** the game.

4. **No Valid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid selection on their turn due to the number selection rules, they **lose the game**.

## Scoring

- **Winning**:
  - The player who reaches a cumulative total of **exactly 50** first **wins the game**.
- **Losing**:
  - A player loses if:
    - Their cumulative total **exceeds 50**.
    - They **cannot make a valid move** on their turn.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**:
  - Try to select numbers that limit your opponent's options on their next turn.
  - For example, selecting a middle number like **5** restricts your opponent from selecting **4**, **5**, or **6**.

- **Plan Your Cumulative Total**:
  - Keep an eye on both your and your opponent's cumulative totals.
  - Aim to reach numbers that set you up to reach 50 in future turns without exceeding it.

- **Avoid Exceeding 50**:
  - Be cautious when your cumulative total is close to 50.
  - Consider the possible numbers you can select and ensure they don't push you over the target.

- **Force a Win**:
  - If possible, maneuver the game to a state where you can reach exactly 50 on your next turn, regardless of your opponent's move.

## Game Flow Summary

4. **End the Game**:
   - Declare the winner and conclude the game when a win/loss condition is met.
