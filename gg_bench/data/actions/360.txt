In the Gridlock Showdown game implemented as a Gym environment, the 5x5 grid is flattened into a single-dimensional action space with indices ranging from 0 to 24, representing each cell of the grid. The mapping works by treating the grid as a continuous list, where the action index `a` corresponds to position `(row, col)` on the grid, calculated as follows:

- **Row**: `a // 5` (integer division by 5)
- **Col**: `a % 5` (remainder when divided by 5)

This mapping allows each action index to specify a unique cell in the 5x5 grid, where players can attempt to place their markers.
