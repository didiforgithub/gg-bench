In the action space of the game, the indices correspond to moves as follows:

- Indices 0 to 4 map to probing actions, allowing the player to guess Key Numbers 1 through 5. Specifically, index 0 corresponds to guessing the number 1, index 1 to guessing 2, and so on up to index 4 for guessing 5.
- Index 5 represents the unlock action, allowing the player to attempt unlocking the opponent's lock if the Key Number has been correctly identified.
