The action space indices in the game map to actions as follows:

- **Movement actions** (indices 0 to 3):
  - `0`: Move runner up.
  - `1`: Move runner down.
  - `2`: Move runner left.
  - `3`: Move runner right.

- **Barrier placement actions** (indices 4 to 28):
  - Indices `4` to `28` correspond to placing a barrier at grid positions `A1` to `E5`.
  - Calculate the specific position by treating index `n` as follows:
    - Row: `(n - 4) // 5`
    - Column: `(n - 4) % 5`

Thus, index `4` places a barrier at `A1`, index `5` at `A2`, continuing until index `28` at `E5`.
