The action space indices (0 to 8) in the gym environment correspond to the selection of numbers from the number pool (1 to 9) in the game. Each index directly maps to the number one greater than the index, i.e., index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 mapping to the number 9. This mapping facilitates the player's choice of a number from the available pool during their turn.
