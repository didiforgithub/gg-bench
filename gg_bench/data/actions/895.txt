In the provided gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, which means it includes indices from `0` to `8`. Each index corresponds to a specific number in the range from `2` to `10`. Specifically, index `0` maps to the number `2`, index `1` maps to the number `3`, up through index `8`, which maps to the number `10`. Essentially, each index represents choosing the number that is `index + 2` from the available numbers in the game.
