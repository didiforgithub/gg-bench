The action space consists of 15 discrete actions:

- **Flip Actions** (indices 0-4): Each action corresponds to flipping a bit at a specific position in the binary string:
  - Action 0: Flip bit at position 1 (index 0)
  - Action 1: Flip bit at position 2 (index 1)
  - Action 2: Flip bit at position 3 (index 2)
  - Action 3: Flip bit at position 4 (index 3)
  - Action 4: Flip bit at position 5 (index 4)

- **Swap Actions** (indices 5-14): Each action corresponds to swapping two bits at specified positions, based on predefined swap pairs:
  - Action 5: Swap bits at positions 1 and 2
  - Action 6: Swap bits at positions 1 and 3
  - Action 7: Swap bits at positions 1 and 4
  - Action 8: Swap bits at positions 1 and 5
  - Action 9: Swap bits at positions 2 and 3
  - Action 10: Swap bits at positions 2 and 4
  - Action 11: Swap bits at positions 2 and 5
  - Action 12: Swap bits at positions 3 and 4
  - Action 13: Swap bits at positions 3 and 5
  - Action 14: Swap bits at positions 4 and 5
