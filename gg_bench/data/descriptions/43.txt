# Factor Duel

## Objective

Be the last player able to select a number from the shared pool according to the game rules. Victory is achieved by successfully forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: A shared pool containing all the integers from **2** to **50**, inclusive.
- **Player Sets**: Each player starts with an empty set of "captured" numbers.
- **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**:
  - Contains the numbers **2** through **50**.
  - Numbers are removed from the pool as they are selected.

- **Player's Captured Numbers**:
  - Each player maintains their own set of captured numbers.
  - These sets start empty and grow as players select numbers.

- **Numbers (2-50)**:
  - Each number has its inherent mathematical properties.
  - Numbers can have factors (divisors) other than 1 and themselves.
  - Prime numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.) have no divisors other than 1 and themselves.

---

## Turns

- Play proceeds in alternating turns between the two players.
- **On Your Turn**:
  1. **Select a Number**:
     - Choose a number from the shared pool that adheres to the selection rules.
  2. **Update Sets**:
     - Add the selected number to your set of captured numbers.
     - Remove the selected number from the shared pool.

- **Turn Progression**:
  - Continue alternating turns until a player cannot make a valid selection on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection Rules

- **Valid Selection**:
  - On your turn, you must select a number from the shared pool that is **coprime** with **all** numbers in your own captured set.
  - **Coprime**: Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is **1** (they share no common factors other than 1).

- **Invalid Selection**:
  - You **cannot** select a number that shares any common factors greater than 1 with any number in your captured set.

### Game Progression

- **Captured Numbers**:
  - Keep track of the numbers you have captured.
  - These numbers determine which numbers you can select in future turns.

- **End of Game**:
  - If a player cannot select any valid number on their turn (no numbers in the pool are coprime with their captured set), they **lose**.
  - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Strategic Blocking**:
  - Players can choose numbers not only to advance their own position but also to limit the options available to their opponent in future turns.

- **Mathematical Strategy**:
  - Understanding prime numbers and common factors is crucial.
  - Capturing numbers with certain factors can block large groups of numbers for your opponent.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The game does not use a point-based scoring system.
  - Victory is binary: you **win** if your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

#### Initial Setup

- **Number Pool**: 2 to 50.
- **Player 1 Set**: Empty.
- **Player 2 Set**: Empty.

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Selection**: Chooses **13** (a prime number).
- **Reason**: Starting with a prime gives maximum flexibility.
- **Updated Sets**:
  - **Player 1 Set**: {13}
  - **Number Pool**: Numbers 2-50 excluding 13.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Selection**: Chooses **12**.
- **Reason**: 12 has factors of 2 and 3; Player 2 plans to limit Player 1's options by controlling these factors.
- **Updated Sets**:
  - **Player 2 Set**: {12}
  - **Number Pool**: Numbers 2-50 excluding 12 and 13.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Selection**: Chooses **17**.
- **Reason**: Must select a number coprime with 13; 17 is coprime with 13.
- **Updated Sets**:
  - **Player 1 Set**: {13, 17}
  - **Number Pool**: Excludes 12, 13, 17.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Selection**: Chooses **9**.
- **Reason**: 9 shares a factor with 12 (both divisible by 3); acceptable since the rule checks for common factors with their own set, not the opponent's.
- **Updated Sets**:
  - **Player 2 Set**: {12, 9}
  - **Number Pool**: Excludes 9, 12, 13, 17.

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Selection**: Chooses **29**.
- **Reason**: 29 is coprime with both 13 and 17.
- **Updated Sets**:
  - **Player 1 Set**: {13, 17, 29}
  - **Number Pool**: Excludes 9, 12, 13, 17, 29.

#### Turn 6: Player 2

- **Selection**: Attempts to choose **6**.
- **Validity Check**:
  - Factors of 6: 2 and 3.
  - **Invalid**: 6 shares common factors with both 12 and 9 in Player 2's set.
- **Alternative Selection**: Chooses **25**.
- **Reason**: Factors of 25 are 5 and 5. 25 is coprime with both 12 and 9.
- **Updated Sets**:
  - **Player 2 Set**: {12, 9, 25}
  - **Number Pool**: Excludes 9, 12, 13, 17, 25, 29.

#### Gameplay Continues...

- Players continue selecting numbers according to the rules.
- Eventually, one player will be unable to make a valid selection.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
Player 1's Turn
Your Captured Numbers: []
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 50]
Enter a number to capture: 13

Player 2's Turn
Your Captured Numbers: []
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 50] (excluding 13)
Enter a number to capture: 12

Player 1's Turn
Your Captured Numbers: [13]
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 50] (excluding 12, 13)
Enter a number to capture: 17
...

(Player attempts an invalid move)

Player 2's Turn
Your Captured Numbers: [12, 9, 25]
Available Numbers: [remaining numbers]
Enter a number to capture: 6
Invalid selection! 6 shares a common factor with your captured numbers.
Enter a valid number to capture: (Player cannot make a valid move)
Player 2 cannot make a valid move.
Player 1 wins!
```

## Tips for Strategic Play

- **Prioritize Prime Numbers**: They are only divisible by 1 and themselves, making future selections easier.
- **Block Opponent's Options**: Capture numbers with common factors to restrict your opponent's future selections.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate which numbers will remain in the pool and how your selections affect future moves.
