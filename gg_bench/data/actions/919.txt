In the game's environment, the action space is a discrete set with three indices: 0, 1, and 2. These indices correspond to moving the player's token forward by 1, 2, or 3 positions, respectively, on the board. Specifically, the index 0 maps to a move of 1 position, index 1 maps to a move of 2 positions, and index 2 maps to a move of 3 positions.
