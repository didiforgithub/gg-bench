In the Sum Challenge game, the action space indices ranging from 0 to 8 correspond to selecting the numbers 1 to 9 from the central pool. Specifically, action index 0 maps to the selection of the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, and so on, up to index 8 which maps to the number 9. Each action directly translates to picking the associated number from the pool, provided it is still available.
