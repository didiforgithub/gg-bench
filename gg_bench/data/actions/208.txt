The action space in the provided environment maps indices 0 to 7 to the allowed divisors 2 to 9. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to divisor 2, index 1 to divisor 3, and so on, up to index 7, which corresponds to divisor 9. This mapping allows players to select a divisor based on the action index during gameplay.
