The action space of the game is represented by a discrete space of size 10, where each action corresponds to a unique pair of indices in the shared pool (representing the numbers to be merged). The mapping from action indices to index pairs is as follows:

- Action 0: Merge numbers at indices `(0, 1)`
- Action 1: Merge numbers at indices `(0, 2)`
- Action 2: Merge numbers at indices `(0, 3)`
- Action 3: Merge numbers at indices `(0, 4)`
- Action 4: Merge numbers at indices `(1, 2)`
- Action 5: Merge numbers at indices `(1, 3)`
- Action 6: Merge numbers at indices `(1, 4)`
- Action 7: Merge numbers at indices `(2, 3)`
- Action 8: Merge numbers at indices `(2, 4)`
- Action 9: Merge numbers at indices `(3, 4)`

Each action index selects two numbers from the pool to perform a merge, as per the predefined index pairs.
