# GridLock Rule Book

## Objective

**GridLock** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a 4x4 grid. The primary goal is to be the first player to block your opponent from making a legal move. A player wins by strategically placing their markers to limit the opponent's options, ultimately forcing them into a position where they cannot place a marker according to the game rules.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A 4x4 grid (4 rows and 4 columns) is used as the playing field.
2. **Markers**:
   - **Player 1** uses the marker `'X'`.
   - **Player 2** uses the marker `'O'`.
3. **Starting the Game**:
   - Decide who will be Player 1 and Player 2 (e.g., flip a coin).
   - The grid is initially empty with all cells unmarked.

## Game Components

- **The Grid**:
  - Represents the playing area with 16 cells arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns.
  - Cells are identified by their row and column numbers (e.g., Row 1, Column 1).
- **Markers**:
  - `'X'` for Player 1.
  - `'O'` for Player 2.
  - Markers are placed on the grid to occupy cells.
- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Players input their moves by specifying the row and column numbers.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Structure of a Turn**:
  1. The player is informed of the last move made.
  2. The player is presented with available moves based on the rules.
  3. The player selects a cell by entering the row and column numbers.
  4. The game updates the grid and checks for a win condition.
- **Progression of Turns**:
  - The game continues with players taking turns until a player wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. First Turn

- **Player 1** can place their `'X'` marker on **any empty cell** on the grid.

### 2. Subsequent Turns

- Starting from **Player 2's turn**, each player must place their marker adjacent to the last marker placed on the grid.
- **Adjacency Rules**:
  - A cell is considered adjacent if it is **directly above, below, to the left, or to the right** of the last placed marker.
  - Diagonal cells are **not** considered adjacent.
- **Valid Moves**:
  - The selected cell must be empty.
  - The cell must be adjacent to the last move.

### 3. Placing Markers

- On their turn, players input the coordinates (row and column) of the cell where they wish to place their marker.
- If the input is invalid (e.g., cell is not adjacent or already occupied), the player is prompted to enter a different cell.

### 4. Winning the Game

- A player wins if their opponent **cannot make a legal move** on their turn.
- The game ends immediately when a player has no valid moves according to the adjacency rules.

### 5. Example of Adjacency

- If the last marker was placed at **Row 2, Column 2**, the adjacent cells are:
  - **Row 1, Column 2**
  - **Row 3, Column 2**
  - **Row 2, Column 1**
  - **Row 2, Column 3**
- The next player must choose one of these cells if they are empty.

## Scoring

- **Win**: Achieved by blocking the opponent from making a legal move.
- **Loss**: Occurs when a player cannot make a legal move on their turn.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; there is always a winner.

### Sample Game Play

**Initial Grid**:

```
[ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ]

**Turn 1**: Player 1's move

- **Move**: Places `'X'` at **Row 2, Column 2**.
- **Grid**:

  ```
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][X][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  ```

**Turn 2**: Player 2's move

- **Last Move**: Row 2, Column 2
- **Available Moves**:
  - Row 1, Column 2
  - Row 3, Column 2
  - Row 2, Column 1
  - Row 2, Column 3
- **Move**: Places `'O'` at **Row 2, Column 3**.
- **Grid**:

  ```
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][X][O][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  ```

**Turn 3**: Player 1's move

- **Last Move**: Row 2, Column 3
- **Available Moves**:
  - Row 1, Column 3
  - Row 3, Column 3
  - Row 2, Column 2 (occupied)
  - Row 2, Column 4
- **Move**: Places `'X'` at **Row 3, Column 3**.
- **Grid**:

  ```
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][X][O][ ]
  [ ][ ][X][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  ```

**Turn 4**: Player 2's move

- **Last Move**: Row 3, Column 3
- **Available Moves**:
  - Row 2, Column 3 (occupied)
  - Row 4, Column 3
  - Row 3, Column 2
  - Row 3, Column 4
- **Move**: Places `'O'` at **Row 4, Column 3**.
- **Grid**:

  ```
  [ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][X][O][ ]
  [ ][ ][X][ ]
  [ ][ ][O][ ]
  ```

**Game Continues** until a player cannot make a legal move.

### Sample Command-Line Interaction

**Player 1's Turn**:

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Enter the row number (1-4): 2
Enter the column number (1-4): 2
```

**Player 2's Turn**:

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Last move was at Row 2, Column 2.
Available adjacent cells:
- Row 1, Column 2
- Row 3, Column 2
- Row 2, Column 1
- Row 2, Column 3
Enter the row number (1-4): 2
Enter the column number (1-4): 3
```

**Player 1's Next Turn**:

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Last move was at Row 2, Column 3.
Available adjacent cells:
- Row 1, Column 3
- Row 3, Column 3
- Row 2, Column 2 (occupied)
- Row 2, Column 4
Enter the row number (1-4): 3
Enter the column number (1-4): 3
```

**Example of Winning Scenario**:

Suppose the grid is almost full, and it's **Player 2's turn**:

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Last move was at Row 4, Column 2.
Available adjacent cells:
- Row 3, Column 2 (occupied)
- Row 4, Column 1 (occupied)
- Row 4, Column 3 (occupied)
No legal moves available. You cannot make a move.
Player 1 wins!
```

**Final Grid**:

```
[O][X][O][X]
[X][X][O][O]
[O][X][X][X]
[O][O][X][X]
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Control the Center**: Placing your markers near the center increases your options for adjacency.
- **Block Opponent's Moves**: Try to limit the available adjacent cells for your opponent.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and plan to cut off their paths.
- **Edge Strategy**: Using the edges and corners wisely can trap your opponent.
