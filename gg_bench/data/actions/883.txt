In the game, the action space consists of 25 discrete indices, each corresponding to a specific cell in the 5x5 grid. The action index `a` maps to grid coordinates `(row, column)` as follows: `row = a // 5` and `column = a % 5`. This means action index 0 represents the top-left cell `(0, 0)`, action index 1 represents the cell to the right `(0, 1)`, continuing in row-major order, and action index 24 represents the bottom-right cell `(4, 4)`.
