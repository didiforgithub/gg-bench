In the provided gym environment for the game Max Digit Zero, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, meaning it consists of 10 discrete actions corresponding to the digits 0 through 9. The action space indices (0-9) directly map to the possible moves a player can make by subtracting a digit from the current number N. However, in a valid move, the action must match the largest digit in N, ensuring only the largest digit can be subtracted. The environment enforces this by checking if the chosen action equals the largest digit in N, thus aligning the action index with game moves.
