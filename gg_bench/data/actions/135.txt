In the "Number Line Battle" gym environment, the action space indices (0-19) correspond directly to the positions on the number line (1-20). Each index represents an unclaimed number that a player can choose to mark on their turn. An action of `i` indicates that the player is selecting the number `i+1` on the number line to claim it with their marker.
