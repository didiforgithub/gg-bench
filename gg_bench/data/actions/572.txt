In this game environment, the action space indices map to game moves as follows:
- **0 to 3**: Correspond to adding numbers **1 to 4** to the player's stack. Specifically, index 0 adds number 1, index 1 adds number 2, index 2 adds number 3, and index 3 adds number 4.
- **4**: Represents the action of attacking the opponent's stack, given the conditions for a valid attack are met (the top numbers of both stacks must match).
