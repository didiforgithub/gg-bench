In the gym environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 19, corresponding to the integers -10 to -1 and +1 to +10 in the game's number pool. Each index maps to a specific number, with indices 0 to 9 representing the numbers -10 to -1, respectively, and indices 10 to 19 representing the numbers +1 to +10, respectively. This mapping allows players to select an action index to choose the corresponding number from the available number pool, which is then added to the cumulative total during their turn.
