The action space consists of 20 discrete actions where each index corresponds directly to selecting a number from the game's number list (1 to 20). Specifically, an action index `i` represents selecting the number `i + 1`. For example, action index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `1`, and action index `19` corresponds to selecting the number `20`. This mapping allows each player to choose a number during their turn using a zero-indexed action that aligns with the game's 1-based list of numbers.
