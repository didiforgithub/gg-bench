## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection:**
   - On your turn, select any integer **N** such that **1 ≤ N ≤ 10**.
   
2. **Restriction on Number Used Against You:**
   - You **cannot** select the same number that your opponent used against you on their last turn.
   - If you do, your turn is forfeited, and no points are subtracted from your opponent's score.

3. **Score Reduction:**
   - The valid chosen number is subtracted from your opponent's current score.

4. **Tracking Last Number Used:**
   - Keep track of the last valid number used against you for reference.

5. **Forfeited Turns:**
   - If a turn is forfeited due to an invalid number choice, the opponent's score remains unchanged.

6. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your opponent's score reaches **zero or below** after you subtract the number, you win the game.

---

## Scoring

- **Score Tracking:**
  - Both players' scores are displayed at the end of each turn.

- **Score Calculation Example:**
  - If Player 1 subtracts **7** from Player 2's score:
    - Player 2's new score = Previous Score - 7

- **No Negative Subtractions:**
  - Scores can go negative; the game ends immediately if a score is zero or negative.

## Strategy Tips

- **Avoid Common Numbers:**
  - Anticipate which numbers your opponent might want to use and use them to limit their options.

- **Vary Your Choices:**
  - Changing your number selections can prevent your opponent from predicting your moves.

- **Monitor Scores:**
  - Keep an eye on both scores to plan when to use higher or lower numbers strategically.

- **Force Forfeits:**
  - By using numbers you think your opponent might choose next, you increase the chance they might forfeit a turn.
