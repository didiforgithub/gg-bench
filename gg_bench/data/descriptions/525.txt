## **Setup**

1. **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid is used as the game board.
   
2. **Starting Positions**:
   - **Player A**: Starts at the **top-left corner** of the grid (position **(0, 0)**).
   - **Player B**: Starts at the **bottom-right corner** of the grid (position **(4, 4)**).

3. **Treasure Placement**:
   - The **Treasure** is placed at the **center cell** of the grid (position **(2, 2)**).

4. **Traps**:
   - Each player has **3 Traps** at their disposal at the beginning of the game.

---

## **Game Components**

1. **Game Board (5x5 Grid)**:
   - Cells are identified by their coordinates `(x, y)`, where `x` is the column number (0 to 4) and `y` is the row number (0 to 4).

2. **Player Pieces**:
   - **Player A's piece** is represented by `'A'`.
   - **Player B's piece** is represented by `'B'`.

3. **Treasure**:
   - Represented by `'T'` and initially placed at `(2, 2)`.

4. **Traps**:
   - Represented by `'X'`.
   - Can be placed on any empty cell that doesn't contain a player or the Treasure.

5. **Empty Cells**:
   - Represented by `' '` (a space).

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with **Player A**.

2. **Actions per Turn**:
   - On each turn, a player must choose **one** of the following actions:
     - **Move** their piece to an adjacent cell.
     - **Place a Trap** on the grid (if they have Traps remaining).

3. **Movement Rules**:
   - A player can move their piece to an **adjacent cell** that is:
     - Directly **above**, **below**, **to the left**, or **to the right** of their current position.
     - **Within the bounds** of the grid.
     - **Not occupied** by a Trap, the opponent's piece, or outside the grid.

4. **Trap Placement Rules**:
   - A Trap can be placed on **any empty cell** that:
     - Does not currently contain the **Treasure**.
     - Does not contain **either player's piece**.
     - Is **within the bounds** of the grid.
   - Players have a limited number of Traps (**3 per player**).

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Collecting the Treasure**:
   - A player **collects the Treasure** by moving their piece onto the cell containing the Treasure `(2, 2)`.
   - Once collected:
     - The Treasure is **removed from the board**.
     - The player is now **carrying the Treasure**.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - To win, a player must:
     - **Collect the Treasure**.
     - **Return to their starting position** while carrying the Treasure.

3. **Traps Effects**:
   - If a player moves onto a cell containing a Trap:
     - The player is **'trapped'** and must **skip their next turn**.
     - The Trap remains on the board after activation.
   - A player **cannot collect the Treasure** or **win the game** while trapped.
   - If a trapped player is carrying the Treasure:
     - They **continue to carry the Treasure** after the trap effect ends.

4. **Movement Restrictions**:
   - Players **cannot move onto**:
     - A cell **occupied by the opponent**.
     - A cell **outside the grid bounds**.

5. **Trap Limitations**:
   - Players have a **maximum of 3 Traps** for the entire game.
   - Traps **cannot be moved or removed** once placed.

6. **Simultaneous Actions**:
   - If both players move onto the Treasure cell at the same time:
     - The player whose turn it is **collects the Treasure**.
     - The other player remains on their current cell.

7. **Skipping Turns**:
   - A player **must skip their turn** if:
     - They are trapped (due to landing on a Trap in the previous turn).
     - **No possible moves** are available (this is unlikely due to the grid size unless completely surrounded by Traps).

---

## **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to **collect the Treasure** and **return to their starting position** wins the game.

- **Draws**:
  - There are **no draw mechanisms** in the game. The game continues until one player wins.
