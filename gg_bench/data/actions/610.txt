In the provided gym environment code for the game "Line Duel," the action space indices (0 to 4) map directly to the move card values (1 to 5). Specifically, an action space index of 0 corresponds to playing the move card value 1, an index of 1 corresponds to move card value 2, and so on, until an index of 4 corresponds to move card value 5. This mapping means that the player selects an index from the action space to play the respective move card in the game.
