In the game, the action space indices map to moves as follows:  
- Index 0 corresponds to "Light Attack (LA)" which decreases the opponent's barrier by 2.
- Index 1 corresponds to "Heavy Attack (HA)" which decreases the opponent's barrier by 3 (only when the player's barrier is above 3).
- Index 2 corresponds to "Fortify (F)" which increases the player's own barrier by 1, up to a maximum of 10.
