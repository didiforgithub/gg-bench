In the "Capture Squares" game, the action space indices (0 to 15) directly map to the 4x4 grid cells in row-major order. Each index corresponds to a specific cell where the player can claim or capture:

- Index 0 corresponds to the top-left cell (1,1).
- Index 1 corresponds to the cell (1,2).
- ...
- Index 3 corresponds to the top-right cell (1,4).
- Index 4 corresponds to the cell (2,1).
- ...
- Index 15 corresponds to the bottom-right cell (4,4).

This linear mapping allows each action to specify a move by indicating which grid cell to target.
