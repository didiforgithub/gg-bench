The action space in the game employs an index system that maps to combinations of movement and lock placement. There are 4 possible movement directions (up, down, left, right), each associated with an index range. For each movement direction, there are 5 corresponding options for lock placement: one for each orthogonal direction and one for skipping lock placement. This results in 4 movement directions * 5 lock placements = 20 total actions.

The mapping is as follows:
- Actions 0-4: Move Up, with lock placement options Up, Down, Left, Right, or Skip.
- Actions 5-9: Move Down, with lock placement options Up, Down, Left, Right, or Skip.
- Actions 10-14: Move Left, with lock placement options Up, Down, Left, Right, or Skip.
- Actions 15-19: Move Right, with lock placement options Up, Down, Left, Right, or Skip.

Each action index corresponds to a unique combination of movement and lock placement directives, with the mapping reflecting these combinations.
