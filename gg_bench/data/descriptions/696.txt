# Quantum Capture: A Strategic Two-Player Game

## Objective

**Primary Goal**: Be the first player to capture all of your opponent's quantum particles by predicting their hidden states.

Players achieve victory by successfully deducing and capturing their opponent's particles through strategic guesses and logical reasoning. A player wins when the opponent has no particles remaining on the board.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: A 5x5 grid representing quantum space.
2. **Quantum Particles**: Each player has 5 unique particles labeled with the numbers 1 to 5.
3. **Particle Placement**:
   - Players take turns secretly placing their particles on the board.
   - Particles can be placed on any unoccupied grid cell.
   - The placement and labels of the particles are hidden from the opponent.

## Game Components

- **Game Board (5x5 Grid)**:
  - Represents the quantum space where particles exist.
  - Each cell can hold one particle.
- **Quantum Particles**:
  - **Appearance**: Represented by their labels (1-5), but labels are hidden from the opponent.
  - **Functionality**: Used to occupy spaces and engage in quantum scans.
  - **Unique Attributes**: Each particle has a "quantum state" (its label) known only to the owning player.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Quantum Scan** (Optional):
     - The player may choose to scan a 3x3 area of the grid.
     - The scan reveals if any opponent particles are within that area but not their exact positions.
  2. **Particle Guess**:
     - The player selects a specific grid cell to guess the presence and label of an opponent's particle.
     - Example Command: `guess B3 4`
  3. **Resolution**:
     - If the guess is correct (both position and label), the opponent's particle is captured and removed from the board.
     - If incorrect, nothing happens.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement and Actions

- **Quantum Scan**:
  - Costs no points but limited to one per turn.
  - Reveals only the presence (yes/no) of opponent particles within the selected 3x3 area.
- **Particle Guessing**:
  - The core mechanic for capturing particles.
  - Requires specifying both the grid cell and the particle's label.

### Special Abilities

- **Quantum Entanglement**:
  - Once per game, a player can entangle two of their particles.
  - When one entangled particle is guessed correctly, the opponent must reveal the location of the other entangled particle.
  - Command: `entangle 2 5`

### Interactions Between Components

- Particles cannot move once placed.
- Players must use logic and memory to keep track of scans and guesses.
- Misleading the opponent about scans or guesses is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **Capturing Particles**:
  - Each captured particle is worth 1 point.
  - The goal is to capture all 5 of the opponent's particles.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to capture all opponent particles wins.
  - No draws are possible due to the finite number of particles and the capture mechanics.

## Examples

### Sample Turn

**Player 1's Turn**:

1. **Quantum Scan**:
   - Command: `scan C2`
   - Outcome: "Opponent particles detected in the scanned area." (if any opponent particles are within the 3x3 grid centered at C2)
2. **Particle Guess**:
   - Command: `guess D3 3`
   - Outcome:
     - If correct: "Hit! Opponent's particle 3 at D3 captured."
     - If incorrect: "Miss. No opponent particle 3 at D3."

### Sample Game Play

**Initial Setup**:

- Both players secretly place their particles on the grid.
- Example, Player 1 places particle 1 at A1, 2 at B2, etc.

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Scans at C3.
   - Gets a positive result.
   - Guesses D3 4.
   - Misses.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Scans at B2.
   - Gets a positive result.
   - Guesses A1 1.
   - Hit! Captures Player 1's particle 1.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Decides to use Quantum Entanglement on particles 2 and 5.
   - Guesses B2 2.
   - Hit! Captures Player 2's particle 2.
   - Player 2 must reveal the location of the entangled particle (per entanglement rules).

**Game Continues** until one player captures all opponent particles.

---

By engaging in strategic scanning and guessing, players use deductive reasoning to locate and capture opponent particles. The addition of the Quantum Entanglement mechanic adds depth and a unique twist to the gameplay, ensuring that skilled players who can effectively use these tools will consistently outperform less experienced opponents.
