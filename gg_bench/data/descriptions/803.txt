# Number Tower Duel

## Objective

Build a tower of numbered blocks by strategically placing them according to specific rules. The primary goal is to outmaneuver your opponent by being the last player able to place a block on the tower. The player who successfully places a block when their opponent cannot is declared the winner. There are no draws in this gameâ€”play continues until one player wins.

## Setup

1. **Game Blocks:** A shared set of numbered blocks from **1** to **9**.
2. **Tower Base:** Start with an empty tower space where blocks will be stacked.
3. **Player Order:** Decide which player goes first (Player 1) and which goes second (Player 2). This can be determined by a coin toss or mutual agreement.
4. **Starting Conditions:** All blocks numbered **1** to **9** are available and placed in a shared pool accessible to both players.

## Game Components

- **Numbered Blocks (1-9):** Each block has a unique number from **1** to **9**.
  - **Appearance:** In the command-line interface, blocks are represented by their numerical value.
  - **Functionality:** Blocks are used to build the tower and must be placed according to placement rules.
  - **Unique Attributes:** Each block can only be used once; once placed, it cannot be moved or reused.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Block Selection:** On their turn, a player selects one available block from the shared pool.
  2. **Placement Attempt:** The player attempts to place the block on top of the tower according to the placement rules.
  3. **Turn Completion:** The turn ends after the player places a block or cannot make a valid move.

- **Order of Actions:**
  - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
  - Each turn consists of selecting and attempting to place one block.

- **Player Actions During Turn:**
  - **Valid Action:** Select and place a block according to the rules.
  - **Invalid Action:** If no valid moves are available, the player must pass, and the game ends.

- **Turn Progression:**
  - The game continues with players alternating turns until a winner is determined.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Placement Rules

1. **First Block Placement:**
   - The first player can place any number from **1** to **9** as the base of the tower.

2. **Subsequent Block Placement:**
   - A block can be placed on top of the tower only if it meets **one** of the following conditions with the block immediately below it:
     - **Divisor Rule:** The number is a **divisor** of the block below.
     - **Multiple Rule:** The number is a **multiple** of the block below.

3. **Available Blocks:**
   - Only blocks not yet used (remaining in the shared pool) can be selected.

4. **Valid Moves:**
   - If a player has at least one block that can legally be placed on the tower, they must place it.
   - If a player has no valid moves (no blocks can be placed according to the rules), they lose the game.

### Special Conditions

- **No Skipping Turns:** Players cannot skip their turn if a valid move is available.
- **No Rearranging:** Once a block is placed, it cannot be moved or removed.
- **Winning the Game:** The game is won by the player who places a block when their opponent cannot.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Progress:**
  - The height of the tower represents the progress.
  - No numerical score is kept; the game is won by strategic placement leading to the opponent's inability to move.

- **Victory Conditions:**
  - **Win:** A player wins if their opponent cannot place a block on their turn.
  - **Loss:** A player loses if they cannot place a block on their turn.
  - **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player wins.
