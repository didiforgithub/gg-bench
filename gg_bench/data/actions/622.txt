In the code, the action space is defined as a discrete set ranging from 0 to `max_n - 2`, representing possible divisor indices. Each action index corresponds to a specific proper divisor by mapping it to `divisor = action + 2`. This means action index 0 corresponds to divisor 2, index 1 to divisor 3, and so on, up to index `max_n - 2` corresponding to divisor `max_n`.
