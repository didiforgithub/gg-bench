# Divisor Duel

## Objective

**Be the first player to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move** by strategically subtracting proper divisors from a shared number.

---

## Setup

- **Current Number**: Begin with a shared positive integer as the starting point. The recommended starting number is **60**, but players may agree on any positive integer greater than 2.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who takes the first turn through mutual agreement or a random method like a coin toss.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (Current Number)**: The central number that both players manipulate during the game.
- **Proper Divisors**: All positive integers that divide the Current Number exactly, **excluding** 1 and the number itself.
  - *Example*: Proper divisors of 60 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **On Each Turn**:
  1. **Identify** the proper divisors of the Current Number.
  2. **Choose** one proper divisor to subtract from the Current Number.
  3. **Announce** the chosen divisor and the new Current Number after subtraction.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Valid Moves

- **Subtraction Requirement**: On your turn, you must subtract a proper divisor of the Current Number.
- **Single Subtraction**: Only one proper divisor can be subtracted per turn.
- **Proper Divisors Only**: You cannot subtract 1 or the Current Number itself.

### 2. Updating the Current Number

- After subtraction, the result becomes the new Current Number for the next turn.
  - *Example*: If the Current Number is 60 and you subtract 15, the new Current Number is 45.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **No Valid Divisors**: If a player cannot subtract a proper divisor on their turn (because none exist), they lose the game.
- **Forcing a Loss**: Strategically reduce the Current Number to a prime number or 1 on your opponent's turn.

### 4. Additional Rules

- **Mandatory Moves**: If at least one proper divisor exists, you must make a move.
- **Accurate Calculations**: Incorrect identification of proper divisors results in losing your turn (optional rule for added challenge).
- **No Reversals**: Once a move is made and the Current Number announced, it cannot be changed.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Winning the game occurs by forcing your opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **No Points System**: The game focuses on winning individual rounds. Players may keep track of wins over multiple games if desired.

## Examples

### Example 1: Gameplay Walkthrough

**Starting Current Number**: 60

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 60**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30.
- **Choice**: Subtract 15.
- **Calculation**: 60 - 15 = **45**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 15. The new Current Number is 45."

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 45**: 3, 5, 9, 15.
- **Choice**: Subtract 15.
- **Calculation**: 45 - 15 = **30**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 15. The new Current Number is 30."

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 30**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15.
- **Choice**: Subtract 15.
- **Calculation**: 30 - 15 = **15**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 15. The new Current Number is 15."

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 15**: 3, 5.
- **Choice**: Subtract 5.
- **Calculation**: 15 - 5 = **10**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 5. The new Current Number is 10."

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 10**: 2, 5.
- **Choice**: Subtract 2.
- **Calculation**: 10 - 2 = **8**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 2. The new Current Number is 8."

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 8**: 2, 4.
- **Choice**: Subtract 4.
- **Calculation**: 8 - 4 = **4**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 4. The new Current Number is 4."

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 4**: 2.
- **Choice**: Subtract 2.
- **Calculation**: 4 - 2 = **2**.
- **Announcement**: "I subtract 2. The new Current Number is 2."

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Proper Divisors of 2**: None (since 2 is prime).
- **Outcome**: Player 2 cannot make a valid move and **loses the game**.
- **Player 1 Wins!**

### Example 2: Command-Line Interaction

**Starting Current Number**: 30

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Current Number: 30
Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter the divisor you want to subtract: 15

You subtracted 15.
New Current Number is 15.
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Current Number: 15
Proper Divisors: 3, 5
Enter the divisor you want to subtract: 5

You subtracted 5.
New Current Number is 10.
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Current Number: 10
Proper Divisors: 2, 5
Enter the divisor you want to subtract: 5

You subtracted 5.
New Current Number is 5.
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Player 2, it's your turn.
Current Number: 5
Proper Divisors: None

No valid moves left. You lose!
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Force Prime Numbers**: Aim to reduce the Current Number to a prime number on your opponent's turn, leaving them without any proper divisors to subtract.
- **Analyze Ahead**: Consider the possible results of your move and how it will affect your opponent's options.
- **Control the Game Flow**: Subtract larger proper divisors when beneficial to limit the range of your opponent's moves.
