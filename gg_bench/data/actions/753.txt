In the game, the action space indices map directly to the available prime numbers used for attacks. Each index in the action space corresponds to a specific prime number from the list `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`, with index `0` representing the prime number `2`, index `1` representing `3`, and so on, up to index `7` representing the prime number `19`. This allows players to select their attack by choosing the corresponding index, which is then converted to its respective prime number for gameplay.
