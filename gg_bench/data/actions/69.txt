In the given gym environment for the Grid Runner game, the action space is represented by indices from 0 to 24, corresponding to a flattened version of the 5x5 grid. Each action index can be mapped to a specific cell on the grid using the formulas:

- Row: `action // 5`
- Column: `action % 5`

This means that an action of index 0 targets the top-left corner (0,0), index 1 targets (0,1), continuing row by row, with index 24 targeting the bottom-right corner (4,4). This mapping allows each action index to uniquely represent a move to a specific position on the grid.
