# Double or Add One: Game Rule Book

## Objective

**Double or Add One** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly 20** by manipulating a shared number starting from **1**. On each turn, a player can choose to either **double** the current number or **add one** to it. The player who reaches **20** on their turn wins the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with the shared number set to **1**.
- **Players**: Two players are required. Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer value that both players manipulate during the game.
  - **Initial Value**: Starts at **1**.
  - **Range**: Must always be a positive integer not exceeding **20**.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their choices via the command line.
  - **Inputs**: Players will enter **1** to add one or **2** to double the current number.
  - **Outputs**: The game displays the current number and prompts players for input.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Current Number**: The game shows the current shared number.
  2. **Player's Choice**: The active player chooses an action:
     - Enter **1** to **add one** to the current number.
     - Enter **2** to **double** the current number.
  3. **Invalid Moves**: If both actions result in a number exceeding **20**, the player loses their turn.
  4. **Update**: The current number is updated based on the player's action.
  5. **Check for Win**: If the current number is **exactly 20**, the active player wins.
  6. **Next Turn**: If no one has won, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Actions per Turn**: On their turn, players must choose one of the following:
  - **Add One**:
    - Increment the current number by **1**.
  - **Double**:
    - Multiply the current number by **2**.
- **Number Limit**: The current number must **not exceed 20** after an action.
  - If an action would cause the number to exceed **20**, that action is invalid.
  - If both actions are invalid, the player loses their turn.
- **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach **exactly 20** on their turn **wins**.
- **Losing a Turn**:
  - If a player cannot make a valid move, their turn is skipped.
  - The other player then attempts to reach **20** on their turn.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: Reach exactly **20** to win the game.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use a points system; it's a win/loss outcome based on achieving the objective.
