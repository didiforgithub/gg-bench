# Number Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to accumulate **exactly 50 points** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool and choosing whether to add or multiply them with your current score.

---

## Setup

1. **Shared Number Pool**: Create a pool containing the numbers **1** through **10**, with each number appearing **twice**. This results in a total of **20 number tokens** in the pool.

2. **Player Scores**: Both players start with a score of **0**.

---

## Game Components

- **Number Tokens**:
  - **Numbers**: Integers from **1** to **10**.
  - **Quantity**: Each number appears **twice** in the pool.
  - **Representation**: Can be displayed as a list or array in the command-line interface.
  
- **Player Scores**:
  - **Initial Score**: Both players start at **0**.
  - **Tracking**: Scores are updated and displayed after each turn.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.
   
2. **Actions per Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: Choose any available number from the shared pool.
   - **Choose an Operation**: Decide to **add** or **multiply** the selected number with your current score.
   - **Update Score**: Calculate and update your score based on the chosen operation.
   - **Remove Number**: The selected number is removed from the pool and cannot be used again.

3. **Turn Progression**: After a player completes their turn, the next player proceeds with their turn following the same steps.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Selecting Numbers

- **Availability**: You may select any number that remains in the pool.
- **Removal**: Once a number is selected, it is removed from the pool for the remainder of the game.

### Operations

1. **Addition**:
   - **Formula**: `New Score = Current Score + Selected Number`
   - **Usage**: Can always be used, regardless of current score.

2. **Multiplication**:
   - **Formula**: `New Score = Current Score × Selected Number`
   - **Special Considerations**:
     - **Zero Score**: If your current score is **0**, multiplying will result in a score of **0**.
     - **Strategic Use**: Multiplication can rapidly increase your score but may risk overshooting the target.

### Scoring Rules

- **Exact Target**: The goal is to reach a score of **exactly 50**.
- **Overshooting**:
  - If your score exceeds **50**, your score is reset to **0**.
  - Example: Current Score = 45, Selected Number = 6, Operation = Add; New Score = 51 ➔ Score resets to **0**.
- **Score Reset**:
  - Occurs **immediately** upon exceeding 50.
  - The game continues with your new score of **0** on your next turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to reach a score of **exactly 50 points** wins the game.
- **No Draws**: There are no draw conditions; the game continues until one player wins.

### Additional Rules

- **Unavailable Operations**: You must be able to perform the chosen operation without breaking game rules (e.g., not exceeding 50 without score reset if that is your strategy).
- **End of Number Pool**:
  - If all numbers are used and no player has reached 50, the player **closest to 50 without exceeding it** wins.
  - If both players have the same score, the **last player to have taken a turn loses**.

## Scoring Example

- **Player Scores**: Track each player's score after every turn.
- **Display Format**: Show current scores and remaining numbers in the pool.

## Strategy Tips

- **Early Multiplication**: Multiplying when your score is low may not be beneficial due to minimal gain.
