The action space indices in the gym environment correspond to the possible choices of multipliers a player can use on their turn. Specifically, the action space is defined as `Discrete(8)`, which means there are 8 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 7. These indices map to the multiplier options from 2 to 9 inclusively. Therefore, the mapping is as follows: action index 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2, index 1 corresponds to a multiplier of 3, and so on, up to index 7, which corresponds to a multiplier of 9. This relationship is implemented by adding 2 to the action index, resulting in the actual multiplier used in the game.
