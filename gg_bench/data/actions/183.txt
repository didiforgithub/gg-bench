In the provided gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with size equal to the number of available numbers (from 2 to 50), which is 49. Each action corresponds to selecting a number from this range where the action index maps to the position of the number in the ordered list `[2, 3, 4, ..., 50]`. For example, action index `0` represents selecting the number `2`, index `1` represents selecting the number `3`, and so on up to index `48`, which represents selecting the number `50`. Thus, the action taken refers to the index of the number in this sequential list of available numbers.
