# Prime Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Prime Duel** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to make the running total reach **exactly a prime number** by adding available numbers from a specified range. Players must use logic and strategic planning to outmaneuver their opponent and secure victory.

## Setup

1. **Starting Total**: The game begins with a running total of **0**.
2. **Number Pool**: All integers from **1 to 50** are available for selection.
3. **First Player**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by mutual agreement or a random method).

## Game Components

- **Running Total**: A cumulative sum that both players can see. It starts at **0** and increases as players add numbers to it.
- **Number Pool (1-50)**: A list of integers from **1 to 50**. Each number can be used only **once** during the game.
- **Prime Numbers**: Recognized prime numbers within the possible range of totals (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, ..., 97).

## Turns

- Players take **alternate turns**.
- On each turn, a player:
  1. **Chooses a Number**: Selects an unused number from the number pool.
  2. **Updates the Total**: Adds the chosen number to the running total.
  
- The game provides feedback after each turn, displaying:
  - The **chosen number**.
  - The **new running total**.
  - The **remaining available numbers**.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Numbers**:
   - Players may choose **any available number** from **1 to 50** on their turn.
   - Each number can be selected **only once**. Once a number is used, it is **removed** from the number pool.
   
2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The objective is to be the player whose move causes the running total to reach **exactly a prime number**.
   - If a player's move results in the running total being a prime number, that player **wins immediately**.
   
3. **Avoiding Overshooting**:
   - If the running total reaches or exceeds **100** without hitting a prime number, the **last player to make a move loses**.
   
4. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players **must** select numbers that do not cause the running total to exceed **100**.
   - If a player has no valid moves (all remaining numbers would cause the total to exceed 100), that player **loses**.
   
5. **Prime Number Recognition**:
   - Players should be familiar with prime numbers up to **100**.
   - The game may provide a list of prime numbers if agreed upon before the game starts.

## Scoring

- The game uses a **win/loss** scoring system.
- **Winner**: The player who first reaches a prime number total.
- **Loser**: The opposing player.
- Players may keep track of wins over multiple games to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting the Game**

- Running Total: **0**
- Available Numbers: **1-50**

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- Chooses **13**.
- Updates Running Total: **0 + 13 = 13**.
- **13** is a prime number.
- **Player 1 wins the game!**

---

**Alternate Scenario**

**Player 1's Turn**

- Chooses **4**.
- Updates Running Total: **0 + 4 = 4**.
- **4** is not a prime number.

**Player 2's Turn**

- Chooses **6**.
- Updates Running Total: **4 + 6 = 10**.
- **10** is not a prime number.

**Player 1's Turn**

- Chooses **7**.
- Updates Running Total: **10 + 7 = 17**.
- **17** is a prime number.
- **Player 1 wins the game!**

---

**Game with Strategic Depth**

**Player 1's Turn**

- Chooses **8**.
- Running Total: **0 + 8 = 8**.

**Player 2's Turn**

- Chooses **9**.
- Running Total: **8 + 9 = 17**.
- **17** is a prime number.
- **Player 2 wins the game!**

**Analysis**: Player 1 may have failed to prevent Player 2 from reaching a prime total.

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Think about which numbers can lead your opponent to a prime total and avoid setting them up.
- **Prime Awareness**: Be familiar with prime numbers between 2 and 100 to make informed decisions.
- **Number Elimination**: Deny your opponent key numbers that could easily create a prime total.
- **Running Total Control**: Manage the running total to steer the game towards numbers advantageous to you.
