The action space indices in the environment map directly to the numbers 1 to 9 used in the game. Specifically, an action index `i` (ranging from 0 to 8) corresponds to selecting the number `i + 1`. Thus, action index 0 maps to the number 1, action index 1 maps to the number 2, and so forth, up to action index 8, which maps to the number 9. This mapping allows players to use action indices to select available numbers and make moves according to the rules of the game.
