In the gym environment for the "Bid and Build" game, the action space is defined as `spaces.MultiDiscrete([11, 11])`, indicating that each player's bid can range from 0 to 10 points. The indices in the action space directly map to the bid amounts each player chooses in a round. Specifically, the first index corresponds to Player 1's bid, and the second index corresponds to Player 2's bid. For instance, an action array `[3, 2]` means Player 1 bids 3 points and Player 2 bids 2 points.
