The action space indices range from 0 to 44, representing all possible moves, which are derived from the combination of selecting one of the 15 available tokens and placing it on one of the 3 stacks. Specifically, each action index `a` corresponds to placing token `(a // 3) + 1` (ranging from token 1 to token 15) onto stack `(a % 3)` (ranging from stack 0 to stack 2). This mapping covers all combinations of choosing a token from the available pool and placing it onto one of the player's three stacks.
