# Match Six

## Objective

Be the first player to create a sequence where any three consecutive numbers sum to **exactly 6** without exceeding it. The player who adds a number that causes the sum of the last three numbers in the sequence to be exactly 6 **wins** the game. If the sum exceeds 6, the player who caused this **loses**.

---

## Setup

- **Sequence Initialization**: The game begins with an empty shared sequence of numbers.
- **Player Assignment**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Determine who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.
- **Starting Conditions**: Both players have full visibility of the current sequence at all times.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Sequence**: A list that both players contribute to, which holds the sequence of numbers chosen during the game.
- **Numbers**: Integers between **1** and **3** (inclusive). These are the only valid inputs a player can choose on their turn.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played entirely through text input and output in a command-line environment.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Player Actions**:
  1. **Input**: On your turn, enter a number between **1** and **3**.
  2. **Validation**: Ensure the input is valid (an integer between 1 and 3).
  3. **Update Sequence**: Add the chosen number to the end of the shared sequence.
  4. **Check for Win/Loss**: Evaluate the sum of the last three numbers in the sequence if it contains at least three numbers.
- **Progression**: The game continues in this manner until a win or loss condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**: On each turn, players must choose an integer between **1** and **3** (inclusive) to add to the sequence.
2. **Updating the Sequence**: The chosen number is appended to the end of the shared sequence.
3. **Win Condition**:
   - If **after your turn**, the sum of the **last three numbers** in the sequence is **exactly 6**, you **win** the game.
4. **Loss Condition**:
   - If the sum of the last three numbers is **greater than 6**, you **lose** the game immediately.
5. **No Action on Less Than Three Numbers**:
   - If the sequence contains **less than three numbers**, no sum calculation is performed.
6. **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw. It will continue until one player wins or loses according to the above conditions.
7. **Strategic Play**:
   - Players must plan ahead to avoid setting up the opponent for a win on their next turn.
   - Be cautious of the existing sequence and anticipate potential sums.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by causing the sum of the last three numbers to be **exactly 6** on your turn.
- **Defeat**: Occurs if you cause the sum of the last three numbers to exceed 6 on your turn.
- **No Point System**: The game is won or lost per match; there is no cumulative scoring.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1**: Chooses **2**.
   - Sequence: [2]
   - No sum calculation (less than three numbers).
2. **Player 2**: Chooses **2**.
   - Sequence: [2, 2]
   - No sum calculation.
3. **Player 1**: Chooses **2**.
   - Sequence: [2, 2, 2]
   - Sum of last three numbers: 2 + 2 + 2 = **6**
   - **Player 1 wins!**

### Example 2

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1**: Chooses **1**.
   - Sequence: [1]
   - No sum calculation.
2. **Player 2**: Chooses **3**.
   - Sequence: [1, 3]
   - No sum calculation.
3. **Player 1**: Chooses **3**.
   - Sequence: [1, 3, 3]
   - Sum of last three numbers: 1 + 3 + 3 = **7**
   - Sum exceeds 6.
   - **Player 1 loses!**

### Example 3

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1**: Chooses **1**.
   - Sequence: [1]
2. **Player 2**: Chooses **1**.
   - Sequence: [1, 1]
3. **Player 1**: Chooses **2**.
   - Sequence: [1, 1, 2]
   - Sum: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 (game continues).
4. **Player 2**: Chooses **3**.
   - Sequence: [1, 1, 2, 3]
   - Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
   - **Player 2 wins!**

## Strategic Tips

- **Avoid Immediate Loss**: Never choose a number that would cause the sum of the last three numbers to exceed 6.
- **Plan Ahead**: Pay attention to the current sequence to avoid setting up your opponent for a win.
- **Force Opponent's Hand**: Try to play in a way that limits your opponent's safe options, potentially forcing them into a losing move.
- **Balance**: Mix your number choices to keep the sequence sums unpredictable.
