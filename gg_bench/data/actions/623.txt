In the action space, each index from 0 to 124 corresponds to a unique 3-digit code where each digit ranges from 1 to 5. To map an index to a code, the index is divided by 25 to determine the first digit, then the remainder is divided by 5 to find the second digit, and the remaining value gives the third digit. Each computed digit is adjusted by adding 1 since digits range from 1 to 5. Thus, index "action" maps to a guess: `(action // 25 + 1, (action % 25) // 5 + 1, (action % 5) + 1)`.
