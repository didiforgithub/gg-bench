In the given gym environment for the "Factor Frenzy" game, the action space is defined as discrete values from 0 to 48. Each action index corresponds to selecting a number from the Number Pool, specifically mapping index `i` to the number `i + 2`. For example, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 2, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 3, and so on, up to index 48, which corresponds to selecting the number 50. This mapping provides a direct link between the action indices and the numbers in the game's Number Pool.
