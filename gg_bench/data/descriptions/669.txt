# Factor Frenzy

**Objective**

The primary goal of **Factor Frenzy** is to be the player who reduces the shared number **N** to **1** by strategically dividing it by its prime factors. The player who successfully reduces **N** to **1** on their turn wins the game.

---

**Setup**

1. **Initial Number Selection**: Choose a starting positive integer **N** greater than **1**. For a quick game, it's recommended to select **N** between **30** and **100**.
   
2. **Determine the First Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., flip a coin, or the younger player starts).

---

**Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that both players will manipulate during the game.

- **Prime Factors**: Prime numbers that exactly divide **N** without leaving a remainder.

---

**Turns**

Players alternate turns throughout the game.

- **On Your Turn**:
  1. **Identify Valid Moves**: List all prime factors of the current **N**.
  2. **Choose a Prime Factor**: Select one prime factor from your list.
  3. **Divide**: Divide **N** by the chosen prime factor.
  4. **Update N**: The result becomes the new **N** for the next turn.
  5. **Announce Move**: Clearly state the chosen prime factor and the new value of **N**.

- **Turn Progression**:
  - After completing your turn, the play passes to your opponent.

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Prime Factors**:
   - Only **prime numbers** that are exact divisors of **N** can be used.
   - **1** is not considered a prime number and cannot be used.
   
2. **Division Rules**:
   - The division must result in an integer greater than or equal to **1**.
   - If **N** is a prime number, you may divide it by itself to reduce **N** to **1**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces **N** to exactly **1** on their turn **wins**.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (no prime factors other than **1**), they **lose**.

4. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players must make a move if a valid prime factor exists.
   - If no valid moves are available, the player loses their turn, and the opponent wins.

5. **No Repeating Moves**:
   - There are no restrictions on using the same prime factors multiple times in different turns, as long as they are valid for the current **N**.

---

**Scoring**

- **Winning**: The player who reduces **N** to **1** wins the game.
- **No Points System**: The game does not track points; victory is based solely on achieving the objective.

**Examples**

### Example 1: Starting with N = 60

**Initial N**: 60

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 60**: 2, 3, 5
   - **Choice**: Divide by **2**
   - **Calculation**: 60 ÷ 2 = **30**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 2. N is now 30."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 30**: 2, 3, 5
   - **Choice**: Divide by **5**
   - **Calculation**: 30 ÷ 5 = **6**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 5. N is now 6."

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 6**: 2, 3
   - **Choice**: Divide by **3**
   - **Calculation**: 6 ÷ 3 = **2**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 3. N is now 2."

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 2**: 2
   - **Choice**: Divide by **2**
   - **Calculation**: 2 ÷ 2 = **1**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 2. N is now 1."
   - **Result**: Player 2 **wins** the game.

### Example 2: Starting with N = 45

**Initial N**: 45

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 45**: 3, 5
   - **Choice**: Divide by **5**
   - **Calculation**: 45 ÷ 5 = **9**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 5. N is now 9."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 9**: 3
   - **Choice**: Divide by **3**
   - **Calculation**: 9 ÷ 3 = **3**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 3. N is now 3."

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Prime Factors of 3**: 3
   - **Choice**: Divide by **3**
   - **Calculation**: 3 ÷ 3 = **1**
   - **Announce**: "I divide by 3. N is now 1."
   - **Result**: Player 1 **wins** the game.

**Strategy Tips**

- **Prime Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with prime numbers to quickly identify valid moves.
  
- **Control the Game Flow**: Try to force your opponent into a position where they have fewer options.

- **Anticipate Moves**: Think ahead to predict your opponent's potential moves based on the factors of the resulting numbers.

**Example Command-Line Interaction**

**Game Start**

```
Welcome to Factor Frenzy!
Enter the starting number (N > 1): 45
Player 1 will start the game.

Current N: 45
Player 1, it's your turn.
Available prime factors: 3, 5
Enter your chosen prime factor: 5
N is now 9.

Current N: 9
Player 2, it's your turn.
Available prime factors: 3
Enter your chosen prime factor: 3
N is now 3.

Current N: 3
Player 1, it's your turn.
Available prime factors: 3
Enter your chosen prime factor: 3
N is now 1.

N has been reduced to 1.
Player 1 wins the game!
