## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:

   - On your turn, you must select one available number from the shared list.
   - You cannot skip your turn or select more than one number.

2. **Calculating Points**:

   - The points earned are equal to the number of **unique prime factors** of the selected number.
   - **Example**:
     - Selecting **6** (prime factors 2 and 3) earns **2 points**.
     - Selecting **12** (prime factors 2 and 3) also earns **2 points** (since 2 and 3 are the unique primes).
     - Selecting **30** (prime factors 2, 3, and 5) earns **3 points**.

3. **Prime Factors**:

   - Only **unique prime factors** are counted for points.
   - Repeated prime factors are not counted multiple times.
     - **Example**: Selecting **8** (prime factors 2, 2, 2) earns **1 point** because 2 is the only unique prime factor.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - The first player to reach or exceed **10 points** immediately wins the game.
   - If both players reach or exceed 10 points in the same round, the player with the higher score wins.
   - If scores are tied after both players have reached or exceeded 10 points, the game continues until the tie is broken in subsequent turns.

5. **Game End Condition**:

   - The game ends when a player wins by reaching the target score.
   - If all numbers are exhausted without any player reaching 10 points, the player with the higher score wins.
   - There are no draws; play continues until a winner is determined.

## **Scoring**

- **Scoring Formula**:

  ```
  Points Earned = Number of Unique Prime Factors of Selected Number
  ```

- **Examples**:

  - **Number 2**: Prime factors [2]; Points = 1
  - **Number 15**: Prime factors [3, 5]; Points = 2
  - **Number 28**: Prime factors [2, 2, 7]; Points = 2
  - **Number 18**: Prime factors [2, 3, 3]; Points = 2
  - **Number 30**: Prime factors [2, 3, 5]; Points = 3

- **Prime Factors Reference**:

  - Use a prime factorization method or reference table to determine the unique prime factors of numbers.

## **Strategy Tips**

- **Aim for High Factor Numbers**: Select numbers with more unique prime factors to earn more points per turn.

- **Block Opponent**: Be aware of high-value numbers remaining and consider selecting them to prevent your opponent from gaining those points.

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of the numbers your opponent might select next and adjust your strategy accordingly.

- **Efficient Scoring**: Sometimes selecting two medium-value numbers over two turns can be better than waiting for a high-value number that might be taken by your opponent.
