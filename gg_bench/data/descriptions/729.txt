# Binary Battle Rule Book

## Objective

**Binary Battle** is a two-player turn-based game where each player aims to be the first to match a secret 5-bit binary target number. By strategically toggling bits in their own binary number, players receive feedback to guide their next move. Victory is achieved when a player's binary number exactly matches the secret target number.

## Setup

1. **Secret Target Number Generation:**
   - At the start of the game, a random 5-bit binary number is generated as the secret target number (e.g., `01101`). This number remains constant throughout the game and is unknown to both players.
2. **Initial Binary Numbers:**
   - Both players begin with their own binary number set to `00000`.
3. **Player Designation:**
   - Players decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

## Game Components

- **Secret Target Number:**
  - A randomly generated 5-bit binary number (e.g., `01101`), representing a number between 0 and 31 in decimal.
  - Hidden from both players; only feedback about their own binary number relative to the target is provided.
  
- **Player Binary Numbers:**
  - Each player maintains their own 5-bit binary number, starting at `00000`.
  - The binary number consists of five bits, labeled from **Bit 1** to **Bit 5**, from left to right.

    ```
    Bit Positions:  [1][2][3][4][5]
                     0  0  0  0  0   (Initial State)
    ```

- **Bit Positions:**
  - **Bit 1:** Leftmost bit (highest value).
  - **Bit 5:** Rightmost bit (lowest value).

- **Actions:**
  - Players can toggle bits in their binary number (change a bit from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`).

## Turns

### Turn Structure

- Players alternate turns, starting with the designated first player.
- On a player's turn:
  1. **Select a Bit to Toggle:**
     - The player chooses one bit position (1 to 5) to toggle in their binary number.
     - Toggling changes the bit's value:
       - If the bit is `0`, it becomes `1`.
       - If the bit is `1`, it becomes `0`.
  2. **Update Binary Number:**
     - The player's binary number is updated to reflect the toggled bit.
  3. **Receive Feedback:**
     - The game provides feedback indicating whether the player's updated binary number is:
       - **Equal to the target number:** The player wins the game.
       - **Less than the target number:** The player continues playing.
       - **Greater than the target number:** The player continues playing.
  4. **End Turn:**
     - The turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

### Example of a Turn

- **Player Action:**
  - Player chooses to toggle **Bit 3**.
- **Before Toggling:**
  - Player's binary number: `01000` (`8` in decimal).
- **After Toggling:**
  - New binary number: `01100` (`12` in decimal).
- **Feedback:**
  - Game says: "Your number is less than the target."

## Rules and Mechanics

### Toggling Bits

- **Valid Actions:**
  - Players may only toggle one bit per turn.
  - Bit positions are numbered 1 through 5, from left to right.
- **Bit Position Values:**
  - Each bit position represents a value based on its position:

    | Bit Position | Decimal Value |
    |--------------|---------------|
    |      1       |       16      |
    |      2       |        8      |
    |      3       |        4      |
    |      4       |        2      |
    |      5       |        1      |

- **Calculating Binary Number Value:**
  - Sum the values of all bits set to `1`.

### Feedback Mechanics

- After each turn, feedback is provided to the player who just moved.
- **Possible Feedback Messages:**
  - **"Your number matches the target. You win!"**
    - The player's binary number exactly matches the secret target number.
  - **"Your number is less than the target."**
    - The player's binary number value is numerically less than the target number.
  - **"Your number is greater than the target."**
    - The player's binary number value is numerically greater than the target number.
- **No Additional Information:**
  - Players receive no further clues about the target number or the opponent's number.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:**
  - A player wins immediately upon their binary number matching the secret target number after their turn.
- **Simultaneous Victory:**
  - If both players reach the target number on the same number of turns (e.g., Player 1 on Turn 5 and Player 2 on Turn 5), the player who achieved the match on their own turn is declared the winner.

### Other Rules

- **No Skipping Turns:**
  - Players must take their turn when it comes; there's no option to pass.
- **Game Integrity:**
  - Players should not attempt to view or deduce the secret target number except through the allowed game mechanics.
- **Command-Line Interaction:**
  - All game actions and feedback are performed through command-line inputs and outputs.

## Scoring

- **No Point Tracking:**
  - The game does not use a point system.
- **Victory Determination:**
  - The outcome is determined solely by matching the secret target number.
- **Optional Match Play:**
  - Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.
