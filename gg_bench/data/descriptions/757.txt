# Prime Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach a cumulative total that is a **prime number greater than 50** without exceeding 60. Achieve this before your opponent to win the game.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players (Player A and Player B).
- **Starting Total**: Both players begin with a cumulative total of **0**.
- **First Turn**: Decide randomly which player takes the first turn.
- **Score Tracking**: Prepare a method to track each player's cumulative total (paper, calculator, or digital display).

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: Integers from **1** to **10** (inclusive).
  - Each number can be selected multiple times throughout the game.
- **Cumulative Total**: The sum of numbers a player has selected during the game.
  - Starts at **0** for each player.
- **Turn Indicator**: An indicator to show which player's turn it is (optional but helpful in a command-line interface).

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Number Selection**: The active player selects a number from the number pool.
  2. **Validation**: Ensure the selected number is allowed (not restricted based on the previous move).
  3. **Update Total**: Add the selected number to the player's cumulative total.
  4. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**: Determine if the game has been won or lost.
  5. **Next Turn**: Pass the turn to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection

- On your turn, **choose an integer between 1 and 10** (inclusive) to add to your cumulative total.
- **Restriction**: You **cannot select the same number** that your opponent selected on their **immediately previous turn**.
  - Example: If Player A selects **7**, Player B cannot select **7** on their next turn.
- All numbers remain available regardless of how many times they have been selected previously.

### Cumulative Total

- **Tracking**: Keep a running total of the numbers you have selected.
- **Visibility**: Both players' cumulative totals are public knowledge.
- **Example**: If your previous total was **15** and you select **6**, your new total is **21**.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: Be the **first player** to reach a cumulative total that is:
  - A **prime number** (a number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself).
  - **Greater than 50**.
- The game ends immediately when a player meets the victory condition.

### Losing the Game

- **Overstepping**: If your cumulative total **exceeds 60**, you **lose** the game immediately.
- **Forced Loss**: If you are unable to select any number without causing your total to exceed 60, you lose.

### Tie-Breaker

- If both players exceed 60 without either reaching a prime number greater than 50:
  - The player with the **lower cumulative total** is declared the **winner**.
  - If both totals are equal, the game continues until the tie is broken under normal rules.

## Scoring

- The game does not utilize a point system.
- Victory is achieved by meeting the specified win condition.
- There are no draws; the game must end with a win or a loss.
