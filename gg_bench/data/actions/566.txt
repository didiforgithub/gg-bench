The action space in the game is defined as a discrete space with three possible actions, represented by the indices 0, 1, and 2. The mapping is as follows:
- Index 0 corresponds to the "Attack" action, which deals 3 damage to the opponent and costs 2 EP.
- Index 1 corresponds to the "Defend" action, which reduces damage from the next opponent's attack by 2 and costs 1 EP.
- Index 2 corresponds to the "Recharge" action, which restores 3 EP, up to a maximum of 10 EP.
