# Galaxy Conquest: Rule Book

## Objective

Become the first player to conquer four planets by strategically deploying your fleet of ships. Utilize your ships wisely to defeat planet defenses and outmaneuver your opponent. The player who first controls four planets claims victory, asserting dominance over the galaxy.

## Setup

1. **Game Board**: Arrange seven planets in a row, numbered from 1 to 7. These represent the planets available for conquest, each with a defense level equal to its number.

2. **Player Fleets**: Each player receives a fleet consisting of ships numbered from 1 to 7. These ships represent your attacking power and can only be used once during the game.

3. **Starting Conditions**: Decide who will take the first turn (can be determined by a coin toss or mutual agreement).

   ```
   Planets:
   [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]

   Player 1 Ships: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   Player 2 Ships: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
   ```

## Game Components

### Planets

- **Numbers**: Planets are numbered from 1 to 7.
- **Defense Level**: Each planet has a defense level equal to its number (Planet 3 has defense 3).
- **Status**: Planets can be unconquered, conquered by Player 1, or conquered by Player 2.

### Ships

- **Fleet Composition**: Each player has ships numbered from 1 to 7.
- **Power Level**: Each ship has an attack power equal to its number (Ship 5 has power 5).
- **Usage**: Ships can be used only once. Once a ship is expended, it cannot be reused.
- **Ship Status**: Ships are either available or expended.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

Players take turns in alternating order. During each turn, the active player performs the following actions:

1. **Choose a Planet to Attack**:
   - Select any unconquered planet numbered 1 to 7.
   - You cannot attack a planet already conquered by either player.

2. **Select a Ship to Deploy**:
   - Choose an available ship from your fleet.
   - Ships cannot be reused once expended.

3. **Resolve the Attack**:
   - Compare the ship's power to the planet's defense level.
     - **Successful Attack**: If the ship's power is **equal to or greater than** the planet's defense, the attack succeeds. You conquer the planet.
     - **Failed Attack**: If the ship's power is **less** than the planet's defense, the attack fails. The planet remains unconquered.

4. **Update Game Status**:
   - Mark the ship used as expended.
   - If the attack was successful, mark the planet as conquered by you.

### Turn Progression

- After completing your turn, the next player takes their turn following the same structure.
- The game continues with players alternating turns until one player conquers four planets.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Attacking Planets

- **Selecting Planets**: You may only attack unconquered planets.
- **Ship Deployment**: You must choose an available ship from your fleet to attack.
- **Attack Resolution**:
  - **Success**: If your ship's power ≥ planet's defense.
  - **Failure**: If your ship's power < planet's defense.

### Conquering Planets

- **Conquest**: Upon a successful attack, you conquer the planet.
- **Planet Control**:
  - Conquered planets cannot be attacked again.
  - Control of a planet does not change once conquered.

### Ship Management

- **Single Use**: Ships can only be used once.
- **Strategic Use**: Plan your ship usage to maximize your chances of conquering planets.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: First player to conquer **four planets** wins the game.
- **Game End**: The game ends immediately when a player meets the victory condition.

## Scoring

- **Planet Conquest**: Each planet conquered counts as one point towards victory.
- **Winning**: No point tally is necessary beyond tracking the number of planets conquered.
- **No Draws**: With seven planets, it's impossible for players to conquer an equal number of planets, ensuring no draws.

## Strategic Tips

- **Balance Ship Usage**: Save higher-powered ships for planets with higher defenses, but don't delay too long as your opponent may claim valuable planets.
- **Predict Opponent Moves**: Anticipate which planets your opponent may target and plan accordingly.
- **Control High-Value Planets**: Conquering planets with higher numbers can deny your opponent strategic advantages.
- **Resource Management**: Remember that each ship can only be used once; use them when they will have the most impact.
