In the custom gym environment for the "Divisor Duel" game, the action space is represented as a discrete space ranging from 0 to max_N - 1. Each index corresponds to a move in the game where the action index 'a' maps to a chosen divisor by the formula 'action_value = a + 1'. The environment expects actions to be provided as indices, but they're internally adjusted to represent proper divisors of the current number N by adding 1. Thus, the proper divisor d of N used in the game corresponds to action index d - 1 in the environment. This mapping ensures alignment between the indices used in reinforcement learning algorithms and actual divisor values used to update the game state.
