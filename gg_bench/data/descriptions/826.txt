# Number Stack: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

Be the first player to create a stack of numbered tokens that sums **exactly to 15**. Utilize strategic token selection and stack management to outmaneuver your opponent and achieve the target sum before they do.

## Setup

1. **Token Pool**: Place numbered tokens from **1** to **15** face-up in a shared pool accessible to both players.
2. **Player Stacks**: Each player has **three empty stack slots**—Stack 1, Stack 2, and Stack 3—to build their stacks during the game.
3. **Starting Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (Player A or Player B).

## Game Components

### 1. Numbered Tokens

- **Quantity**: 15 tokens.
- **Values**: Each token is uniquely numbered from **1** to **15**.
- **Appearance**: Tokens can be represented by their numerical value in the command-line interface.
- **Functionality**: Tokens are selected and placed onto player stacks to accumulate sums.

### 2. Player Stacks

- **Structure**: Each player has three stacks—Stack 1, Stack 2, Stack 3.
- **Functionality**: Tokens are placed onto these stacks to build up to the target sum.
- **Attributes**:
  - **Stack Total**: The sum of all token values in a stack.
  - **Capacity**: No stack can have a total exceeding 15.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the designated first player.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - **Select a Token**: Choose one available token from the pool.
   - **Place Token on a Stack**: Place the selected token onto one of your three stacks.
3. **Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until a win condition is met or no legal moves remain.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Token Selection

- **Available Tokens**: Players can only select tokens that are currently in the pool.
- **Removal from Pool**: Once a token is selected, it is removed from the pool and cannot be selected again.

### 2. Stack Placement

- **Choosing a Stack**: The selected token must be placed on one of your own stacks.
- **Stack Limits**:
  - **Maximum Total**: A stack cannot exceed a total sum of **15**.
  - **Legal Moves**: If placing a token would cause the stack's total to exceed 15, that move is illegal for that stack.
- **Stack Management**: Players must strategically decide which stack to place a token on to reach the target sum.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to have **any one** of their stacks sum **exactly to 15** wins the game immediately.
- **No Legal Moves**: If a player has no legal moves (cannot place any remaining tokens without exceeding stack limits), they must pass their turn.

### 4. Game End Conditions

- **Win by Exact Sum**: Game ends immediately when a player achieves a stack totaling exactly 15.
- **Win by Highest Sum**:
  - If all tokens are used and no player has a stack totaling 15, the player with the **highest stack sum not exceeding 15** wins.
  - If tied, compare the next highest stacks.
  - **Tie-Breaker**: If still tied, the **second player** (Player B) is declared the winner to prevent a draw.

### 5. Mandatory Moves

- **Must Play If Able**: If a player has at least one legal move, they must take their turn.
- **Passing**: If no legal moves are available, the player passes, and the turn goes to the opponent.

## Scoring

- **No Point System**: The game does not use a point system; victory is achieved by meeting the win conditions.
- **Strategy Over Scoring**: Focus is on strategic token placement and stack management.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Setup

- **Token Pool**: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
- **Player A Stacks**: Empty
- **Player B Stacks**: Empty

#### Turn Sequence

1. **Player A's Turn**
   - **Selects Token**: 7
   - **Places on**: Stack 1
   - **Stack 1 Total**: 7
2. **Player B's Turn**
   - **Selects Token**: 8
   - **Places on**: Stack 1
   - **Stack 1 Total**: 8
3. **Player A's Turn**
   - **Selects Token**: 4
   - **Places on**: Stack 1
   - **Stack 1 Total**: 7 + 4 = 11
4. **Player B's Turn**
   - **Selects Token**: 7
   - **Places on**: Stack 1
   - **Stack 1 Total**: 8 + 7 = 15
   - **Result**: Player B wins by achieving a stack totaling exactly 15.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
Welcome to Number Stack!

Tokens in Pool: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

Player A's turn.
Available Tokens: [1-15]
Select a token: 7
Choose a stack to place the token (1-3): 1
Player A places token 7 on Stack 1 (Total: 7)

Tokens in Pool: [1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

Player B's turn.
Available Tokens: [1-6,8-15]
Select a token: 8
Choose a stack to place the token (1-3): 1
Player B places token 8 on Stack 1 (Total: 8)

Tokens in Pool: [1,2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

Player A's turn.
Available Tokens: [1-6,9-15]
Select a token: 4
Choose a stack to place the token (1-3): 1
Player A places token 4 on Stack 1 (Total: 11)

Tokens in Pool: [1,2,3,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]

Player B's turn.
Available Tokens: [1-6,9-15] (excluding already used tokens)
Select a token: 7
Choose a stack to place the token (1-3): 1
Player B places token 7 on Stack 1 (Total: 8 + 7 = 15)

Player B wins! Stack 1 sums to exactly 15.
```

## Strategic Depth and Complexity

- **Token Prioritization**: Players must decide which tokens to select to build towards 15 while also considering which tokens might benefit their opponent if left in the pool.
- **Stack Management**: With three stacks, players need to balance their efforts, deciding whether to focus on one stack or spread their tokens.
- **Anticipation**: Predicting the opponent's moves can provide a strategic advantage, such as blocking potential wins by taking crucial tokens.
- **Limited Resources**: As tokens are removed from the pool, options diminish, increasing the complexity of decisions in later turns.
