In the game environment, the action space consists of indices ranging from 0 to 19, representing the numbers 1 to 20 in the game. An action index corresponds directly to the number it represents. For example, an action index of 0 maps to the number 1, an index of 1 maps to the number 2, and so on up to an index of 19, which maps to the number 20. When a player chooses an action index, the corresponding number is removed from the list if it satisfies the current parity requirement.
