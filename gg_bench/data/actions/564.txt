The action space indices (0 to 48) in the game correspond to the numbers 2 to 50 in the game, respectively. Each index `i` in the action space maps to the actual number `i + 2`. This translation allows the agent to select numbers using zero-based indexing, aligning with typical array indexing in programming, while the game itself uses numbers starting from 2.
