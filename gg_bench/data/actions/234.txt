In the action space of the "Capture the Flag" gym environment, the indices represent the distance a player can move towards the flag. Specifically, an action space index of 0 corresponds to moving 1 position forward, while an index of 1 corresponds to moving 2 positions forward. This mapping allows players to decide how fast they want to advance based on their selected action.
