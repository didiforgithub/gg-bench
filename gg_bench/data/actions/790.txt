In the game, the action space indices (0-9) correspond directly to the numbers available in the Number Pool (1-10). Selecting an action with an index of `i` represents choosing the number `i + 1` from the pool. Each chosen number can only be selected once, and thus each index in the action space is available for selection until it corresponds to a number that has been picked by either player.
