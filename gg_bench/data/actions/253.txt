The action space indices in the game map directly to the movement values as follows: action index `0` corresponds to a movement of `1` step, action index `1` corresponds to `2` steps, and action index `2` corresponds to `3` steps. This mapping translates the abstract action choices into concrete movements on the number line for the players.
