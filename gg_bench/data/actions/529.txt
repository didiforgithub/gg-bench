In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 8, each corresponding to a move where the player selects a digit from 1 to 9 to append to the current number. Specifically, action index 0 maps to digit 1, index 1 maps to digit 2, index 2 maps to digit 3, and so on up to index 8 mapping to digit 9. This mapping allows players to select digits strategically to build the shared number while adhering to game rules.
