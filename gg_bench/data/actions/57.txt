The action space indices for the game correspond to moves as follows: indices 0 to 8 map to selecting and marking the respective cells on the 3x3 grid, treated as a list. Specifically, index 0 represents cell (1,1), index 1 represents cell (1,2), and so on, following row-major order up to index 8, which represents cell (3,3). Index 9 is reserved for passing a turn.
