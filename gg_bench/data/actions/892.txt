In the provided gym environment for the "Double Up" game, actions are represented as indices in the action space, which range from 0 to MAX_NUMBER - 1. Each action index corresponds to a move in the game through a simple mapping: the actual number selected in the game is `M = action + 1`. This means if a player chooses an action `a`, the game interprets this as the player choosing the number `a + 1` to add to the sequence, aligning with the valid number selection rules of the game. This mapping allows for an intuitive translation between the action space and the game's number selection mechanism.
