In the Divisor Duel gym environment, the action space consists of discrete integers ranging from 0 to the starting number (60, inclusive). Each integer in the action space represents a potential move where the integer itself is considered as a divisor to subtract from the current number. However, only integers that are proper divisors of the current number (greater than 1 and evenly divide the current number) are valid actions. When a player selects an action, it is mapped directly to the integer value of the divisor they choose to subtract. Moves are validated by checking if the selected integer is a proper divisor of the current number.
