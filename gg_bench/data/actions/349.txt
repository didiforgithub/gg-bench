In the gym environment for the game, the action space indices from 0 to 7 correspond to the valid multipliers in the game, which are integers from 2 to 9. Specifically, the index `0` corresponds to the multiplier `2`, index `1` corresponds to `3`, and so on, up to index `7`, which corresponds to the multiplier `9`. Therefore, when a player selects an action index, it is used to derive the multiplier by adding `2` to the index value.
