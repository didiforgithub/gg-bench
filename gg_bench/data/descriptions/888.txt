# **Product 100**

## **Objective**

The objective of **Product 100** is to be the first player to reach a cumulative product of exactly **100** by multiplying integers from **2** to **9**. Players take turns selecting numbers to multiply with the current total, strategically choosing factors to reach the target product without exceeding it. The player who achieves a total product of exactly **100** wins the game. If a player's move causes the total product to exceed **100**, they lose.

---

## **Setup**

- **Players**: Two players participate in the game.
- **Starting Total**: The game begins with a cumulative product total of **1**.
- **Available Numbers**: Integers from **2** to **9** are available for multiplication on each turn.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Cumulative Product Total**: A running total that starts at **1** and is updated each turn by multiplying the chosen number.
- **Number Pool**: The set of integers from **2** to **9**. These numbers can be used multiple times throughout the game.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen numbers.

---

## **Turns**

- Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- **On a Player's Turn**:
  - **Input**: The player selects a number between **2** and **9**.
  - **Action**: The selected number is multiplied with the current cumulative product total.
  - **Update**: The new total becomes the cumulative product for the next turn.
- **Turn Progression**:
  1. **Display** the current cumulative product total.
  2. **Prompt** the current player for a number between **2** and **9**.
  3. **Validate** the input to ensure it is within the allowed range.
  4. **Multiply** the selected number with the cumulative product total.
  5. **Update** and **announce** the new total.
  6. **Check** for win or loss conditions.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On each turn, a player must choose an integer between **2** and **9** (inclusive).
   - The chosen number is used to multiply the cumulative product total.
2. **Cumulative Product Total**:
   - The game starts with a cumulative product of **1**.
   - The cumulative product is updated each turn by multiplying the selected number.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a cumulative product total of exactly **100** wins the game.
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's move causes the cumulative product total to exceed **100**, that player loses the game immediately.
5. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players must select numbers within the allowed range (**2** to **9**).
   - Input must be a valid integer; otherwise, the player is prompted to re-enter.
6. **Reusing Numbers**:
   - Numbers from **2** to **9** can be reused any number of times by either player.
7. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players should plan ahead to avoid forcing themselves into a position where any move would exceed **100**.
   - Understanding factors and multiples of numbers leading up to **100** can provide a strategic advantage.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory**: Achieving a cumulative product of exactly **100**.
- **Defeat**: Causing the cumulative product to exceed **100**.
- The game does not track points beyond determining the winner of each match.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game Play**

**Starting the Game**

- The cumulative product total is **1**.
- **Player 1** begins.

---

**Turn 1**

- **Current Total**: 1
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 5
  - **Calculation**: 1 × 5 = 5
  - **New Total**: 5
- **Game Continues**

---

**Turn 2**

- **Current Total**: 5
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 4
  - **Calculation**: 5 × 4 = 20
  - **New Total**: 20
- **Game Continues**

---

**Turn 3**

- **Current Total**: 20
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 5
  - **Calculation**: 20 × 5 = 100
  - **New Total**: 100
- **Result**:
  - **Player 1** reaches exactly **100** and **wins** the game.

### **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

```
Starting Product: 1

Player 1, it's your turn.
Current Total: 1
Choose a number between 2 and 9: 5
You chose 5.
New Total: 5

Player 2, it's your turn.
Current Total: 5
Choose a number between 2 and 9: 4
You chose 4.
New Total: 20

Player 1, it's your turn.
Current Total: 20
Choose a number between 2 and 9: 5
You chose 5.
New Total: 100

Congratulations, Player 1! You reached exactly 100 and win the game!
```

**Example of Exceeding 100**

**Turn 4**

- **Current Total**: 60
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 2
  - **Calculation**: 60 × 2 = 120
  - **New Total**: 120
- **Result**:
  - The total exceeds **100**.
  - **Player 2** loses the game.
  - **Player 1** wins by default.

### **Alternate Scenario**

**Turn 1**

- **Current Total**: 1
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 3
  - **New Total**: 3

**Turn 2**

- **Current Total**: 3
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 9
  - **New Total**: 27

**Turn 3**

- **Current Total**: 27
- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 3
  - **Calculation**: 27 × 3 = 81
  - **New Total**: 81

**Turn 4**

- **Current Total**: 81
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Chooses**: 2
  - **Calculation**: 81 × 2 = 162
  - **New Total**: 162
- **Result**:
  - The total exceeds **100**.
  - **Player 2** loses.
  - **Player 1** wins the game.

## **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the result of your multiplication to avoid exceeding **100**.
- **Factor Awareness**: Be mindful of the factors of numbers approaching **100**.
- **Force the Opponent's Hand**: Try to leave the total at a number where any move by the opponent could cause them to exceed **100**.
- **Stay Below Critical Thresholds**: Avoid totals where only limited moves are possible without losing.
