The action space indices in the gym environment map directly to the allowed numbers players can add to the current total. Specifically, each action index from 0 to 5 corresponds to adding numbers from 1 to 6 respectively. For example, action index 0 maps to adding 1, action index 1 maps to adding 2, ..., and action index 5 maps to adding 6. This mapping allows players to input their choice as an action, which the environment interprets as the corresponding addition to the current total.
