# Energy Capture

---

## Objective

**Energy Capture** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where players allocate limited energy units to capture energy nodes. The primary goal is to capture a majority of the energy nodes (at least 3 out of 5). The player who first achieves this wins the game.

---

## Setup

- **Energy Nodes:** There are five energy nodes labeled **Node 1** to **Node 5**.
- **Energy Units:** Each player starts with **15 energy units**.
- **Hidden Allocations:** Players will allocate their energy units to nodes secretly during their turns.

---

## Game Components

### 1. Energy Nodes

- **Quantity:** Five nodes (Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5).
- **Functionality:** Each node can be captured by a player based on energy allocation.
- **Attributes:** Represented numerically in the command-line interface.

### 2. Energy Units

- **Quantity per Player:** 15 units.
- **Functionality:** Used to bid for control over energy nodes.
- **Attributes:** Represented as numerical values.

### 3. Allocation Chart

- **Purpose:** A private record for each player to keep track of their energy allocations.
- **Functionality:** In the command-line interface, this is handled by prompting each player for inputs without revealing them to the opponent.

## Turns

### Allocation Phase

1. **Turn Order:**

   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss or agreement).
   - Players alternate turns.

2. **Player's Turn Actions:**

   - **Allocate Energy Units:**
     - Allocate any number of remaining energy units to one or more nodes.
     - Allocations are cumulative and cannot be changed once made.
   - **Pass:**
     - A player may choose to pass if they do not wish to allocate more energy units.
     - Once a player passes, they cannot make any more allocations for the rest of the Allocation Phase.

3. **Hidden Allocations:**

   - All allocations are made secretly.
   - Opponent does not see the allocations until the Reveal Phase.

4. **Allocation Restrictions:**

   - Players cannot allocate more energy units than they have remaining.
   - Players may allocate to any node, regardless of previous allocations.

### Reveal Phase

1. **Reveal Allocations:**

   - After both players have passed, all energy allocations are revealed.
   - The energy units allocated to each node by both players are compared.

2. **Node Capture Determination:**

   - **Higher Allocation Wins:** The player who allocated more energy units to a node captures it.
   - **Tie:** If both players allocated the same number of energy units to a node, it remains neutral and is not captured by either player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Energy Allocation Rules

- **Energy Management:** Each player has a total of 15 energy units to allocate.
- **Allocation Strategy:** Players must decide how to distribute their energy units across the nodes to outbid their opponent.
- **No Reallocation:** Once energy units are allocated to a node, they cannot be moved or removed.

### Node Capture

- **Capturing Nodes:** Nodes are captured based on who allocated more energy units to them.
- **Neutral Nodes:** Nodes with equal allocations remain unclaimed.

### Winning the Game

- **Majority Capture:** The first player to capture at least **three nodes** wins the game.
- **No Majority:** If neither player captures a majority, the player with the most nodes wins.
- **Tie Scenario:** If both players capture the same number of nodes, proceed to the **Sudden Death Round**.

### Sudden Death Round

1. **Setup:**

   - Only the unclaimed (neutral) nodes are contested.
   - Each player receives an additional **5 energy units**.

2. **Allocation Phase:**

   - Players allocate their additional energy units to the neutral nodes.
   - The same allocation rules apply.
   - Allocations are made secretly and cannot exceed the available energy units.

3. **Reveal Phase:**

   - Allocations are revealed.
   - Nodes are awarded based on higher allocations.

4. **Winning Condition:**

   - The player who captures a majority of the nodes after the Sudden Death Round wins.

---

## Scoring

- **Captured Nodes:**

  - Each captured node counts as **one point**.

- **Winning the Game:**

  - **Immediate Win:** Capture at least three nodes in the initial round.
  - **Sudden Death Victory:** Win additional nodes during the Sudden Death Round to achieve a majority.

- **Tie Breaker:**

  - If a tie persists after the Sudden Death Round, repeat the Sudden Death Round until a winner is determined.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial Allocations:**

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  - Allocates **5 units** to Node 1.

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  - Allocates **6 units** to Node 1.

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  - Allocates **7 units** to Node 2.

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  - Allocates **5 units** to Node 2.

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  - Allocates **2 units** to Node 3.

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  - Allocates **4 units** to Node 3.

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  - Allocates **1 unit** to Node 4.

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  - Passes (no energy units remaining).

**Energy Units Remaining:**

- **Player 1:** 0 units
- **Player 2:** 0 units

### Reveal Phase:

1. **Node 1:**

   - Player 1: 5 units
   - Player 2: 6 units
   - **Winner:** Player 2 captures Node 1.

2. **Node 2:**

   - Player 1: 7 units
   - Player 2: 5 units
   - **Winner:** Player 1 captures Node 2.

3. **Node 3:**

   - Player 1: 2 units
   - Player 2: 4 units
   - **Winner:** Player 2 captures Node 3.

4. **Node 4:**

   - Player 1: 1 unit
   - Player 2: 0 units
   - **Winner:** Player 1 captures Node 4.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

**Allocation Phase:**

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  ```
  Player 1, allocate your energy units:
  - Energy units remaining: 15
  - Enter allocation (e.g., Node1:5, Node2:3): Node1:5
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  ```
  Player 2, allocate your energy units:
  - Energy units remaining: 15
  - Enter allocation: Node1:6
  ```

- **Player 1's Turn:**

  ```
  Player 1, allocate your energy units:
  - Energy units remaining: 10
  - Enter allocation: Node2:7
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn:**

  ```
  Player 2, allocate your energy units:
  - Energy units remaining: 9
  - Enter allocation: Node2:5
  ```

- **...**

**Reveal Phase:**

- The game displays the allocations for each node and announces the winner of each node.

  ```
  Node 1:
    - Player 1: 5 units
    - Player 2: 6 units
    - Winner: Player 2

  Node 2:
    - Player 1: 7 units
    - Player 2: 5 units

## Strategy Tips

- **Energy Management:**

  - **Balance Allocations:** Don't overspend on a single node unless necessary.
  - **Reserve Units:** Keep some energy units for later turns to respond to your opponent's moves.

- **Predict Opponent's Moves:**

  - **Observation:** Consider which nodes your opponent might prioritize.
  - **Counterplay:** Allocate enough units to outbid your opponent on key nodes.

- **Decoy Tactics:**

  - **Misdirection:** Allocate a small number of units to a node to bait your opponent into overspending.
  - **Stealth:** Save your largest allocations for later turns to surprise your opponent.

- **Securing Nodes:**

  - **Guarantee Capture:** Allocate more units than necessary to ensure you win crucial nodes.
  - **Avoid Ties:** Even numbers can lead to ties; aim for allocations that outmatch potential equal splits.

By mastering energy allocation and anticipating your opponent's strategy, you can dominate the energy nodes and secure victory in **Energy Capture**. Enjoy the duel!
