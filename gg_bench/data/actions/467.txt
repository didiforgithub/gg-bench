The action space in the game is represented by discrete indices ranging from 0 to 8, each mapping to a specific cell in the 3x3 grid. These indices correspond to the grid positions in row-major order:

- Index 0 corresponds to grid position (0, 0).
- Index 1 corresponds to grid position (0, 1).
- Index 2 corresponds to grid position (0, 2).
- Index 3 corresponds to grid position (1, 0).
- Index 4 corresponds to grid position (1, 1).
- Index 5 corresponds to grid position (1, 2).
- Index 6 corresponds to grid position (2, 0).
- Index 7 corresponds to grid position (2, 1).
- Index 8 corresponds to grid position (2, 2).

Players choose an action by specifying the index of the unclaimed grid cell they wish to claim.
