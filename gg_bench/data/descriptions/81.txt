**Sequence Duel**

---

**Objective**

Sequence Duel is a two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to create a sequence in which the sum of the last three numbers equals a predetermined target sum. The primary goal is to strategically select numbers to build this sequence while potentially blocking your opponent from doing the same. The player who successfully forms such a sequence first wins the game. There is no possibility of a draw.

---

**Setup**

1. **Determine the Target Sum**: Before the game begins, both players agree on a target sum that the last three numbers in the sequence must add up to for a win (e.g., 15).

2. **Starting Conditions**:
   - The shared sequence starts empty.
   - Both players have access to numbers 1 through 9 for selection each turn.

3. **Player Positions**:
   - Players decide who will take the first turn (Player 1 and Player 2) by mutual agreement or random selection.

---

**Game Components**

1. **Numbers (1-9)**:
   - Digits from 1 to 9 are the fundamental elements used in the game.
   - All numbers are available to both players on every turn.
   - Numbers can be reused multiple times throughout the game.

2. **Shared Sequence**:
   - A single sequence of numbers is shared between both players.
   - The sequence grows as players alternately append numbers to it.
   - The sequence is visible to both players at all times.

3. **Target Sum**:
   - A specific sum agreed upon before the game starts (e.g., 10, 12, 15).
   - The objective revolves around achieving this sum with the last three numbers in the sequence.

---

**Turns**

1. **Turn Order**:
   - The game proceeds in alternating turns starting with Player 1.

2. **Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Select a Number**: The player chooses any number from 1 to 9.
   - **Append to Sequence**: The chosen number is added to the end of the shared sequence.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a player makes their move, the turn passes to the other player.
   - The sequence continues to build with each turn until a win condition is met.

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players may select any number from 1 to 9 on their turn.
   - Numbers are not removed from play after being selected and can be chosen multiple times by either player.

2. **Building the Sequence**:
   - The game revolves around a single, continuous sequence.
   - Each player's chosen number is added to the end of this sequence.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins if, after their turn, the sum of the last three numbers in the sequence equals the target sum.
   - Only the last three numbers are considered when checking for a win.
   - The sequence must have at least three numbers before a win is possible.

4. **No Draws or Stalemates**:
   - The game continues indefinitely until a player meets the winning condition.
   - There are no circumstances under which the game can end in a draw.

5. **Strategy and Blocking**:
   - Players must balance between advancing toward the target sum and preventing their opponent from reaching it.
   - Strategic selection of numbers can block an opponent's potential to win on their next turn.

6. **Invalid Moves**:
   - All moves consist of selecting a number from 1 to 9 and are inherently valid.
   - Players cannot skip a turn or pass; they must select a number on each turn.

7. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player achieves the target sum with the last three numbers.
   - The victorious player is declared the winner.

**Scoring**

- The game does not utilize a point-based scoring system.
- Victory is solely determined by fulfilling the winning condition.
- The player who achieves the target sum with the last three numbers of the sequence wins the game.

**Examples**

*Example 1: Target Sum is 15*

- **Sequence Progression**:
  1. **Player 1** chooses **5**. Sequence: **5**
  2. **Player 2** chooses **7**. Sequence: **5, 7**
  3. **Player 1** chooses **3**. Sequence: **5, 7, 3**
     - Sum of last three numbers: **5 + 7 + 3 = 15**
     - **Player 1 wins**

*Example 2: Target Sum is 12*

- **Sequence Progression**:
  1. **Player 1** chooses **2**. Sequence: **2**
  2. **Player 2** chooses **4**. Sequence: **2, 4**
  3. **Player 1** chooses **6**. Sequence: **2, 4, 6**
     - Sum: **2 + 4 + 6 = 12**
     - **Player 1 wins**

*Example 3: Target Sum is 10*

- **Sequence Progression**:
  1. **Player 1** chooses **1**. Sequence: **1**
  2. **Player 2** chooses **2**. Sequence: **1, 2**
  3. **Player 1** chooses **3**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3**
     - Sum: **1 + 2 + 3 = 6** (No win)
  4. **Player 2** chooses **4**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3, 4**
     - Sum of last three: **2 + 3 + 4 = 9** (No win)
  5. **Player 1** chooses **5**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**
     - Sum of last three: **3 + 4 + 5 = 12** (No win)
  6. **Player 2** chooses **2**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2**
     - Sum of last three: **4 + 5 + 2 = 11** (No win)
  7. **Player 1** chooses **2**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2**
     - Sum of last three: **5 + 2 + 2 = 9** (No win)
  8. **Player 2** chooses **3**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3**
     - Sum of last three: **2 + 2 + 3 = 7** (No win)
  9. **Player 1** chooses **5**. Sequence: **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 5**
     - Sum of last three: **2 + 3 + 5 = 10**
     - **Player 1 wins**

**Sample Command-Line Interaction**

*Assuming the target sum is 12.*

```
Game Start: Target Sum is 12

Sequence: 
Player 1's turn. Choose a number (1-9): 3

Sequence: 3
Player 2's turn. Choose a number (1-9): 5

Sequence: 3, 5
Player 1's turn. Choose a number (1-9): 4

Sequence: 3, 5, 4
Sum of last three numbers: 3 + 5 + 4 = 12
Player 1 wins!
```

**Strategic Tips**

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Pay attention to the sequence progression to anticipate which numbers your opponent might choose next.

- **Control the Sum**: Aim to select numbers that contribute to your potential winning sum while preventing the opponent from achieving theirs.

- **Flexibility**: Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on the numbers added to the sequence.

- **Calculation**: Continuously calculate the sum of the last two numbers to determine which number you need to select to achieve the target sum.

With straightforward rules and minimal components, it is easy to code for a command-line interface and engages players in quick, competitive play. The game's unique mechanics ensure that each match is dynamic, and skilled players can consistently outmaneuver less experienced opponents.
