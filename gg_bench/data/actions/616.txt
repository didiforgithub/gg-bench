In the Sequence Capture game environment, the action space indices, which range from 0 to 19, correspond directly to selecting numbers from 1 to 20 in the game. Each action index `i` maps to the game move of selecting the number `i + 1`. For example, action index 0 corresponds to picking the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to picking the number 2, and so on, up to action index 19, which corresponds to picking the number 20. This straightforward mapping allows each action space index to represent a potential move within the game.
