# Prime Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly 100 points** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool. Utilize prime numbers to gain extra turns and outmaneuver your opponent. The player who reaches exactly 100 points first **wins** the game. If a player exceeds 100 points, their score resets to 50, adding a layer of strategic planning to prevent overshooting the target.

## Setup

1. **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers ranging from **1 to 50**. All numbers are available at the start and can only be chosen once during the game.
2. **Player Scores**: Both players start with a score of **0 points**.
3. **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss or agreement).

## Game Components

- **Number Pool (1-50)**: A list of numbers from which players select during their turns. Each number can be chosen only once.
- **Player Score Tracker**: A means to keep track of each player's current score (e.g., paper and pencil, or digital display).
- **Prime Numbers**: Special numbers within the pool that grant an immediate extra turn when selected.

## Turns

1. **Selection Phase**:
   - On their turn, a player selects an **available number** from the number pool.
   - The chosen number is **removed** from the pool and **added** to the player's total score.
2. **Prime Number Bonus**:
   - If the selected number is a **prime number**, the player receives **an immediate extra turn**.
   - The player continues to take turns as long as they keep selecting prime numbers.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Once a player selects a non-prime number, and any awarded extra turns are completed, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players may choose **any remaining number** from the pool on their turn.
   - Each number can be selected **only once** during the game.
2. **Scoring**:
   - The selected number's value is **added** to the player's total score.
   - **Prime numbers** grant an **extra turn** immediately after being selected.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach **exactly 100 points** wins the game.
   - If a player's score exceeds 100 points, their score is **reset to 50 points**, and the game continues.
4. **Score Reset Mechanics**:
   - Overshooting 100 points penalizes the player by resetting their score to 50.
   - This rule encourages careful planning to avoid exceeding the target score.
5. **Game End Conditions**:
   - A player reaches exactly 100 points (win).
   - All numbers in the pool are exhausted without a player reaching 100 (in this rare case, the player with the score closest to 100 wins).

## Scoring

- **Adding Points**: Players continually add the value of selected numbers to their total score.
- **Prime Number Advantage**: Selecting prime numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) provides extra turns, allowing for potential rapid score increases.
- **Score Reset**: Exceeding 100 points resets the player's score to 50, which can be a strategic setback.

## Examples

### Sample Turn Sequence

**Initial State**:

- Player 1 Score: 0
- Player 2 Score: 0
- Number Pool: 1-50

---

**Player 1's Turn**:

- Chooses **7** (prime).
- Adds 7 to their score: **0 + 7 = 7**.
- Since 7 is prime, Player 1 gets an **extra turn**.

**Player 1's Extra Turn**:

- Chooses **13** (prime).
- Adds 13 to their score: **7 + 13 = 20**.
- Since 13 is prime, Player 1 gets another **extra turn**.

**Player 1's Extra Turn**:

- Chooses **10** (not prime).
- Adds 10 to their score: **20 + 10 = 30**.
- 10 is not prime, so turn passes to Player 2.

---

**Player 2's Turn**:

- Chooses **11** (prime).
- Adds 11 to their score: **0 + 11 = 11**.
- Since 11 is prime, Player 2 gets an **extra turn**.

**Player 2's Extra Turn**:

- Chooses **17** (prime).
- Adds 17 to their score: **11 + 17 = 28**.
- Since 17 is prime, Player 2 gets another **extra turn**.

**Player 2's Extra Turn**:

- Chooses **25** (not prime).
- Adds 25 to their score: **28 + 25 = 53**.
- 25 is not prime, so turn passes to Player 1.

---

**Continuation**:

Players continue in this manner, strategically selecting numbers to reach exactly 100 points while leveraging primes for extra turns and avoiding exceeding 100.

### Strategic Decision-Making

- **Avoiding Overshoot**: If a player has 95 points, they should avoid selecting numbers higher than 5 to prevent resetting their score.
- **Prime Utilization**: Players may prioritize remaining prime numbers to gain extra turns, especially when trailing.
- **Blocking Strategy**: A player may select a number that their opponent needs to reach 100 to block their path to victory.
