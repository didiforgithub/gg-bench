# Factor Elimination: A Two-Player Strategy Game

## Objective

**Factor Elimination** is a strategic two-player game where players take turns selecting numbers from a shared list. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. A player wins by making the last valid selection, leaving no available numbers for the opponent.

## Setup

- **Initial Number List**: Create a list of consecutive positive integers starting from 1 up to a predetermined maximum number, typically **10** for a quick game.
- **Player Positions**: Players decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
- **Starting Conditions**: All numbers in the initial list are unmarked and available for selection.

## Game Components

- **Number List**: A shared list of integers (e.g., 1 through 10) displayed in the command-line interface.
  - **Appearance**: Numbers are displayed in sequence and updated after each turn to show available numbers.
  - **Functionality**: Represents the pool of numbers players can select from during their turn.
- **Marked Numbers**: Selected numbers and their associated factors and multiples, which are removed from availability.
- **Player Indicators**: Denote which player's turn it is, typically as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Player Actions During Turn**:
  1. **Selection**: Choose one available number from the list.
  2. **Elimination**: Remove the selected number and all of its factors and multiples from the list of available numbers.
- **Progression of Turns**: The game continues with players alternating turns until one player cannot make a valid selection.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Selection Rule**: On their turn, a player must select **one** number from the list of available numbers.
2. **Elimination Rule**: Upon selecting a number:
   - Remove the **selected number** from the list.
   - Remove all **factors** of the selected number from the list.
   - Remove all **multiples** of the selected number from the list.
3. **Availability**: Only numbers that have not been removed are available for selection.
4. **End Condition**: If a player cannot select any number because none are available at the start of their turn, they **lose** the game.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Factors and Multiples**:
  - **Factors**: Numbers that divide evenly into the selected number (excluding the number itself if desired for variation).
  - **Multiples**: Numbers that the selected number divides evenly into.
- **Command-Line Interaction**:
  - Players input the number they wish to select.
  - The game updates the list and displays the remaining available numbers after each turn.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who successfully makes the last valid selection, leaving the opponent with no available moves, **wins** the game.
- **Losing the Game**: A player **loses** if:
  - They start their turn and there are **no available numbers** to select.
  - They **forfeit** or make an **invalid move** (selecting a number not in the available list).
