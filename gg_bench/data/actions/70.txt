In the game "Tail End," the action space indices (ranging from 0 to 6) directly map to the selection of the coins on the board, where each index corresponds to a specific coin position. The indices represent choosing to flip a coin at that position, taking actions on coins 1 through 7. For example, an action with index 0 corresponds to selecting the first coin, index 1 to the second coin, and so on, up to index 6 for the seventh coin.
