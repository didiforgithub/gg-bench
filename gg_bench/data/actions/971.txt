In the game, the action space indices correspond to the positions of the digits that the player can choose to remove from their opponent's number:

- **Index 0**: Removes the leftmost digit (hundreds place when the number has three digits).
- **Index 1**: Removes the middle digit (tens place when the number has three digits). This option is unavailable when the number has only two digits.
- **Index 2**: Removes the rightmost digit (ones place).
