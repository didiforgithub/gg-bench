# Divisibility Duel Rule Book

---

## Objective:

Become the first player to create a number divisible by **7** by sequentially appending digits from **1** to **9** to a shared number. Players take turns selecting unused digits and adding them to the end of the current number. The player who, on their turn, forms a number divisible by **7** wins the game.

---

## Setup:

- **Shared Number**: Initialize the shared number to **0**.
- **Available Digits**: Create a list of digits from **1** to **9**. All digits are initially unused.
- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

---

## Game Components:

- **Shared Number**: A number that builds up as players append digits; starts at **0**.
- **Available Digits**: The digits **1** through **9**, each of which can be used only once.
- **Players**: Two participants who alternate turns.

---

## Turns:

### Turn Order:

- Players decide who takes the first turn, e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement.
- Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.

### Turn Structure:

1. **Display Status**:
   - Show the current shared number.
   - List the available unused digits.

2. **Select Digit**:
   - The player chooses an unused digit from **1** to **9**.

3. **Append Digit**:
   - Append the selected digit to the end of the shared number.

4. **Update Shared Number**:
   - The shared number is updated to reflect the appended digit.

5. **Divisibility Check**:
   - Check if the new shared number is divisible by **7**.
   - If it is divisible, the player wins the game.

6. **Proceed to Next Turn**:
   - If the game hasn't been won, proceed to the next player's turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics:

### Digit Selection:

- **Unused Digits Only**: Players must select from the pool of unused digits.
- **One Digit per Turn**: Only one digit may be selected and appended per turn.
- **No Skipping**: Players cannot pass their turn; a digit must be selected.

### Appending Digits:

- The selected digit is concatenated to the right end of the shared number.
  - E.g., If the shared number is **12** and the player selects **3**, the new shared number becomes **123**.
- Leading zeros are allowed only at the very beginning (e.g., appending **0** to **0**).

### Divisibility Check:

- After each turn, check if the updated shared number is divisible by **7**.
- Use standard mathematical divisibility checks or modulo operation.

### Winning the Game:

- **Immediate Win**: If a player creates a number divisible by **7** on their turn, they win immediately.
- **Fallback Victory**:
  - If all digits are used and no player has formed a number divisible by **7**, the player whose final number is **closest** to a multiple of **7** wins.
  - If there is a tie (both players are equally close), the **last player** to have moved **loses**.

---

## Scoring:

- **Win Condition**: Forming a number divisible by **7** on your turn.
- **Fallback Win**: Closest final number to a multiple of **7** if all digits are used without a direct win.
- **Tie-Breaker**: In case of an equal distance to the nearest multiple of **7**, the player who did **not** make the last move wins.

---

## Examples:

### Example Game:

**Game Start**:

- Shared Number: **0**
- Available Digits: **1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9**

**Turn 1 (Player 1)**:

- Selects digit **1**.
- New Shared Number: **1**
- **1 % 7 = 1** (Not divisible by 7)
- Available Digits: **2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9**

**Turn 2 (Player 2)**:

- Selects digit **4**.
- New Shared Number: **14**
- **14 % 7 = 0** (Divisible by 7)
- **Player 2 wins the game.**

---

### Command-Line Interaction Example:

**Game Start**:
```
Starting Number: 0
Available Digits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

**Player 1's Turn**:
```
Player 1, select a digit to append: 1
New Number: 1
Available Digits: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 is not divisible by 7.
```

**Player 2's Turn**:
```
Player 2, select a digit to append: 4
New Number: 14
Available Digits: 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
14 is divisible by 7!
Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategic Considerations:

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider how your chosen digit affects future possibilities for both players.
- **Divisibility Rules**: Familiarity with divisibility rules for **7** can guide better decision-making.
- **Digit Management**: Keep track of remaining digits to anticipate potential moves by your opponent.
- **Block Opponent**: Choose digits that may prevent your opponent from creating a number divisible by **7** on their next turn.

---

## Additional Notes:

- **Game Duration**: The game will last a maximum of **9 turns** since each digit from **1** to **9** is used once.
- **Fair Play**: Both players should have equal opportunities; consider alternating who goes first in multiple games.
- **Variations**:
  - Change the target divisor (e.g., use **13** or **17** for a different challenge).
  - Allow or disallow leading zeros based on preference.
