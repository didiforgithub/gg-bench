# Multiply to 100

## Objective

**Multiply to 100** is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game. The primary goal of the game is to avoid being the player who causes the shared cumulative total to reach or exceed 100. Players take turns multiplying the current total by an integer between 2 and 9. The player who first causes the total to reach or surpass 100 loses the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Total**: The game begins with a shared cumulative total of **1**.
2. **Players**: Two players are needed, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
3. **No Physical Components**: The game is played entirely via a command-line interface, so no physical components are required.

## Game Components

- **Cumulative Total**: A variable that holds the current total after each player's turn. It starts at **1**.
- **Valid Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive. Players use these numbers to multiply the cumulative total on their turn.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen multipliers via the command line, and the game displays the updated total and relevant messages.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: The game starts with **Player 1**, and turns alternate between the two players.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - On their turn, a player must choose an integer multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - The chosen multiplier is then applied to the current cumulative total.
   - The new total is announced, and the turn passes to the other player.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until the cumulative total reaches or exceeds 100.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Multipliers**:
   - On each turn, a player **must** choose an integer between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - Multiplying by **1** is **not allowed**.
2. **Cumulative Total Update**:
   - The chosen multiplier is multiplied by the current cumulative total to produce a new total.
   - **Example**: If the current total is 5 and the player chooses 3, the new total is 5 × 3 = 15.
3. **Losing Condition**:
   - If a player's action causes the cumulative total to **reach or exceed 100**, that player **loses** the game.
   - The opponent is declared the **winner**.
4. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players **cannot** skip their turn; they must choose a valid multiplier on their turn.
5. **Input Validation**:
   - If a player inputs an invalid number (outside 2-9), they are prompted again for a valid input.
6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw; it continues until one player loses.

## Scoring

- **Winning**:
  - The opponent of the player who causes the total to reach or exceed 100 is declared the **winner**.
- **No Points System**:
  - There is no points system or scoring beyond determining the winner and loser of each game.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players may choose to play multiple rounds and keep track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Example Gameplay

### Sample Game

#### Starting the Game

- The cumulative total is **1**.
- **Player 1** begins the game.

#### Turn by Turn Breakdown

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current Total: 1
   - Player 1 chooses to multiply by **9**.
   - New Total: 1 × 9 = **9**
   - The total is now **9**.
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current Total: 9
   - Player 2 chooses to multiply by **8**.
   - New Total: 9 × 8 = **72**
   - The total is now **72**.
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current Total: 72
   - Player 1 must choose carefully to avoid reaching 100.
   - Possible multipliers are 2-9.
   - Multiplying by **2**: 72 × 2 = 144 (reaches 100+, Player 1 loses)
   - Multiplying by **2** or higher will all result in a total exceeding 100.
   - Therefore, **Player 1** cannot make a move without losing.
   - **Player 1** multiplies by **2** (no other option).
   - New Total: 72 × 2 = **144**
   - The total is now **144**.
   - **Player 1** has caused the total to exceed 100 and **loses** the game.
   - **Player 2** is declared the **winner**.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start!
Current total is 1.

Player 1, enter a multiplier (2-9): 9
Player 1 multiplies the total by 9.
New total is 9.

Player 2, enter a multiplier (2-9): 8
Player 2 multiplies the total by 8.
New total is 72.

Player 1, enter a multiplier (2-9): 2
Player 1 multiplies the total by 2.
New total is 144.

Total has reached or exceeded 100.
Player 1 loses.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**:
  - Players should think ahead about the possible results of their multipliers, considering how their choice will affect the next turn.
- **Control the Total**:
  - Aim to leave the cumulative total in a position where any multiplier the opponent chooses will cause them to lose.
- **Mathematical Analysis**:
  - Skilled players can calculate safe totals to aim for, forcing their opponent into an inevitable loss.

## Tips for Players

- **Avoid High Multipliers Late in the Game**:
  - As the total approaches 100, high multipliers will almost certainly cause a loss.
- **Force the Opponent's Hand**:
  - Try to set up the cumulative total so that no matter what multiplier the opponent picks, they will exceed 100.
- **Practice Mental Math**:
  - Quick calculations help in making better strategic decisions under pressure.

## Conclusion

Multiply to 100 is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and outsmart their opponent. Its straightforward rules and quick gameplay make it easy to learn and enjoyable to play, while the strategic depth ensures that skilled players can consistently outperform unskilled players.

Have fun playing Multiply to 100, and may the best strategist win!
