The action space indices in the Crossroads Clash gym environment correspond to the grid positions in a row-major order. An action index `i` maps to the grid cell at row `i // grid_size` and column `i % grid_size`. This means that each index from 0 to `grid_size * grid_size - 1` uniquely represents a possible move on the grid, where Player 1 and Player 2 can claim unclaimed nodes as part of their strategy to win the game.
