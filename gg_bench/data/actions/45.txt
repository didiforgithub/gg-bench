In the game, the action space is represented by a single integer from 0 to 15, corresponding to each cell in the 4x4 grid. The indices are mapped to grid positions by interpreting the integer as a row-major order index. Specifically:

- **Action Index = row * grid_size + column**
  
This means:
- Index 0 maps to the top-left cell (row 0, column 0).
- Index 1 maps to (row 0, column 1).
- Index 2 maps to (row 0, column 2).
- Index 3 maps to (row 0, column 3).
- ...
- Index 15 maps to the bottom-right cell (row 3, column 3).

To convert an action index to grid coordinates, use:
- **Row** = index // grid_size
- **Column** = index % grid_size
