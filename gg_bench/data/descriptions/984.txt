# Divisor Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game. The primary goal is to force your opponent to reduce the current number to **1**, rendering them unable to make a valid move. The player who avoids being forced into this position wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number Selection**:
   - Players agree on a positive integer **N** greater than **1** to start the game. This number should ideally be a composite number (not prime) to allow for a more engaging game. For example, **N = 16**.
   
2. **Determine Turn Order**:
   - Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method such as a coin toss.

3. **Game Interface**:
   - No physical components are required. The game is played via a command-line interface (CLI) that tracks the current number and prompts players for their moves.

---

## Game Components

- **Starting Number (N)**:
  - A positive integer greater than **1** chosen at the beginning of the game.
  
- **Current Number**:
  - The number that is subject to change each turn based on players' moves.

- **Proper Divisors**:
  - Numbers greater than **1** and less than the current number that divide it exactly (no remainder).

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - The medium through which players input their moves and receive game updates.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Sequence**:
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Identify Valid Moves**: Determine all proper divisors of the current number.
   - **Select a Proper Divisor**: Choose one of the valid proper divisors as the move.
   - **Update Current Number**: The selected proper divisor becomes the new current number.
   - **Declare Move**: Input the chosen proper divisor into the command-line interface.

3. **Progression of Turns**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player loses according to the game rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On each turn, a player must select a proper divisor of the current number.
   - A proper divisor is a positive integer greater than **1** and less than the current number that divides the current number exactly.

2. **Updating the Current Number**:
   - The current number is updated to be the proper divisor selected by the player.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - If a player reduces the current number to **1** on their turn, the opposing player cannot make a move and loses the game.
   - The player who avoids being forced to reduce the current number to **1** wins.

4. **Forfeits and Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player selects an invalid number (not a proper divisor), they forfeit the game.
   - If a player cannot make a move because there are no proper divisors (current number is **1**), they lose.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**:
  - The game results in a win for one player and a loss for the other.
  - There are no draws or point-based scoring mechanisms.

- **Game Tracking**:
  - Players may keep track of wins over multiple games to determine overall performance.

## Examples

### Example Game Starting with N = 16

#### Game Start

```
Game Start! The starting number is 16.
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Current number: 16
Proper divisors of 16: 2, 4, 8
Player 1, select a proper divisor of 16: 8
Player 1 selects 8.
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Current number: 8
Proper divisors of 8: 2, 4
Player 2, select a proper divisor of 8: 4
Player 2 selects 4.
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Current number: 4
Proper divisors of 4: 2
Player 1, select a proper divisor of 4: 2
Player 1 selects 2.
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Current number: 2
Proper divisors of 2: None
Player 2 cannot make a valid move.
```

#### Game End

```
Player 2 has no valid moves left.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Below is a sample of how the game might proceed in a command-line interface:

```
Welcome to Divisor Duel!
Enter the starting number (greater than 1): 16

Player 1 will go first.

Current number is 16
Player 1's turn.
Select a proper divisor of 16: 8
Player 1 selects 8.

Current number is 8
Player 2's turn.
Select a proper divisor of 8: 4
Player 2 selects 4.

Current number is 4
Player 1's turn.
Select a proper divisor of 4: 2
Player 1 selects 2.

Current number is 2
Player 2's turn.
No proper divisors available.
Player 2 cannot make a move and loses.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's responses to your moves.
- **Reduce Options**: Try to leave numbers with fewer proper divisors for your opponent.
- **Avoid Prime Numbers**: Steering the game toward prime numbers can limit your opponent's moves.
