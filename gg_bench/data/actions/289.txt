In the gym environment for Factor Duel, the action space consists of discrete indices that correspond to prime numbers that can be used as valid moves in the game. Each index in the action space is mapped to a prime number from the `primes_list`, which includes all prime numbers up to the initial specified `N_init`. When a player takes an action, they select an index from the action space, which is then mapped to a corresponding prime number. This prime number represents the factor by which the shared number `N` will be divided during that turn. The `prime_indices` dictionary provides the mapping from each prime to its respective index, allowing for this translation between selected actions and game moves.
