The action space in the environment is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 26, which correspond to all possible combinations of three-digit guesses using digits from 1 to 3. The mapping is done as follows: For a given action index, the first digit (`d1`) is determined by integer division of the index by 9, the second digit (`d2`) is determined by integer division of the remainder when the index is divided by 9 by 3, and the third digit (`d3`) is the remainder when the index is divided by 3. These indices (0-2) are then mapped to digits (1-3) by adding 1 to each digit, resulting in a guess. For instance, an action index of 0 maps to the guess `1-1-1`, and an index of 26 maps to `3-3-3`.
