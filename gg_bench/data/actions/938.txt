In the CustomEnv gym environment for GridLock, the action space indices directly correspond to the positions on the 4x4 grid. The grid cells are numbered linearly from 0 to 15. Each index represents a cell where the player can place a marker, calculated as `action = row * 4 + column`, where `row` and `column` are zero-indexed. For example, action 0 corresponds to the cell (0,0), action 1 to (0,1), and so forth up to action 15, which corresponds to the cell (3,3).
