The action space indices (0-7) map to the moves in the game as follows:

- **0-3**: Flip a bit in the current player's own binary number at positions 0-3 (corresponding to bits 1-4 in the description, adjusted for zero indexing).
- **4-7**: Flip a bit in the opponent's binary number at positions 0-3 (also corresponding to bits 1-4 in the description, adjusted for zero indexing).
