# Digit Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Digit Duel** is a strategic two-player game where the primary goal is to reduce your opponent's life points to zero or below. Players achieve victory by carefully selecting digits to either attack the opponent or defend themselves, balancing aggression and protection to outmaneuver their opponent.

## Setup

- **Life Points**: Each player starts with **10 life points**.
- **Digit Pool**: A shared pool of digits from **1** to **9** is available for both players to use.
- **Starting Conditions**: All digits are initially unclaimed and can be selected by either player.

## Game Components

- **Life Points**: Represent each player's health. Players track their own and their opponent's life points throughout the game.
- **Digits (1-9)**: Numbers used to perform attacks or defenses. Each digit can be used only once per game.
- **Digit Pool**: A list of available digits that have not yet been selected by either player.

## Turns

The game is played in turns, starting with **Player 1** and then alternating between players.

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Digit Selection**: The player chooses an available digit from the Digit Pool.
2. **Action Choice**: The player decides to either **attack** the opponent or **defend** themselves using the selected digit.
3. **Execute Action**:
   - **Attack**: Subtract the selected digit from the opponent's life points.
   - **Defend**: Add the selected digit to the player's own life points (maximum of 20 life points).
4. **Update Digit Pool**: Remove the selected digit from the Digit Pool.
5. **End of Turn**: The turn ends, and play passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

- **Digit Usage**:
  - Digits **1 through 9** can each be used **only once per game**.
  - Once a digit is selected by either player, it is **removed** from the Digit Pool and cannot be selected again.
- **Action Execution**:
  - **Attack**:
    - Subtract the selected digit from the opponent's life points.
    - The opponent's life points can drop below zero.
  - **Defend**:
    - Add the selected digit to the player's own life points.
    - A player's life points cannot exceed **20**; any excess is ignored.
- **Life Points**:
  - **Maximum Life Points**: A player's life points cannot exceed 20.
  - **Minimum Life Points**: There is no minimum; life points can be negative.
- **Turn Obligation**:
  - Players **must** select a digit and choose an action on their turn.
  - Players cannot skip their turn or pass.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - A player wins immediately when the opponent's life points are reduced to **zero or below**.
- **No Draws**:
  - If all digits have been used and both players have life points remaining, the player with the **higher life points** wins.
  - If both players have **equal life points** after all digits are used, the game enters **Sudden Death**.

### Sudden Death

If a tie occurs after all digits are used:

1. **Secret Selection**:
   - Each player secretly selects a digit from **1 to 5**.
   - Players can pick any digit in this range, regardless of previous choices.
2. **Reveal**:
   - Both players reveal their chosen digits simultaneously.
3. **Resolve**:
   - The player who chose the **higher digit** gains life points equal to the **difference** between the digits.
   - The opponent **loses** life points equal to the **difference**.
   - If both players select the **same digit**, no life points change.
4. **Repeat**:
   - Steps 1-3 are repeated until one player's life points are **zero or below**.

## Scoring

- **Life Points Tracking**: Both players must keep an accurate record of their own and their opponent's life points after each turn.
- **Digit Pool Tracking**: Keep a visible list of available digits in the Digit Pool so both players know which digits remain.
