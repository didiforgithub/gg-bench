# Number Ladder

---

## Objective

Be the first player to **reach or exceed a total of 30** by strategically selecting numbers from a shared pool, following specific multiple and factor rules. Alternatively, win by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Setup

- **Shared Number Pool**: Numbers from **2** to **10** inclusive.
- **Player Totals**: Each player starts with a total of **0**.
- **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**:
  - Numbers **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10**.
  - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool.
- **Player Totals**:
  - Each player keeps a running total of their selected numbers.

---

## Turns

1. **Initial Turn**:
   - The first player selects **any number** from the shared pool.
2. **Subsequent Turns**:
   - On their turn, a player selects a number that is a **factor or multiple** of the **opponent's last chosen number**.
   - The selected number is added to the player's total.
   - The number is then removed from the shared pool.
3. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns until the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Number Selection**:
   - The number must be a **factor or multiple** of the opponent's previously selected number.
   - If no valid numbers are available, the player loses.
2. **Number Removal**:
   - Once selected, numbers are **removed** from the pool and cannot be used again.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Victory Condition 1**: Be the first to **reach or exceed a total of 30**.
   - **Victory Condition 2**: Force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.
4. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player meets a victory condition.

---

## Scoring

- **Running Total**:
  - Keep a cumulative sum of the numbers each player selects.
- **Winning**:
  - The first player to reach or exceed **30** points wins.
  - Alternatively, if the opponent cannot make a valid move, you win.
