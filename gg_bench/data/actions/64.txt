In the `CustomEnv` environment for the Number Siege game, the action space indices map to moves as follows: 

- **Action 0**: Move 1 position forward.
- **Action 1**: Move 2 positions forward.
- **Action 2**: Move 3 positions forward.

Each index corresponds to increasing the position on the number line by an increment of 1, 2, or 3 based on the selected action, with the direction determined by the player's role (Player 1 moves positively, and Player 2 moves negatively).
