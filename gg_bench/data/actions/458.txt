In the game, the action space consists of 25 discrete actions, represented by indices from 0 to 24. Each action is a combination of selecting one number from the player's set (numbers 1 to 5, indexed as 0 to 4) and targeting a specific position in the opponent's set (positions 0 to 4). The action index is calculated as `own_number_index * 5 + opponent_position`, where `own_number_index` is the index of the player's number (0 to 4) and `opponent_position` is the index of the opponent's number to be targeted (0 to 4). This creates a mapping of all possible combinations of player's number choice and opponent's target position.
