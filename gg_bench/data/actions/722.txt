In the provided gym environment, the action space indices (0 to N-2) directly map to the integers in the initialized game list (2 to N). Each index `i` corresponds to removing the integer at position `i` in the list of consecutive integers `[2, 3, ..., N]`. Thus, selecting an action from the action space, denoted as `action`, results in removing the number `2 + action` from the game list.
