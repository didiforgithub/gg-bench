In the game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 48, corresponding directly to selecting numbers 2 to 50 from the number pool. An action index `i` maps to selecting the number `i + 2` because the number pool starts at 2, so for action index 0, the selected number is 2, for index 1, the number is 3, and so on, up to index 48 which selects 50. This mapping allows players to choose a number on their turn by selecting the appropriate action index within the defined range.
