# Sum to Zero: Rule Book

## Objective

Be the first player to bring the cumulative sum of selected numbers to exactly **zero** by strategically choosing numbers from a shared pool. The game requires players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's moves, ensuring that skilled play leads to consistent victories.

## Setup

- **Shared Number Pool**: A set of integers ranging from **-9 to +9**, excluding zero. The numbers are:
  ```
  -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  ```
- **Cumulative Sum**: Starts at **0**.
- **Players**: Two players, designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**: The list of available numbers players can select from.
- **Cumulative Sum**: The ongoing total sum of all numbers selected by both players.
- **Players**: Each player takes turns selecting numbers to influence the cumulative sum.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **On Your Turn**:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose any one number from the Shared Number Pool.
  2. **Update the Cumulative Sum**: Add the selected number to the Cumulative Sum.
  3. **Announce the Move**: State the selected number and the new Cumulative Sum.
  4. **Remove the Number**: The selected number is removed from the Shared Number Pool and cannot be chosen again.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - You must select one available number from the Shared Number Pool on your turn.
   - You cannot pass or skip your turn.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - The Cumulative Sum is updated by adding the selected number to it.
   - Example: If the current Cumulative Sum is `5` and you select `-3`, the new Cumulative Sum is `5 + (-3) = 2`.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If your selection causes the Cumulative Sum to become exactly **zero**, you **immediately win** the game.
   - The game ends upon reaching a Cumulative Sum of zero; no further turns are taken.

4. **End of Available Numbers**:
   - If all numbers are exhausted without the Cumulative Sum reaching zero, the **last player who made a move** wins the game.
   - This scenario ensures there is **no draw mechanism**.

5. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid as long as there are numbers available in the Shared Number Pool.
   - Even if selecting a number doesn't bring the Cumulative Sum closer to zero, you must select an available number.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by being the player who brings the Cumulative Sum to exactly zero.
- **No Point System**: The game is won through strategic play; there are no points or secondary objectives.
- **Skilled Play Rewarded**: Consistent application of strategy and foresight allows skilled players to outmaneuver less experienced opponents.

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Victory

**Initial Setup**:
- Shared Number Pool:
  ```
  -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  ```
- Cumulative Sum: `0`
- Player 1 starts.

**Turn Sequence**:

1. **Player 1**:
   - Selects `5`.
   - Cumulative Sum: `0 + 5 = 5`.
   - Shared Number Pool now excludes `5`.

2. **Player 2**:
   - Selects `-2`.
   - Cumulative Sum: `5 + (-2) = 3`.
   - Shared Number Pool now excludes `-2`.

3. **Player 1**:
   - Selects `-3`.
   - Cumulative Sum: `3 + (-3) = 0`.
   - **Player 1 wins the game!**

### Example 2: Exhausting Numbers

**Initial Setup**:
- Shared Number Pool:
  ```
  -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  ```
- Cumulative Sum: `0`
- Player 1 starts.

**Turn Sequence**:

- Players take turns selecting numbers, but neither brings the Cumulative Sum to zero.
- All numbers are eventually chosen.
- The last player to have made a move (Player 2) **wins the game** because the Shared Number Pool is empty.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start!

Available Numbers: -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Cumulative Sum: 0

Player 1's turn.
Select a number: 4
Player 1 selects 4.
Cumulative Sum is now 4.

Available Numbers: -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
Player 2's turn.
Select a number: -1
Player 2 selects -1.
Cumulative Sum is now 3.

Available Numbers: -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9
Player 1's turn.
Select a number: -3
Player 1 selects -3.
Cumulative Sum is now 0.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider how your chosen number will affect future Cumulative Sums.
- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Keep track of which numbers remain and how your opponent might use them.
- **Control the Game**: Aim to force the Cumulative Sum into ranges where you have advantageous numbers.
- **Resource Management**: Be mindful of high-impact numbers (e.g., `-9`, `9`) and use them strategically.

## Game Flow Summary

1. **Start the Game**: Initialize the Shared Number Pool and set the Cumulative Sum to zero.
2. **Player Turns**: Players alternate turns, selecting numbers and updating the Cumulative Sum.
3. **Check for Victory**: After each turn, check if the Cumulative Sum is zero.
   - If **yes**, the current player wins.
   - If **no**, continue to the next player's turn.
4. **End of Game**:
   - If the Cumulative Sum reaches zero, the game ends immediately with a winner.
   - If all numbers are used without reaching zero, the last player to have made a move wins.

## Additional Considerations

- **No Skipping Turns**: Players must make a move on their turn; passing is not allowed.
- **No Draws**: The game design ensures that there will always be a winner.
- **Simple Coding**: The game mechanics are straightforward, making it easy to implement in a command-line interface.
