In the game, actions are represented by the indices 0 to 3 in the action space. Each index corresponds to selecting a number to add to the cumulative total:

- Action index 0 maps to selecting the number 1.
- Action index 1 maps to selecting the number 2.
- Action index 2 maps to selecting the number 3.
- Action index 3 maps to selecting the number 4.

This mapping allows players to choose an integer between 1 and 4 by selecting the corresponding action index during their turn.
