# Divide and Conquer: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divide and Conquer** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where players take turns dividing a shared number by its prime factors. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to exactly **1** on their turn. Mastery of prime factorization and strategic foresight will lead you to victory.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a predetermined positive integer \( N \) greater than **1**. This number should be chosen and agreed upon by both players before the game starts. For a quick game, a number between **10** and **50** is recommended.
   
2. **Player Roles**: Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by flipping a coin.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (\( N \))**: The central element of the game, which changes as players make their moves.
- **Prime Factors**: The prime numbers that can exactly divide the current shared number \( N \) without leaving a remainder. Players will use these to reduce \( N \).

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  - **Step 1**: Identify all prime factors of the current shared number \( N \).
  - **Step 2**: Choose one prime factor to divide \( N \) by.
  - **Step 3**: Divide \( N \) by the chosen prime factor to get the new \( N \).
  - **Step 4**: Announce your move and the new value of \( N \) to your opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you must divide the current shared number \( N \) by one of its prime factors greater than **1**.
   - The division must result in an integer (no fractions or decimals).
   
2. **Calculating Prime Factors**:
   - Prime factors are prime numbers that divide \( N \) exactly.
   - For example, if \( N = 18 \), its prime factors are **2** and **3**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces \( N \) to exactly **1** on their turn wins the game.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move because \( N \) is **1** or has no prime factors greater than **1**, they lose.

4. **Example of Invalid Moves**:
   - Dividing by a number that is not a prime factor of \( N \).
   - Performing an operation that does not result in an integer.
   - Attempting to divide when \( N \) is already **1**.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The winner is the player who successfully reduces \( N \) to **1** on their turn according to the rules.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking in **Divide and Conquer**; the outcome is win or lose based on gameplay.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Starting Number (\( N \))**: 30

**Player 1** and **Player 2** will alternate turns to reduce \( N \) to **1**.

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current \( N \)**: 30
   - **Prime Factors of 30**: 2, 3, 5
   - **Choice**: Divide by **5**
   - **Calculation**: \( 30 \div 5 = 6 \)
   - **New \( N \)**: 6
   - **Announcement**: "I divide 30 by 5. New \( N \) is 6."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current \( N \)**: 6
   - **Prime Factors of 6**: 2, 3
   - **Choice**: Divide by **3**
   - **Calculation**: \( 6 \div 3 = 2 \)
   - **New \( N \)**: 2
   - **Announcement**: "I divide 6 by 3. New \( N \) is 2."

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current \( N \)**: 2
   - **Prime Factors of 2**: 2
   - **Choice**: Divide by **2**
   - **Calculation**: \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \)
   - **New \( N \)**: 1
   - **Announcement**: "I divide 2 by 2. New \( N \) is 1."
   - **Result**: Player 1 wins by reducing \( N \) to 1.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Starting Number (\( N \))**: 28

#### Game Start

```
Game Start: N = 28
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Player 1's Turn:

Current N: 28
Prime Factors: 2, 7
Enter your chosen prime factor: 7

Calculation: 28 / 7 = 4

Player 1 divides by 7. New N is 4.
```

#### Player 2's Turn

```
Player 2's Turn:

Current N: 4
Prime Factors: 2
Enter your chosen prime factor: 2

Calculation: 4 / 2 = 2

Player 2 divides by 2. New N is 2.
```

#### Player 1's Turn

```
Player 1's Turn:

Current N: 2
Prime Factors: 2
Enter your chosen prime factor: 2

Calculation: 2 / 2 = 1

Player 1 divides by 2. New N is 1.

Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Think about how your move will affect the next turn. Aim to leave your opponent with a number that limits their options.
- **Prime Factorization**: Familiarize yourself with prime numbers and factorization to make quick decisions.
- **Avoid Certain Numbers**: Be cautious of numbers that can be reduced to **1** by your opponent on their next turn.

## Conclusion

**Divide and Conquer** is a game of numerical strategy and foresight. With simple rules and quick gameplay, it challenges players to think ahead and use basic number theory to outmaneuver their opponent. Enjoy sharpening your mathematical skills in this battle of wits!
