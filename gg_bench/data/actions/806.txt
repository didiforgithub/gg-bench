The action space indices in the game map directly to the positions of cards in the player's hand. Given the player's hand as a list, each index from 0 to the current number of cards - 1 represents a particular card in hand. Choosing an action index corresponds to selecting the card at that particular index in the hand for playing as an attack against the opponent. The environment uses these indices to identify and play the corresponding card during the player's Attack Phase.
