# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce your score to **exactly zero** by strategically subtracting proper divisors of your current score. The player who cannot make a valid move loses the game.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Score:** Both players begin with a score of **50**.
- **First Turn:** Decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin).

---

## Game Components

- **Players' Scores:** Each player has a personal score, starting at **50**.
- **Proper Divisors:** Numbers that evenly divide a player's current score, excluding **1** and the number itself.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns.
- **Player Actions:**
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors:** List all proper divisors of your current score.
  2. **Choose a Divisor:** Select one proper divisor to subtract.
  3. **Update Score:** Subtract the chosen divisor from your current score.
  4. **Announce Move:** Declare your chosen divisor and new score.

- **No Valid Moves:** If a player has no proper divisors (score is a prime number or 1), they lose the game.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Valid Moves

- **Proper Divisors Only:** You may only subtract a proper divisor of your current score.
  - **Proper Divisors:** Positive integers other than 1 and the number itself that divide the number evenly.
  - **Example:** Proper divisors of 8 are **2** and **4**.
- **No Subtracting 1 or Self:** You cannot subtract 1 or your current score.

### 2. Score Calculation

- **Subtracting Divisors:** Your new score is calculated by subtracting the chosen divisor from your current score.
  - **Example:** If your score is 30 and you subtract 10, your new score is 20.
- **Exact Zero:** To win, your score must reach **exactly zero**.
- **No Negative Scores:** Moves resulting in a negative score are invalid.

### 3. Winning and Losing

- **Winning the Game:** Reduce your score to exactly zero.
- **Losing the Game:** If you cannot make a valid move on your turn, you lose.

### 4. Strategy

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate future moves based on potential scores.
- **Force Prime Scores:** Try to leave your opponent with a prime number score.

---

## Scoring

- **Track Scores:** Keep a record of both players' scores after each turn.
- **Game End:** The game ends when a player reaches zero or cannot make a valid move.
  - **Winner:** The player who reduces their score to zero or causes the opponent to have no valid moves.
