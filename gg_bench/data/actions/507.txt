The action space in the "Capture Squares" gym environment is a single integer from 0 to 24, corresponding to cells on the 5x5 grid. The index 0 represents the top-left cell (1,1) and index 24 represents the bottom-right cell (5,5). The mapping follows a row-major order: index 0 is cell (1,1), index 1 is cell (1,2), ..., up to index 4 for cell (1,5), then index 5 for cell (2,1), and so on, incrementing across rows in sequence until index 24 for cell (5,5). Thus, each index directly represents a specific cell on the grid.
