In the action space, indices 0 to 8 map to adding number tokens 1 to 9, respectively, to the player's stack (i.e., index 0 corresponds to the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, and so on up to index 8 corresponding to the number 9). Index 9 represents the 'pass' action, which players can choose when no valid number can be added without exceeding 21.
