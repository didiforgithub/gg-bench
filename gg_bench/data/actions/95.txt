In the given gym environment for the Grid Clash game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, indicating there are 9 possible actions corresponding to the 9 cells in the 3x3 grid. Each action space index (ranging from 0 to 8) directly maps to a specific cell in the grid as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the cell in the top-left corner of the grid.
- Index 1 corresponds to the top-middle cell.
- Index 2 corresponds to the top-right cell.
- Index 3 corresponds to the middle-left cell.
- Index 4 corresponds to the center cell.
- Index 5 corresponds to the middle-right cell.
- Index 6 corresponds to the bottom-left cell.
- Index 7 corresponds to the bottom-middle cell.
- Index 8 corresponds to the bottom-right cell.

This mapping reflects a row-major order traversal of the grid, where each index represents the cell position in a flattened 3x3 grid.
