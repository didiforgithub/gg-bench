# Sum Trap: A Two-Player Command-Line Game

## Objective

**Sum Trap** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where the goal is to be the first player to reach an exact total sum of **50** without exceeding it. Players take turns adding numbers to their individual totals, carefully choosing numbers to avoid surpassing the target while tactically restricting their opponent's options.

## Setup

- **Starting Total**: Both players begin with a total sum of **0**.
- **Number Pool**: Numbers from **1** to **10** are available for players to choose from during their turns.
- **No Repeats**: Players keep track of the numbers chosen in the previous turn to ensure compliance with the rules.

## Game Components

- **Players**: Two participants, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Totals**: Each player has their own cumulative total sum, starting at **0**.
- **Number Choices**: Integers from **1** to **10**, representing the possible choices on each turn.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played in a command-line environment where players input their number choices.

## Turns

1. **Starting Player**: Decide randomly or by agreement who takes the first turn.
2. **Turn Structure**:
   - **Number Selection**: On their turn, the player selects a number from **1** to **10**, ensuring it is not the same number their opponent chose on the immediately preceding turn.
   - **Updating Total**: The chosen number is added to the player's total sum.
   - **Announcement**: The player announces their chosen number and their new total.
3. **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns following the same structure until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Numbers**: On each turn, a player must choose an integer between **1** and **10** inclusive.
- **No Immediate Repeats**: A player **cannot** select the same number their opponent selected on the **previous turn**. However, they may choose any other valid number, including numbers they themselves have chosen on earlier turns.
- **Exact Total of 50**: The objective is to reach a total sum of **exactly 50**. If a player's addition would cause their total to exceed 50, they **lose the game immediately**.
- **Winning the Game**: The first player to reach a total sum of **exactly 50** wins the game.
- **Forcing a Loss**: If both players are unable to reach exactly 50 without exceeding it, the player whose turn it is and cannot make a valid move without exceeding 50 **loses the game**.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Totals**: Each player's cumulative total is tracked throughout the game.
- **Victory Condition**: The game does not use a point system beyond reaching the target total. The focus is on strategic number selection to achieve the exact sum of 50.

## Strategy Tips

- **Avoid Repeats**: Keep track of the numbers your opponent selects to avoid invalid moves.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves to force your opponent into a position where they cannot reach 50 without exceeding it.
- **Number Selection**: Repeatedly selecting high numbers can quickly increase your total but might limit your options later in the game.
- **Control the Pace**: Use smaller numbers strategically to adjust your total and manipulate the flow of the game.
