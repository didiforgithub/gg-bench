# Divide and Conquer

## Objective

**Divide and Conquer** is a two-player turn-based strategy game. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the **Shared Number** to exactly **1** by making valid moves. Alternatively, you can win by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Shared Number Initialization**: The game begins with a **Shared Number** set to a positive integer. For a standard game, the initial Shared Number is **100**.

2. **Player Order**: Decide which player will be **Player 1** and which will be **Player 2**. This can be determined by mutual agreement or by flipping a coin.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A positive integer that both players manipulate according to the game rules. This number changes throughout the game based on players' actions.

- **Players**: Two players who take turns making moves.

---

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Player Action**: On your turn, you must attempt to perform a valid move as per the Rules and Mechanics.

2. **Turn Completion**: After making your move, or if you cannot make a valid move, your turn ends, and play passes to your opponent.

### Turn Progression

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- The game continues until a win condition is met.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Valid Moves

1. **Division by Proper Divisor**:

   - On your turn, **divide** the Shared Number by one of its **proper divisors**.
   - A **proper divisor** is a whole number greater than **1** and less than the Shared Number that divides evenly into the Shared Number (no remainder).

2. **Updating the Shared Number**:

   - The result of your division becomes the new Shared Number.
   - The new Shared Number must be a whole number greater than or equal to **1**.

3. **Restrictions**:

   - You **cannot** divide by **1** or by the Shared Number itself.
   - You **cannot** perform an operation that results in a non-integer or a number less than **1**.

### Winning the Game

- **Reducing to 1**: If, after your move, the Shared Number is exactly **1**, you win the game.

### Losing the Game

- **No Valid Moves**: If it's your turn and the Shared Number is a **prime number** (has no proper divisors), you cannot make a valid move and lose the game.

---

## Scoring

- The game ends when one player wins according to the Rules and Mechanics.
- **Winner**: The player who reduces the Shared Number to **1** on their turn or forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

- **Initial Shared Number**: 100

#### Player 1's Turn:

- **Shared Number**: 100
- **Proper Divisors of 100**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
- **Move**: Divide by **2**
- **New Shared Number**: 50

#### Player 2's Turn:

- **Shared Number**: 50
- **Proper Divisors of 50**: 2, 5, 10, 25
- **Move**: Divide by **2**
- **New Shared Number**: 25

#### Player 1's Turn:

- **Shared Number**: 25
- **Proper Divisors of 25**: 5
- **Move**: Divide by **5**
- **New Shared Number**: 5

#### Player 2's Turn:

- **Shared Number**: 5
- **Proper Divisors of 5**: None (5 is prime)
- **Outcome**: Cannot make a valid move
- **Result**: **Player 2 loses**

**Winner**: **Player 1**

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of your moves to avoid leaving a prime number for your opponent.
- **Prime Awareness**: Be mindful of when the Shared Number could become prime to force your opponent into a losing position.
- **Divisor Selection**: Choose divisors that reduce the Shared Number significantly but avoid setting up your opponent for a winning move.
