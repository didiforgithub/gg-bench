In the game environment, the action space consists of 27 discrete actions. Each action is represented by an index that involves two components: selecting a digit and assigning it to a position on the player's board:

1. **Digit Selection**: The digit is determined by the index divided by 3 (0-based), which corresponds to digits 1 through 9:
   - Action indices 0 to 2 represent digit 1, indices 3 to 5 represent digit 2, and so on, up to indices 24 to 26 for digit 9.

2. **Position Assignment**: The position (hundreds, tens, or ones) is determined by the remainder of the index modulo 3:
   - Remainder 0 indicates the hundreds place, 1 indicates the tens place, and 2 indicates the ones place.

Thus, each action uniquely maps to placing a specific digit in a specific position on the board.
