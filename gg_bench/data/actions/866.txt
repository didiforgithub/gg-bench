The action space in the game "Capture Squares" consists of 9 discrete actions, each corresponding to selecting one of the 9 squares on the 3x3 grid. The indices range from 0 to 8, with each index representing a specific position on the grid. The mapping between the action space indices and the grid positions is as follows:

- Index 0 corresponds to the top-left square (grid position (1,1)).
- Index 1 corresponds to the top-middle square (grid position (1,2)).
- Index 2 corresponds to the top-right square (grid position (1,3)).
- Index 3 corresponds to the middle-left square (grid position (2,1)).
- Index 4 corresponds to the middle square (grid position (2,2)).
- Index 5 corresponds to the middle-right square (grid position (2,3)).
- Index 6 corresponds to the bottom-left square (grid position (3,1)).
- Index 7 corresponds to the bottom-middle square (grid position (3,2)).
- Index 8 corresponds to the bottom-right square (grid position (3,3)).

Each action specifies the selection of the respective square, allowing the player to capture it and potentially capture adjacent, eligible squares based on the game's rules.
