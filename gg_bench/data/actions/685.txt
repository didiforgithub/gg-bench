In the game environment, each action space index corresponds to a specific move that involves either appending a digit or an operator to the arithmetic expression. The indices `0` to `8` map to the digits `1` to `9`, respectively. Index `9` corresponds to the addition operator `+`, and index `10` corresponds to the multiplication operator `*`. This mapping allows players to choose actions within a discrete range of integers to update the expression accordingly.
