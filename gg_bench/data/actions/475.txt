In the `Word Ladder Duel` gym environment, the action space is a discrete space representing all possible letter changes in the shared word. With a word length of `L` and 26 letters in the alphabet, each action is encoded as an integer in the range from `0` to `L*26-1`.

The action is decoded into two components:
- **Position** in the word: The integer division of the action by `26` gives the position (0-based index) in the shared word where the letter change will occur.
- **New Letter**: The modulus of the action by `26` gives the index of the new letter (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', ..., 25 for 'Z') that will replace the letter at the specified position.

Thus, each action uniquely specifies a single letter substitution in the shared word and is used to generate a new candidate word for the player's turn.
