The action space in the Number Conquest gym environment contains 18 discrete actions, corresponding to the possible moves a player can make during the game. Each index in the action space represents a combination of a chosen number and an action type. 

- Numbers range from 1 to 9, and each number has two associated actions: Attack (index 0) and Defend (index 1).

- A single action index is calculated by combining these two components: the number choice and the action type. The formula for converting an action index to a move is: `(number - 1) * 2 + action_type`, where `number` ranges from 1 to 9, and `action_type` is `0` for Attack and `1` for Defend.

- For example, choosing the number 3 to Attack corresponds to action index 4 ((3-1)*2 + 0), whereas choosing the number 3 to Defend corresponds to action index 5 ((3-1)*2 + 1).

This indexing system allows seamless conversion between action indices and game moves, effectively covering all possible number-action combinations with the 18 indices in the action space.
