In the gym environment for the game "Number Shove," the action space indices are mapped to game moves as follows: the action space consists of integers from 0 to 4, which correspond to actual moves of adding numbers 1 to 5 respectively. Concretely, if an agent selects an action i (where i is between 0 and 4), the actual number added to the running total is i + 1. This mapping allows the gym environment to use zero-based indexing common in programming while maintaining the game's rule of adding numbers from 1 to 5.
