In the game, the action space indices are mapped to moves as follows:

- Indices 0-4 correspond to attack values 1-5 (by adding 1 to the index).
- Index 5 corresponds to the "Block" action.
- Index 6 corresponds to the "Counter-Attack" action. 

This mapping allows players to choose attack values and defensive actions by selecting the appropriate index in the action space.
