**Title:** Palindrome Duel

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to create a numerical palindrome of at least three digits.

---

**Setup:**

- **Players:** Two players, Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Starting Condition:** Both players begin with an empty number.

---

**Game Components:**

- **Digits (1-9):** Players can choose any digit from 1 to 9. There is an unlimited supply of each digit.
- **Player Numbers:** Each player builds their own number individually.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.
2. **Actions During a Turn:**
   - **Select a Digit:** Choose any digit from 1 to 9.
   - **Placement:** Decide to add the chosen digit to the **front** or **back** of your current number.
3. **Progression:**
   - The game continues with players adding digits to their numbers until a palindrome is formed or the maximum length is reached.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Adding Digits:**
   - On your turn, you must add one digit (1-9) to your number.
   - You can place the digit at either the **front** or **back** of your number.
2. **Creating a Palindrome:**
   - A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 121, 1331, 12321).
   - To win, your palindrome must be at least **three digits** long.
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to form a palindrome of at least three digits wins immediately.
4. **Number Length Limit:**
   - A player's number cannot exceed **seven digits** in length.
   - If both players reach seven digits without forming a valid palindrome, the game is a **draw**.
5. **Digit Availability:**
   - Digits from 1 to 9 can be used multiple times by both players.
6. **Invalid Moves:**
   - Selecting a digit outside the range of 1 to 9 is invalid.
   - Exceeding the seven-digit limit results in an automatic loss.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Victory:** Achieved by being the first to form a valid palindrome of at least three digits.
- **Draw:** Occurs if both players reach the maximum number length without forming a palindrome.
