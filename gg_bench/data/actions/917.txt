In this environment, the action space consists of 9 discrete actions corresponding to the indices 0 through 8. Each action index maps directly to a digit in the sequence, where action `i` corresponds to removing the digit `i + 1` from the sequence. Thus, action 0 signifies removing digit 1, action 1 signifies removing digit 2, and so forth, up to action 8, which signifies removing digit 9.
