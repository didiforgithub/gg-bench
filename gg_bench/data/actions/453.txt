The action space indices 0-17 map to specific moves in the game where pairs of indices correspond to assigning a number from the pool to either the base or exponent of the current player's expression. Specifically, an even index `n` (0, 2, ..., 16) corresponds to assigning the number `n/2 + 1` to the base, and the next odd index `n+1` corresponds to assigning the same number `n/2 + 1` to the exponent. The index 18 represents the 'pass' action, which is only valid if the current player's expression is already complete.
