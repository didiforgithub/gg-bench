In this game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 8, corresponding to moves in the game where the player chooses a number from 1 to 9. Specifically, the action index 0 maps to selecting the number 1, index 1 maps to selecting the number 2, and so forth, up to index 8, which maps to selecting the number 9. This linear mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index to derive the actual game move.
