# Number Removal Duel

## Objective

**Number Removal Duel** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a numerical grid. The primary goal is to strategically remove numbers from the grid to force your opponent's total sum of removed numbers to reach or exceed **34**. The player whose total sum reaches or exceeds **34** loses the game. Skilled players can use strategic foresight to manipulate the available options and outmaneuver their opponent.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: Create a 4x4 grid representing the game board.
2. **Number Placement**: Fill the grid with numbers from **1** to **16** in sequential order, starting from the top-left cell and moving row by row to the bottom-right cell.
   ```
   [ 1 ][ 2 ][ 3 ][ 4 ]
   [ 5 ][ 6 ][ 7 ][ 8 ]
   [ 9 ][10 ][11 ][12 ]
   [13 ][14 ][15 ][16 ]
   ```
3. **Initial Conditions**: Both players start with a total sum of **0**.

## Game Components

- **Game Grid**: A 4x4 grid containing the numbers **1** to **16**.
- **Player Sums**: Each player keeps track of the sum of the numbers they have removed from the grid.
- **Available Numbers**: A visual or textual representation of the remaining numbers on the grid after each turn.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1) by mutual agreement or random selection.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - On their turn, a player selects **one** available number from the grid to remove.
   - The selected number is added to the player's total sum.
   - The number is then removed from the grid and is no longer available for future turns.
3. **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can choose **any** available number from the grid on their turn.
   - Each number can be removed only **once**.
2. **Sum Tracking**:
   - Each player maintains their own total sum of removed numbers.
   - The sums are updated after each turn.
3. **Winning Condition**:
   - **Loss Condition**: If a player's total sum reaches or exceeds **34** at the end of their turn, they **lose** the game.
   - **Winning Condition**: The opposing player wins if their own total sum is **less than 34** when the other player loses.
4. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. With careful play, one player will inevitably force the other to reach or exceed **34**.
5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players should aim to keep their own sum low while forcing the opponent to pick higher numbers.
   - Anticipate future moves to avoid being left with only high numbers.

## Scoring

- **Player Sum**: The score is the cumulative total of numbers a player has removed from the grid.
- **Victory Determination**: The player whose sum remains **below 34** when the opponent reaches or exceeds **34** is declared the **winner**.

Player 1 Sum: 1
Player 2 Sum: 16

Player 1, choose a number to remove:
```

*(The game continues in this manner until one player's sum reaches or exceeds 34.)*

## Strategic Tips

- **Control High Numbers**: Try to remove low numbers early, forcing your opponent to take higher numbers later in the game.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate which numbers will be left for your opponent on future turns.
- **Balance**: While keeping your sum low is important, sometimes removing a moderate number can prevent your opponent from accessing a low number on their next turn.
- **Forcing Moves**: Leave the grid in a state where only high numbers are available to your opponent.
