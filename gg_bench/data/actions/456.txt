The action space indices (0-8) correspond directly to selecting numbers from the shared pool of numbers ranging from 1 to 9 in the game. Specifically, action index `0` represents selecting the number `1`, index `1` represents selecting the number `2`, and so forth, up to action index `8`, which represents selecting the number `9`. This alignment means that each action index directly maps to its respective number in order.
