In the gym environment for the "Battle of Numbers" game, the action space indices map to the possible player moves as follows: Index 0 corresponds to the "Attack" action, where a player uses the drawn card's value to reduce the opponent's Life Points. Index 1 corresponds to the "Heal" action, where a player uses the drawn card's value to increase their own Life Points, up to a maximum of 20.
