In the provided gym environment, the action space is defined as a `Discrete(9)`, which maps the action space indices (0 to 8) to the game's possible moves, which are the numbers from 1 to 9. This mapping is achieved by offsetting the index by 1, such that an action space index of `i` corresponds to the move of selecting the number `i + 1` in the game.
