In the gym environment for the Number Tower game, the action space is represented by discrete indices ranging from 0 to 8. Each index corresponds directly to selecting a block numbered from 1 to 9 for placement in the game. Specifically, action index `i` maps to placing the block with number `i + 1`. For example, action index 0 corresponds to placing the block numbered 1, action index 1 corresponds to placing block 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which corresponds to placing block 9.
