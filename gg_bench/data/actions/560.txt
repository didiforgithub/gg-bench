In the "Number Factor" game environment, the action space indices (0 to 19) correspond to the numbers 1 to 20, respectively. Selecting an action with index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 19) in the environment signifies choosing the number `i + 1` as the player's move. This mapping allows players to perform actions representing their choice of numbers from the range of 1 to 20, with each index directly translating to its corresponding number in the game.
