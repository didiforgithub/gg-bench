# Gridlock Game Rule Book

## Objective

**Gridlock** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a 4x4 grid. The primary goal is to outmaneuver your opponent by placing your markers on the grid and blocking them from making a legal move. The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot place a marker without violating the game's placement rules wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Game Grid**: The game is played on a 4x4 grid consisting of 16 cells arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns.
2. **Markers**:
   - **Player 1** uses markers represented by "X".
   - **Player 2** uses markers represented by "O".
3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - The grid starts empty with all cells unoccupied.
   - Decide who will be Player 1 and Player 2. This can be determined by agreement or a random method such as flipping a coin.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 4x4 grid displayed in the command-line interface. Each cell is identified by its row and column numbers (ranging from 1 to 4).
- **Markers**:
  - "X" for Player 1.
  - "O" for Player 2.
- **Empty Cells**: Represented by "." or a blank space in the grid display.
- **Command Inputs**: Players input their moves by specifying the row and column numbers of the cell where they wish to place their marker.

## Turns

- The game proceeds in alternating turns starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Grid**: The current state of the grid is displayed.
  2. **Player Input**: The current player inputs the coordinates (row and column) of an empty cell where they wish to place their marker.
  3. **Validation**: The game checks if the move is legal according to the rules.
     - If the move is legal, the marker is placed, and the turn ends.
     - If the move is illegal, the player is prompted to input a different move.
  4. **Check for Game End**: After each move, the game checks if the opponent has any legal moves remaining.
     - If the opponent cannot make a legal move, the current player wins.
     - If the opponent can make a move, the next turn begins.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Placement Rules

1. **Marker Placement**:
   - Players can place their marker on any empty cell that is **not adjacent** (horizontally or vertically) to any of the opponent's markers.
   - Diagonal adjacency is allowed; only horizontal and vertical adjacency to an opponent's marker is prohibited.
2. **Adjacency Definition**:
   - Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side (not including corners).
   - For example, if Player 2 has a marker on cell (2,3), Player 1 cannot place a marker on cells (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), or (3,3).

### Move Validation

- A move is considered legal if:
  - The chosen cell is within the bounds of the grid (rows and columns between 1 and 4).
  - The chosen cell is empty.
  - The chosen cell is not adjacent to any of the opponent's existing markers (excluding diagonal adjacency).

- If a player has no legal moves available on their turn, they lose the game.

### Game End Conditions

- **Victory**: A player wins if their opponent has no legal moves to make on their turn.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite number of cells and the placement rules.

## Scoring

- **Win**: The winning player is declared the victor of the game.
- **Loss**: The losing player is the one who cannot make a legal move on their turn.
- **No Points or Accumulated Score**: This game does not use a point or scoring system beyond determining the winner and loser of each game.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Grid State

All cells are empty.

```
    1   2   3   4
  +---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Player 1 places an "X" at cell (2,2).
- **Move Validation**: Cell (2,2) is empty and not adjacent to any opponent's markers (since none exist yet).
- **Grid State**:

```
    1   2   3   4
  +---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
2 |   | X |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Player 2 attempts to place an "O" at cell (2,3).
- **Move Validation**:
  - Cell (2,3) is adjacent to Player 1's marker at (2,2).
  - **Invalid Move**: Player 2 cannot place a marker adjacent to an opponent's marker.
- **Player 2's Second Attempt**:
  - **Action**: Player 2 places an "O" at cell (3,3).
  - **Move Validation**: Cell (3,3) is not adjacent horizontally or vertically to any of Player 1's markers.
- **Grid State**:

```
    1   2   3   4
  +---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
2 |   | X |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   | O |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Player 1 attempts to place an "X" at cell (3,2).
- **Move Validation**:
  - Cell (3,2) is adjacent to Player 2's marker at (3,3).
  - **Invalid Move**: Cannot place adjacent to opponent's marker.
- **Player 1's Second Attempt**:
  - **Action**: Player 1 places an "X" at cell (1,1).
  - **Move Validation**: Valid move.
- **Grid State**:

```
    1   2   3   4
  +---+---+---+---+
1 | X |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
2 |   | X |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   | O |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

#### Subsequent Turns

- Players continue following the rules, carefully choosing positions that are not adjacent to the opponent's markers.
- As the grid fills up, options become limited.
- **Endgame Scenario**:

Suppose it's Player 2's turn, and the only remaining empty cells are adjacent to Player 1's markers. Player 2 has no legal moves.

- **Outcome**: Player 1 wins because Player 2 cannot make a legal move.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

- **Prompt**: "Player 1 (X), it's your turn. Enter your move (row and column):"
- **Player Input**: `2 2`

#### Move Validation

- **Output**: "You placed an 'X' at position (2,2)."

#### Display Grid

```
    1   2   3   4
  +---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+

  +---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+
```

#### Invalid Move Attempt

- **Prompt**: "Player 2 (O), it's your turn. Enter your move (row and column):"
- **Player Input**: `2 3`
- **Output**: "Invalid move. You cannot place next to an opponent's marker. Please choose a different cell."

#### Valid Move

- **Player Input**: `3 3`
- **Output**: "You placed an 'O' at position (3,3)."

#### Game Conclusion

- **Prompt**: "Player 1 (X), it's your turn. Enter your move (row and column):"
- **Player Input**: [No legal moves available]
- **Output**: "Player 1 has no legal moves remaining. Player 2 (O) wins the game!"

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's potential moves and aim to limit their options.
- **Control the Center**: Placing markers near the center early on can maximize your own options while restricting your opponent.
- **Avoid Isolation**: Keep your markers spread out to maintain multiple areas for potential placement.
- **Force Moves**: Try to guide your opponent into areas where their options will become limited more quickly.
