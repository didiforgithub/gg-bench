In the CustomEnv environment, the action space is a discrete space with 49 possible actions, corresponding to selecting numbers from 2 to 50. Each action index maps to a number as follows: action index 0 corresponds to the number 2, action index 1 corresponds to the number 3, and so on up to action index 48, which corresponds to the number 50. This mapping is achieved by adding 2 to the action index to determine the selected number in the game.
