In the provided gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 14) are mapped to moves in the game by corresponding directly to the numbers in the game pool (1 to 15). Specifically, action index 0 refers to selecting the number 1, index 1 refers to selecting number 2, and so on up to index 14 referring to selecting number 15. This mapping allows the agent to select a number from the pool by choosing an action index, resulting in the removal of that number from play.
