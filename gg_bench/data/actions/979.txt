In the game environment, the action space indices are mapped to the allowed mathematical operations as follows:

- **Action 0:** Add 1 (`current_number = current_number + 1`)
- **Action 1:** Subtract 1 (`current_number = current_number - 1`)
- **Action 2:** Multiply by 2 (`current_number = current_number * 2`)
- **Action 3:** Divide by 2 (`current_number = current_number / 2`), allowed only if `current_number` is even.
