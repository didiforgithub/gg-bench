In the Sum Fifteen Challenge gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 actions, corresponding to selecting one of the numbers from 1 to 9. The action space indices (0 to 8) map directly to the numbers (1 to 9) by adding 1 to the index. Thus, choosing an action with index `i` means selecting the number `i + 1` from the number pool.
