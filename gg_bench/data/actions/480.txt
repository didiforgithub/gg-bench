In the game, the action space indices map directly to the numbers available in the game. Each index from 0 to 24 corresponds to a number from 1 to 25, respectively. When a player selects an action with a specific index, they are essentially choosing to claim the number that matches the index plus one. For example, choosing action index 0 means the player claims the number 1, and choosing action index 24 means the player claims the number 25.
