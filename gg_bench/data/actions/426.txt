In the `CustomEnv` Gym environment for the **Factor Duel** game, the action space is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to `starting_number`. Each action corresponds to subtracting a proper divisor of the current number (i.e., a positive integer less than the current number that divides it evenly). Therefore, when a player selects an action, it represents the index of a valid move where they subtract a specific proper divisor from the current number. Valid moves are determined by those indices in the range that satisfy the proper divisor condition of the current number.
