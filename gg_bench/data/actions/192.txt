The action space indices in the game correspond to an ordered list of prime numbers up to the starting number N. Each index represents a specific prime number from this list. When a player selects an index as their action, they are choosing to divide the current number N by the prime number at that index in the list. The mapping allows players to perform valid moves by selecting a prime factor of N, represented as an action index in the game environment.
