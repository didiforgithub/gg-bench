The action space indices, ranging from 0 to 8, directly correspond to positions on the 3x3 grid, with each index representing one of the unclaimed cells where a player can claim a number. The indices map to the grid in row-major order, i.e.,:

- Index 0: Top-left cell (1st row, 1st column)
- Index 1: Top-middle cell (1st row, 2nd column)
- Index 2: Top-right cell (1st row, 3rd column)
- Index 3: Middle-left cell (2nd row, 1st column)
- Index 4: Center cell (2nd row, 2nd column)
- Index 5: Middle-right cell (2nd row, 3rd column)
- Index 6: Bottom-left cell (3rd row, 1st column)
- Index 7: Bottom-middle cell (3rd row, 2nd column)
- Index 8: Bottom-right cell (3rd row, 3rd column)

This mapping means that when a player selects an action with a specific index, they are choosing the corresponding unclaimed number from the grid based on this order.
