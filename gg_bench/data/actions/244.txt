In the "Digit Duel" game environment, the action space consists of discrete choices represented by digits 0 through 9. Each action space index directly corresponds to the respective digit, which can be subtracted from the current player's target number. Thus, the action taken in the game involves selecting a digit from the opponent's number (accessible as actions 0-9) to perform the subtraction, provided it is a valid move.
