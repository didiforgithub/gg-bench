In the game, each action is represented by an index from 0 to 80 in the action space, which corresponds to both the number a player chooses and the position on the grid where they place it. The action index is calculated as `(number_index * 9) + position_index`. Here's the breakdown:

- `number_index`: An integer between 0 and 8 representing the number from 1 to 9. The actual number is obtained by `number_index + 1`.
- `position_index`: An integer between 0 and 8 representing a position on the 3x3 grid. The grid positions are arranged linearly as (0,0) to (2,2) translated to indices 0 to 8.

Thus, each action index uniquely maps a choice of number and a grid position on which to place that number.
