In the described Gym environment for the game "Digit Duel," the action space is represented by indices ranging from 0 to 10, where each index corresponds to a specific move:

- **Indices 0-9**: These indices allow players to select a digit from the shared pool. Each index directly represents the respective digit (e.g., index 0 corresponds to selecting the digit 0, index 1 corresponds to selecting the digit 1, and so on up to index 9).
- **Index 10**: This index is used to declare victory. It lets a player announce that they have formed a valid three-digit number divisible by seven, assuming they have already picked three digits in their hand.
