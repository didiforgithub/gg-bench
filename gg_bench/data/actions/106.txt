In the gym environment for Strategy Stacks, the action space is defined as `Discrete(9)`, which represents numbers 1 through 9 in the game. Each action corresponds to selecting one of these numbers, with action indices ranging from 0 to 8. Specifically, an action index `i` maps to the in-game number `i + 1`. For example, action `0` corresponds to selecting number `1`, action `1` corresponds to selecting number `2`, and so forth up to action `8`, which maps to selecting number `9`. Each index in the action space is a potential move a player can make by selecting the corresponding number from the available list.
