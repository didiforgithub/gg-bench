In the given gym environment, the action space indices are mapped to combinations of a secret move and an opponent's guess as follows:

- Index 0: Secret move is 1 step forward and the opponent's guess is 1.
- Index 1: Secret move is 1 step forward and the opponent's guess is 2.
- Index 2: Secret move is 2 steps forward and the opponent's guess is 1.
- Index 3: Secret move is 2 steps forward and the opponent's guess is 2.

Each action index represents one specific combination of the secret move and the opponent's guess that the active player can choose.
