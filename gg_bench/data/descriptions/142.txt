# Multiplication Madness: Rule Book

## Objective

**Multiplication Madness** is a two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to reach or exceed a target number by multiplying a shared total. The primary goal is simple:

- **Be the first player to reach or exceed the target number (100) by multiplying the current total by a number between 2 and 9 on your turn.**

Victory is achieved by strategic choices of multipliers, anticipating the opponent's moves, and planning ahead to control the flow of the game.

## Setup

1. **Initial Total**: The game begins with a **current total of 1**.
2. **Target Number**: The goal is to reach or surpass **100**.
3. **Players**: Two players decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

No physical components are required beyond a method for tracking the current total and for inputting player choices, making it ideal for a command-line interface.

## Game Components

- **Current Total**: An integer representing the cumulative product of players' multipliers, starting at **1**.
- **Target Number**: Set at **100**; this is the threshold players aim to reach or exceed to win.
- **Allowed Multipliers**: Integers from **2** to **9** inclusive.
- **Players**: Two participants alternating turns.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Multiplier Selection**: On your turn, choose a multiplier between **2** and **9**.
2. **Calculation**: Multiply the current total by your chosen multiplier.
3. **Update Total**: The result becomes the new current total.
4. **Turn Completion**: The turn passes to the other player.

### Order of Actions

- **Player 1** takes the first turn.
- **Player 2** follows.
- Turns alternate until the game ends.

### Actions Allowed per Turn

- **Choose Multiplier**: Select any integer from **2** to **9**.
- **No Skipping**: Players must play on their turn; skipping is not allowed.
- **No Repeats Constraint**: There is no restriction on reusing multipliers; any allowed multiplier can be chosen on any turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

- **Multiplier Range**: Players must choose a multiplier between **2** and **9** (inclusive).
- **Valid Moves**: Only multiplication by the selected multiplier is allowed; no other operations.
- **Winning the Game**: The first player to bring the current total to **100** or more on their turn wins.
- **Exact Target Not Required**: Surpassing the target number (going over 100) is acceptable.

### Special Conditions

- **No Backtracking**: Once the current total is updated, it cannot be reduced or altered except by multiplication on a player's turn.
- **No Draws**: Given the structure and rules, a draw is impossible; the game will always result in a win for one player.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Consider how your multiplier choice will set up the opponent's next move.
- **Control the Pace**: Aim to force the opponent into positions where they have no winning moves.
- **Planning Ahead**: Advanced planning can help in creating a path to victory.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who reaches or exceeds the target number (100) on their turn wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no point accumulation; the game is won by meeting the objective.

## Examples

### Sample Game Playthrough

**Starting the Game**

- Current Total: **1**
- Target Number: **100**

**Player Turns**

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses multiplier: **5**
   - Calculation: 1 × 5 = **5**
   - Current Total: **5**

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Chooses multiplier: **6**
   - Calculation: 5 × 6 = **30**
   - Current Total: **30**

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Chooses multiplier: **3**
   - Calculation: 30 × 3 = **90**
   - Current Total: **90**

4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Chooses multiplier: **2**
   - Calculation: 90 × 2 = **180**
   - Current Total: **180**

**Conclusion**

- **Player 2** has reached **180**, exceeding the target number of **100**.
- **Player 2 wins the game!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start!
Current Total is 1.
Target Number is 100.

Player 1, enter a multiplier (2-9): 5
You chose 5.
Current Total is now 5.

Player 2, enter a multiplier (2-9): 6
You chose 6.
Current Total is now 30.

Player 1, enter a multiplier (2-9): 3
You chose 3.
Current Total is now 90.

Player 2, enter a multiplier (2-9): 2
You chose 2.
Current Total is now 180.

Player 2 has reached or exceeded the target number!
Player 2 wins the game!
```

### Strategic Depth Example

Consider a scenario where players think ahead to control the game:

- **Player 1's Turn**
  - Current Total: 1
  - Chooses multiplier: **2**
  - Current Total becomes **2**

- **Player 2's Turn**
  - Chooses multiplier: **9**
  - Current Total becomes **18**

- **Player 1's Turn**
  - Chooses multiplier: **5**
  - Current Total becomes **90**

- **Player 2's Turn**
  - Has limited options to avoid setting up Player 1 for a win.
  - Any choice will result in Player 1 being able to reach or exceed 100 on the next turn.

## Summary

**Multiplication Madness** is a straightforward yet strategically rich game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent. With simple rules and quick gameplay, it offers both accessibility for beginners and depth for seasoned players.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
