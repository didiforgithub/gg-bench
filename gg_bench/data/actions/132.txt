In the gym environment for the Sum Trap game, the action space indices (0 to 9) map directly to the numbers (1 to 10) that a player can select from the number pool. Action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 9 which corresponds to selecting the number 10. Each index specifies selecting the (index + 1)-th number from the pool.
