# Binary Battle: Rule Book

## Objective

**Binary Battle** is a two-player turn-based strategy game. The primary goal is to be the first player to set all bits in your 4-bit binary number to `1` (i.e., achieve `1111`). Players can flip bits in their own number and reset bits in their opponent's number, adding strategic depth to the gameplay. The first player to reach `1111` wins the game; if a player cannot make a valid move, they lose.

---

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players
- **Starting Condition**: 
  - Each player begins with a 4-bit binary number initialized to `0000`.
- **Decide Turn Order**:
  - Flip a coin or have each player enter a number; the system can randomly select who goes first.

## Game Components

- **Binary Numbers**:
  - Each player has their own 4-bit binary number displayed as `b3b2b1b0`, where each `b` represents a bit.
  - The bits are ordered from left (most significant bit, `b3`) to right (least significant bit, `b0`).

- **Actions**:
  - **Flip Own Bit**: Change one of your own bits from `0` to `1`.
  - **Reset Opponent's Bit**: Change one of your opponent's bits from `1` to `0`.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - On your turn, you must perform one of the available actions.

- **Available Actions on a Turn**:
  1. **Flip Own Bit**:
     - Choose any of your bits that is set to `0` and flip it to `1`.
  2. **Reset Opponent's Bit**:
     - Choose any of your opponent's bits that is set to `1` and reset it to `0`.

- **Progression of Turns**:
  - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player wins or cannot make a valid move.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Flipping Bits**:
   - You can only flip your own bits from `0` to `1`.
   - You cannot flip a bit that is already `1`.

2. **Resetting Opponent's Bits**:
   - You can reset your opponent's bits from `1` to `0`.
   - You cannot reset a bit that is already `0`.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have all their bits set to `1` (`1111`) wins the game immediately.

4. **Valid Moves**:
   - If a player has no valid moves (i.e., all their bits are `1` and the opponent's bits are all `0`), they lose their turn.
   - If both players have no valid moves, the game ends, and the player with more bits set to `1` wins.
   - If both players have the same number of bits set to `1`, the player who last made a move wins.
