In the game environment, each action corresponds to a subtraction of a positive divisor from the current number. The action space indices (ranging from 0 to `max_number`) represent potential divisor values. To make a valid move, a player should select an action index corresponding to a valid divisor of the current number, based on the parity requirement. If the parity requirement is 0, any divisor can be chosen; if the requirement is 1, choose an even divisor; if -1, choose an odd divisor. Each selected action (divisor) is subtracted from the current number to progress the game.
