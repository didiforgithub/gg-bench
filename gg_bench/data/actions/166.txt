In the gym environment for the "Randomizer Challenge" game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with two indices:

- Action 0 corresponds to the move "Add," where a random integer between 1 and 10 is generated and added to the player's score.
- Action 1 corresponds to the move "Multiply," where a random integer between 2 and 5 is generated and used to multiply the player's score.
