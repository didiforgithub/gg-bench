# Code Breaker Duel

**Objective:**

Become the first player to correctly guess your opponent's secret code. Use logic and deduction based on feedback from each guess to unveil the opponent's code before they discover yours.

---

**Setup:**

1. **Secret Code Selection:**
   - Each player privately selects a secret three-digit code.
   - Each digit in the code can be any number from **1** to **5**.
   - **Digits may repeat** (e.g., `3-3-1` or `5-5-5` are valid codes).

2. **Preparation:**
   - Players should have a way to record guesses and feedback (e.g., paper and pencil or a text editor).
   - Establish who will take the first turn (coin toss, agreement, etc.).

---

**Game Components:**

- **Digits (1-5):** The numbers used to create secret codes and make guesses.
- **Secret Codes:** Three-digit numbers created by each player.
- **Feedback Indicators:**
  - **Hits:** Correct digits in the correct positions.
  - **Blows:** Correct digits in incorrect positions.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Guessing Phase:**
   - On your turn, **guess a three-digit code** you think might be your opponent's secret code.
   - Announce your guess to your opponent.

2. **Feedback Phase:**
   - After a guess is made, the opponent provides feedback:
     - **Hits:** State the number of digits that are correct and in the correct position.
     - **Blows:** State the number of digits that are correct but in the wrong position.
   - Example feedback: "1 Hit, 2 Blows"

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - Players alternate turns, each making a guess and receiving feedback.
   - Use the feedback from each guess to refine subsequent guesses.
   - Continue until one player correctly guesses the opponent's secret code.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Code Validity:**
   - Codes must be exactly three digits long.
   - Each digit must be between **1** and **5**.
   - Digits can repeat or be unique.

2. **Making a Guess:**
   - Guesses must also be three-digit numbers using digits from **1** to **5**.
   - Announce your guess clearly to your opponent.

3. **Providing Feedback:**
   - For each guess, the opponent must provide accurate feedback:
     - **Hits:**
       - Count of digits that match in both **number and position**.
     - **Blows:**
       - Count of digits that are correct in **number but not in the correct position**.
   - **No additional hints** or information should be given.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to receive feedback indicating **"3 Hits"** wins the game.
   - This means they have correctly guessed all three digits in their correct positions.
   - The game ends immediately when a correct code is guessed.

5. **Honesty and Integrity:**
   - Players must provide truthful feedback.
   - Misrepresenting hits and blows is considered cheating and invalidates the game.

---

**Scoring:**

- The game is won by the first player to correctly guess the opponent's secret code.
- No points are tracked; it is a win/loss outcome.
- Players may choose to play multiple rounds and keep track of wins to determine an overall champion.

**Examples:**

**Example Game Play**

*Assume Player 1's secret code is `3-1-4`, and Player 2's secret code is `1-5-1`.*

---

**Round 1:**

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - **Guess:** `1-1-1`
  - **Player 2's Feedback:** `1 Hit, 0 Blows`
    - (One of the `1`s is in the correct position.)

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - **Guess:** `2-2-2`
  - **Player 1's Feedback:** `0 Hits, 0 Blows`

---

**Round 2:**

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - **Guess:** `1-5-1`
  - **Player 2's Feedback:** `1 Hit, 1 Blow`
    - (The `1` in the first position is a hit; the `5` or the second `1` is a blow.)

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - **Guess:** `3-1-2`
  - **Player 1's Feedback:** `2 Hits, 0 Blows`
    - (`3` and `1` are hits.)

---

**Round 3:**

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - **Guess:** `1-5-3`
  - **Player 2's Feedback:** `0 Hits, 2 Blows`
    - (Two digits are correct but in the wrong positions.)

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - **Guess:** `3-1-4`
  - **Player 1's Feedback:** `3 Hits, 0 Blows`
    - **Player 2 wins the game by correctly guessing Player 1's code.**

**Strategic Tips:**

- **Use Feedback Wisely:** Keep track of all feedback received to narrow down possible codes.
- **Eliminate Possibilities:** Use guesses to eliminate numbers and positions.
- **Deductive Reasoning:** If a digit is a hit or a blow, consider its placement in future guesses.
- **Pay Attention to Repeats:** Remember that digits can repeat, so consider that in your guesses.
- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate possible codes your opponent might have based on their feedback to your guesses.
