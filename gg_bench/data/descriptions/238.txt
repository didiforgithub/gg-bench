# Sevens Challenge

## Objective

The primary goal of **Sevens Challenge** is to be the first player to transform the current two-digit number into a **multiple of 7** by altering **one digit** of the number on your turn. Players take turns modifying the number, and the first to create a multiple of 7 wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a random two-digit number that is **not** a multiple of 7. This number is displayed to both players.

2. **Player Assignment**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. The starting player can be decided by mutual agreement or randomly (e.g., coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A two-digit integer displayed in the command-line interface.

- **Digits**:
  - **Tens Digit**: The first digit of the number (cannot be zero).
  - **Ones Digit**: The second digit of the number.

- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2**: Participants who take turns modifying the number.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - On your turn, you must:
     - Choose **either** the tens digit **or** the ones digit to change.
     - Replace the chosen digit with any digit from **0 to 9** (tens digit cannot be zero).
   - **Example**: Changing the ones digit of 23 from 3 to 8 results in the number 28.

3. **Updating the Number**:
   - After the digit change, the new number is displayed.
   - The turn passes to the next player.

4. **Restrictions**:
   - **Only one digit** can be changed per turn.
   - The **tens digit cannot be changed to zero** (the number must remain two-digit).
   - The new number must be a valid two-digit integer (10-99).

---

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Moves**:
  - Change exactly one digit (tens or ones) to a new digit (0-9).
  - Ensure the tens digit remains between 1 and 9 after your move.

- **Invalid Moves**:
  - Changing both digits in one turn.
  - Changing the tens digit to zero.
  - Not changing any digit.
  - Creating a number less than 10 or greater than 99.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to create a number that is a **multiple of 7** wins.
  - Multiples of 7 in two-digit numbers include: 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98.

- **Forfeiting a Turn**:
  - If a player makes an invalid move, they forfeit their turn.
  - The opponent gets the opportunity to make a move immediately.

- **No Draws**:
  - The game continues indefinitely until a player wins.
  - Given the finite number of two-digit numbers, a win is guaranteed.

## Strategy Tips

- **Know Your Multiples**: Familiarize yourself with two-digit multiples of 7 (14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98).

- **Plan Ahead**: Think about how changing a digit will set you up for a win or prevent your opponent from winning on their next turn.

- **Block Opponents**: If you can't win on your turn, try to alter the number to make it harder for your opponent to win on theirs.

- **Tens vs. Ones**: Consider which digit change gives you or your opponent the best chance of reaching a multiple of 7.
