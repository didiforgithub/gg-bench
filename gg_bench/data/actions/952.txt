The action space indices map to the number of positions a player chooses to move forward on their turn as follows: 

- Action index **0** corresponds to moving **1** step forward.
- Action index **1** corresponds to moving **2** steps forward.
- Action index **2** corresponds to moving **3** steps forward.
