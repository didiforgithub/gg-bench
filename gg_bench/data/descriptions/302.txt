# Digit Conquest: Rule Book

## Objective

**Digit Conquest** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to reach **exactly 50 points**. Players accumulate points by drawing digits and deciding whether to add to their score or subtract from their opponent's score. Strategic choices and foresight are key to victory.

## Setup

1. **Shared Deck**: Create a shared deck consisting of digits from **1 to 9**, with each digit appearing **four times**. This results in a deck of **36 cards**.
2. **Player Scores**: Both players start with a personal score of **0**.
3. **Game Start**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Deck of Digits (1-9)**: Each digit (1 through 9) appears four times, totaling 36 cards.
  - **Appearance**: Each card simply displays a single digit from 1 to 9.
  - **Functionality**: Digits are used to adjust player scores.
- **Player Scores**: A numerical value representing each player's current total, starting at 0.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players interact with the game by entering commands to draw cards and adjust scores.

## Turns

1. **Drawing a Card**:
   - At the beginning of your turn, **draw a digit** from the shared deck.
   - The draw can be **random** or, if coding allows, the player can **choose** from available digits.
2. **Action Options**:
   - **Option 1**: **Add** the drawn digit to your own score.
   - **Option 2**: **Subtract** the drawn digit from your opponent's score.
     - Your opponent's score **cannot go below zero**.
3. **End of Turn**:
   - After performing one of the above actions, the turn passes to the other player.
4. **Deck Depletion**:
   - If the deck runs out of cards before either player reaches 50, reshuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Moves**:
  - You **cannot** make a move that would cause your own score to exceed **50**.
  - If adding a digit to your score would exceed 50, you **must** subtract it from your opponent's score.
  - If neither adding to your score nor subtracting from your opponent's score is possible (e.g., both scores are in positions where they cannot be adjusted with the drawn digit), **discard** the digit and end your turn.
- **Score Limits**:
  - A player's score **cannot exceed 50**.
  - A player's score **cannot go below 0**.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to reach **exactly 50 points** wins the game.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game continues until one player reaches exactly 50 points; there are no draws.
- **Strategic Play**:
  - Players must decide when it's more advantageous to boost their own score or hinder their opponent's progress.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Scores**:
  - Keep a running total of each player's score after every turn.
  - Scores should be clearly displayed after each action for both players.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - Monitor each player's score to check for the winning condition (exactly 50 points) at the **end of every turn**.
