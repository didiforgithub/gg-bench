In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space indices (ranging from 0 to 9) directly correspond to the switch indices in the game, which are numbered 1 to 10. When a player chooses an action `i`, it toggles the switch at position `i + 1` from OFF to ON. This mapping is straightforward: action index `0` for switch 1, action index `1` for switch 2, and so on, up to action index `9` for switch 10.
