The action space indices (0 to 9) correspond directly to the numbers 1 to 10 in the game. Specifically, an action with index `i` selects the number `i + 1` from the pool. Each index uniquely identifies a number from the shared pool, and once selected, that number is marked and becomes unavailable for subsequent turns.
