In the provided gym environment for the game "Prime Time," the action space consists of discrete indices corresponding to prime numbers within a pre-defined list of primes up to 100. Each action index is directly mapped to a prime number. When a player selects an action, they are effectively choosing a prime factor from this list by using its index, which is then used to divide the current number in the game. This mapping allows players to execute valid gameplay moves by selecting the appropriate index for the desired prime factor.
