# Dividers: The Ultimate Numerical Showdown

## Objective

**Dividers** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where players race to reduce a starting number, known as the **Pile**, to exactly **1**. The primary goal is to be the player who successfully reduces the Pile to **1** by dividing it with carefully chosen divisors. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose the game. The game demands foresight and strategic planning, ensuring that a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled opponent.

## Setup

- **Starting Pile**: The game begins with the Pile set to **100**.
- **Players**: Two players will alternate turns. Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Player 1 makes the first move.
- **Interface**: The game is played in a command-line interface where players input their chosen divisors when prompted.

## Game Components

- **Pile**: A shared number that players will manipulate throughout the game. It starts at **100** and changes based on players' moves.
- **Divisors**: Whole numbers greater than **1** that players select to divide the current Pile. Divisors must meet specific criteria detailed in the rules.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The medium through which players input their moves and receive game updates.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  1. **Valid Divisor Selection**: The player selects a valid divisor based on the current Pile.
  2. **Pile Update**: The Pile is divided by the chosen divisor, and the result becomes the new Pile value.
  3. **Display**: The game displays the new Pile value and prompts the next player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Valid Divisors

On each turn, the player must choose a divisor (**D**) that adheres to the following rules:

1. **Whole Number Greater Than 1**: \( D > 1 \).
2. **Divides Evenly Into the Pile**: The Pile divided by \( D \) must result in a whole number with no remainder.
3. **Less Than Current Pile**: \( D < \) current Pile value.
4. **Less Than or Equal to Half of the Pile**: \( D \leq \frac{\text{current Pile}}{2} \).

### Pile Reduction

- **Updating the Pile**: After a valid divisor is chosen, the Pile is updated by dividing it by \( D \):
  \[
  \text{New Pile} = \frac{\text{Current Pile}}{D}
  \]
- **Valid Moves Only**: If the player cannot find a valid divisor on their turn, they lose the game.

### Winning the Game

- **Achieving Pile of 1**: The player who reduces the Pile to exactly **1** wins the game.
- **Opponent's Inability to Move**: If a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot find a valid divisor that meets all criteria), they lose, and their opponent wins.

### Additional Rules

- **No Repeats on the Same Pile Value**: If the Pile returns to a previous value during the game, all previous moves remain valid as long as the divisor rules are followed.
- **No Skipping Turns**: Players must make a valid move on their turn if possible.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game is determined by a win or loss outcome without points.
- **Tracking Wins**: Players may choose to play multiple rounds and keep track of the number of games won.

## Examples

### Example 1: Strategic Play

**Starting Pile**: 100

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Possible Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50 (divisors of 100 that are ≤50)
- **Choice**: Player 1 selects **D = 4**.
- **Pile Update**: \( \frac{100}{4} = 25 \)
- **New Pile**: 25

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Possible Divisors**: 5 (since \( \frac{25}{2} = 12.5 \), divisors must be ≤12)
- **Choice**: Player 2 selects **D = 5**.
- **Pile Update**: \( \frac{25}{5} = 5 \)
- **New Pile**: 5

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Possible Divisors**: None (since divisors must be >1 and ≤2.5)
- **Outcome**: Player 1 cannot make a valid move and loses.
- **Winner**: Player 2

### Example 2: Extended Play

**Starting Pile**: 100

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Choice**: **D = 2**
- **New Pile**: \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Choice**: **D = 5**
- **New Pile**: \( \frac{50}{5} = 10 \)

#### Player 1's Turn

- **Choice**: **D = 2**
- **New Pile**: \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)

#### Player 2's Turn

- **Possible Divisors**: None (since \( D \leq \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \), and 2 does not divide 5 evenly)
- **Outcome**: Player 2 cannot make a valid move and loses.
- **Winner**: Player 1

## Command-Line Interaction

### Sample Turn

```
Current Pile: 100
Player 1, enter your divisor: 4
You chose 4. New Pile is 25.

Current Pile: 25
Player 2, enter your divisor: 5
You chose 5. New Pile is 5.

Current Pile: 5
Player 1, enter your divisor: 
No valid divisors available. You lose!
Player 2 wins the game!
```

### Valid Move Prompt

- The game may assist players by listing possible valid divisors on their turn.

### Invalid Move Handling

- If a player enters an invalid divisor, the game will prompt them to choose again:
  ```
  Invalid divisor. Please select a whole number greater than 1, less than the current Pile, divides evenly into the Pile, and is less than or equal to half of the Pile.
  ```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future Pile values to force your opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **Reduce Options**: Choose divisors that limit the next player's possible moves.
- **Control the Pile**: Aim for Pile values that have fewer divisors, increasing the chance your opponent cannot make a valid move.
