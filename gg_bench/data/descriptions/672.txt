## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

1. **Choosing Move Numbers**:
   - On your turn, select any number from **1 to 9** to add to your current step.
   - Example: If you're on Step 4 and choose **5**, you'll move to Step 9.

2. **Staircase Limits**:
   - You cannot move beyond **Step 20**.
   - If a chosen move number would take you past Step 20, the move is invalid; choose a different number.

3. **Occupied Steps**:
   - Players cannot occupy the same step.
   - If your calculated step is occupied by your opponent, the move is invalid; select a different number.

### Prime Number Bonus

- **Prime Steps**:
  - After moving, if you land on a **prime-numbered step**, you earn an **extra turn**.
  - Prime numbers between 1 and 20: **2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19**.

- **Extra Turn Rules**:
  - Extra turns are immediate.
  - There is no limit to the number of consecutive extra turns.
  - Each extra turn follows the same rules as a regular turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to land exactly on **Step 20** wins the game.
- **Invalid Moves**:
  - If a player has no valid moves (all possible moves either exceed Step 20 or land on the opponent's step), they must pass their turn.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Progress**:
  - Each player's current step number represents their progress.
  - No points are accumulated; the goal is to reach Step 20.
