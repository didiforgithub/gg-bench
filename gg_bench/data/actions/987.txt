In the provided gym environment for the game "Bid Battle," each action space index represents a specific bid amount. The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(100)`, meaning there are 100 discrete actions corresponding to possible bid values. An action selected by the player (ranging from 0 to 99) is mapped to a bid amount by adding 1. Therefore, an action index of 0 corresponds to a bid of 1 point, an index of 1 corresponds to a bid of 2 points, and so on, up to an action index of 99 corresponding to a bid of 100 points. This mapping ensures that all bid values from 1 to 100 are represented.
