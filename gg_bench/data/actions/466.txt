The action space index in the game maps to the player's moves as follows:

- Actions are represented as two-digit numbers, with the first digit (0-4) indicating the index of the shadow (0 for the first shadow, 1 for the second, etc.) and the second digit (0-9) indicating the specific action to be taken.
- The second digit represents:
  - `0`: Rest (do nothing).
  - `1`: Move up (if energy is ≥ 1).
  - `2`: Move down (if energy is ≥ 1).
  - `3`: Move left (if energy is ≥ 1).
  - `4`: Move right (if energy is ≥ 1).
  - `5`: Cast up (if energy is ≥ 2).
  - `6`: Cast down (if energy is ≥ 2).
  - `7`: Cast left (if energy is ≥ 2).
  - `8`: Cast right (if energy is ≥ 2).
  - `9`: Overcharge Cast (if energy is exactly 5).
