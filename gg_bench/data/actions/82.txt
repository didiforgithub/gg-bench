In the **Divider** game's gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to the starting number (N_MAX). Each index in this action space corresponds directly to a potential divisor that a player can choose to subtract from the current number N. Proper moves in the game are represented by the indices that correspond to valid proper divisors of N. Only valid indices, i.e., those corresponding to proper divisors, lead to legal moves; others are considered invalid and result in the current player's loss.
