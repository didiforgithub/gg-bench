In the `CustomEnv` class, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 actions corresponding to the digits 1 through 9. The action space index starts at 0 and maps directly to the digit by adding 1 to the index. For example, an action with index 0 maps to digit 1, index 1 maps to digit 2, and so on until index 8, which maps to digit 9. This mapping allows players to select digits based on the action indices in the game environment.
