# **Number Elimination Duel**

---

## **Objective**

Be the player who removes the last number from a shared list by strategically selecting numbers and eliminating their factors or multiples, thus leaving your opponent with no valid moves.

---

## **Setup**

- **Number List**: A shared list of consecutive integers from **1 to 15** is presented at the start of the game.
- **Players**: Two players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., coin toss, agreement).

---

## **Game Components**

- **Number List**:
  - **Numbers 1-15**: These are the numbers available for selection and elimination during the game.
- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2**: Participants who alternate turns selecting numbers.

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Progression**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with the player agreed upon.
   - On each turn, the active player selects one available number from the list.

2. **Action Order**:
   - **Selection**: Choose a number from the current list.
   - **Elimination**: Remove the selected number and all numbers that share a common factor greater than 1 with it.
   - **Update List**: Present the updated list to the next player.

3. **End of Turn**:
   - The turn ends after the elimination process.
   - The next player then takes their turn with the updated list.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, select **one** number from the available numbers in the list.

2. **Elimination Rule**:
   - After selecting a number, remove from the list:
     - The **selected number**.
     - Any other numbers that share a **common factor greater than 1** with the selected number.

3. **Common Factors**:
   - A common factor is any number (other than 1) that divides two numbers exactly.
   - For example:
     - Selecting **6** eliminates numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 15 because they share factors with 6.

4. **Prime Numbers**:
   - Selecting a **prime number** eliminates:
     - The selected prime number.
     - Any multiples of that prime number remaining in the list.

5. **Number 1**:
   - **1** can be selected on its own turn.
   - Since **1** has no factors other than itself, only **1** is removed from the list.

6. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who eliminates the **last number(s)** from the list wins.
   - If a player cannot make a move because there are no numbers left to select, they **lose**.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**: Win by removing the last number(s) from the list, leaving the opponent with no available moves.
- **No Points System**: The game is won instantly upon fulfilling the victory condition.
