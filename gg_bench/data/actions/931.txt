In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 8, which correspond to the digits 1 through 9 used in the game. Specifically, each index `i` in the action space is mapped to the move of adding the digit `i+1` to the shared sequence. For instance, an action space index of 0 represents appending the digit 1, while an index of 8 represents appending the digit 9.
