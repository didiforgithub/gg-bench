The action space indices, which range from 0 to 3, correspond to the positions of the digits in the Shared Number. An index value indicates the position of the digit in the current sequence of digits to be removed. Therefore, each index directly maps to selecting and removing a digit from the Shared Number based on its position, with 0 representing the first digit, 1 the second, 2 the third, and 3 the fourth digit (if present). If fewer digits remain (e.g., only two digits left), only indices valid for the number of digits are considered valid moves.
