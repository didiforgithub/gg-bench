In the gym environment for the game "Last Digit Standing," the action space is defined as a discrete space of 9 elements, ranging from 0 to 8. Each index in this action space corresponds to a move in the game, where the action index represents adding a number to the total. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to adding 1 to the running total, index 1 corresponds to adding 2, and so on up to index 8, which corresponds to adding 9. Therefore, to make a move, a player selects an action index, and the environment adds the integer that is one greater than that index to the current running total.
