# Intercept: A Two-Player Strategic Movement Game

## Objective

**Intercept** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a linear track. The primary goal is to be the first player to **capture** your opponent by landing on the same position on the track. Players must anticipate their opponent's moves and strategically choose their own movements to achieve a capture while avoiding being captured themselves.

## Setup

- The game is played on a **linear track** numbered from **1 to 20**.
- **Player 1** starts at **position 1**.
- **Player 2** starts at **position 20**.
- Both players are informed of the starting positions and the rules before the game begins.

## Game Components

- **Linear Track**: A series of positions numbered from **1** to **20**.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player controls a token representing their position on the track.
  - **Player 1 Token**: Represented by `P1`.
  - **Player 2 Token**: Represented by `P2`.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.
- During their turn, a player must:
  1. **Declare** the number of spaces they wish to move (**1**, **2**, or **3**).
  2. **Specify** the direction of movement:
     - **Forward** (towards the higher-numbered positions).
     - **Backward** (towards the lower-numbered positions).
- After declaring the move, the player's token is updated to the new position.
- The game continues with players alternating turns until a player captures the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Movement Range**: On each turn, a player must move their token by **exactly** **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
- **Direction**:
  - Players may move **forward** or **backward** along the track.
  - Players cannot move beyond the track boundaries (positions **1** and **20**).
- **Mandatory Movement**: Players **must** move on their turn; staying in the same position is **not allowed**.
- **Position Occupation**:
  - Both players cannot occupy the same position **simultaneously** unless a capture occurs.
  - A capture happens only when a player lands on the opponent's current position during their own turn.

### Capture Mechanics

- **Capturing the Opponent**:
  - If a player moves their token to the exact position occupied by the opponent, they **capture** the opponent and **win** the game.
- **Avoiding Capture**:
  - Players must anticipate potential capture moves by the opponent and plan their movements accordingly.

### Additional Rules

- **No Skipping Turns**: Players cannot skip their turn; they must move each time.
- **No Communication**: Players should not reveal their planned moves or strategies to the opponent during the game.
- **Fair Play**: Players must adhere to the declared movement rules without making illegal moves.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The first player to capture the opponent by landing on their position wins the game.
- **No Points System**: The game does not utilize a points system; victory is achieved solely through successful capture.
