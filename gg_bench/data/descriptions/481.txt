# Subtraction Squares - Rule Book

## Objective

**Goal:** Be the player to reduce the common pool of points to exactly zero by subtracting perfect square numbers from it. The player who reduces the total to zero **wins** the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they **lose**.

## Setup

1. **Starting Total:** The game begins with a common pool of points totaling **100**.
   - *Note:* Players can agree on a different starting total if desired, as long as it is a positive integer.

2. **Determine Player Order:**
   - Choose who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **No Physical Components Required:**
   - The game is played entirely through the command-line interface.
   - Both players should have access to input commands and view the current total after each turn.

## Game Components

- **Common Pool Total:**
  - A single integer value representing the remaining points in the game.
  - Starts at **100** and decreases as players subtract perfect squares.

- **Perfect Squares:**
  - The set of numbers obtained by squaring integers (1², 2², 3², 4², etc.).
  - Valid perfect squares for subtraction are those less than or equal to the current total.

    | n | Perfect Square (n²) |
    |---|---------------------|
    | 1 | 1                   |
    | 2 | 4                   |
    | 3 | 9                   |
    | 4 | 16                  |
    | 5 | 25                  |
    | 6 | 36                  |
    | 7 | 49                  |
    | 8 | 64                  |
    | 9 | 81                  |
    |10 | 100                 |
    |...| ...                 |

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions:**
   - On their turn, a player must:
     - Choose a valid perfect square to subtract from the current total.
     - Input the chosen perfect square into the command-line.
     - Ensure the chosen perfect square is less than or equal to the current total.

3. **Progression of Turns:**
   - After a player makes a move, the new total is announced.
   - The next player then takes their turn following the same rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Valid Moves

- **Choosing a Perfect Square:**
  - Players can only subtract perfect squares from the current total.
  - The perfect square must be **less than or equal to** the current total.
  - Examples of valid perfect squares (given specific totals):
    - If the total is **50**, valid moves include 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, and 49.
    - If the total is **10**, valid moves include 1, 4, and 9.

### 2. Subtracting and Updating Total

- **Subtracting the Perfect Square:**
  - The chosen perfect square is subtracted from the current total.
- **Announcing the New Total:**
  - After subtraction, the new total is displayed for both players.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition:**
  - A player wins if they reduce the total to **exactly zero** on their turn.
- **Losing Condition:**
  - A player loses if:
    - It's their turn, and
    - There are **no valid perfect squares** that can be subtracted from the current total.
  - This situation occurs when all possible perfect squares are greater than the current total.

### 4. No Draws

- **Guaranteed Outcome:**
  - The game cannot end in a draw.
  - Every game will result in one player winning and the other losing.

### 5. Fair Play

- **No Skipping Turns:**
  - Players cannot pass or skip their turn.
- **Invalid Moves:**
  - Choosing a number that is not a perfect square or is greater than the current total is not allowed.
  - If an invalid move is made, the player should be prompted to choose again.

## Scoring

- **Single-Game Victory:**
  - The winner is the player who reduces the total to zero.
- **Match Play:**
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of the number of games won by each player to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Total:** 100

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Valid perfect squares ≤ 100: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
   - Player 1 subtracts **36**.
   - **New Total:** 100 - 36 = **64**

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Valid perfect squares ≤ 64: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64
   - Player 2 subtracts **49**.
   - **New Total:** 64 - 49 = **15**

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Valid perfect squares ≤ 15: 1, 4, 9
   - Player 1 subtracts **9**.
   - **New Total:** 15 - 9 = **6**

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Valid perfect squares ≤ 6: 1, 4
   - Player 2 subtracts **4**.
   - **New Total:** 6 - 4 = **2**

5. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Valid perfect squares ≤ 2: 1
   - Player 1 subtracts **1**.
   - **New Total:** 2 - 1 = **1**

6. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Valid perfect squares ≤ 1: 1
   - Player 2 subtracts **1**.
   - **New Total:** 1 - 1 = **0**
   - **Player 2 Wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```plaintext
Game Start! Total points: 100

You subtracted 36.
New total is 64.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a perfect square to subtract (Valid choices: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64): 49
You subtracted 49.
New total is 15.

Player 1's turn.
Enter a perfect square to subtract (Valid choices: 1, 4, 9): 9
You subtracted 9.
New total is 6.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a perfect square to subtract (Valid choices: 1, 4): 4
You subtracted 4.
New total is 2.

Player 1's turn.
Enter a perfect square to subtract (Valid choice: 1): 1
You subtracted 1.
New total is 1.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a perfect square to subtract (Valid choice: 1): 1
You subtracted 1.
New total is 0.

Player 2 wins the game!

## Strategic Insights

- **Anticipate Future Moves:**
  - Consider the perfect squares your opponent will have available after your turn.
- **Control the Game:**
  - Aim to leave totals that are advantageous for you and force your opponent into a losing position.
- **Key Numbers:**
  - Familiarize yourself with totals that are likely to lead to a win when it's your turn (e.g., totals where no matter what perfect square the opponent subtracts, you can win on your next turn).

## Tips for Players

- **Know Your Perfect Squares:**
  - Memorize perfect squares up to the starting total for quick decision-making.
- **Calculate Ahead:**
  - Think a few moves ahead to plan your strategy.
- **Practice:**
  - Play multiple games to recognize patterns and improve your skill.

## Conclusion

Subtraction Squares is an engaging two-player game that combines simple arithmetic with strategic planning. It's easy to code and play in a command-line interface, making it accessible while still offering depth for skilled players to consistently outperform less experienced opponents.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
