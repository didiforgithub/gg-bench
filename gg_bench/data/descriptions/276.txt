# Digit Deductions

## Objective

The primary goal of **Digit Deductions** is to be the first player to correctly deduce and guess your opponent's secret two-digit number. Victory is achieved by using logical reasoning based on feedback provided by your opponent in response to your guesses. There are no draws in this game; the first player to guess correctly wins.

## Setup

1. **Secret Number Selection**:
   - Each player independently and secretly selects a two-digit number.
   - Both digits must be integers from **1 to 9** (inclusive). The digits can be the same or different.
   - Zero is **not allowed** in any position.

2. **Preparation**:
   - Players should have a means to record guesses and feedback, such as a notepad or digital text editor.
   - In a command-line interface, this can be managed within the game program itself.

3. **Starting the Game**:
   - Decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Secret Numbers**: Each player has a secret two-digit number known only to themselves.
- **Guess Records**: A log of all guesses made and the corresponding feedback received. This helps players deduce the opponent's number.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: The method by which players provide information about the accuracy of their opponent's guesses.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Players take turns in alternating order.
  - On each turn, the active player performs the following actions:
    1. **Announce a Guess**: Verbally or by inputting a two-digit number as their guess of the opponent's secret number.
    2. **Receive Feedback**: The opponent calculates and communicates the feedback based on the guess.

- **Guessing Rules**:
  - Guesses must be valid two-digit numbers with digits from 1 to 9.
  - Players should ensure their guesses are logical based on previous feedback.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Guessing and Feedback

1. **Making a Guess**:
   - The active player guesses the opponent's secret number by stating a two-digit number (e.g., 5 7).

2. **Calculating Feedback**:
   - The opponent calculates the **sum of the absolute differences** between each corresponding digit of the secret number and the guess.
   - **Formula**:
     - If the secret number is **A B** and the guess is **C D**, then the feedback is calculated as:
       - **Feedback = |A − C| + |B − D|**
     - `|A − C|` means the absolute value of the difference between digits A and C.
   - **Example**:
     - Secret Number: 6 8
     - Guess: 5 7
     - Calculation: |6 − 5| + |8 − 7| = 1 + 1 = 2
     - Feedback Provided: **2**

3. **Providing Feedback**:
   - The opponent communicates the numerical feedback to the guessing player.
   - Only the feedback number is provided—no additional hints or information.

### Winning the Game

- **Correct Guess**:
  - A player wins immediately if their guess exactly matches the opponent's secret number.
  - The game ends upon a correct guess; no further turns are taken.

- **Simultaneous Guess**:
  - If both players guess each other's secret numbers correctly on the same turn, the player who made their guess **first** in that turn wins.
  - Since turns are taken alternately, simultaneous correct guesses cannot occur.

## Scoring

- **Victory**:
  - The player who first deduces and correctly guesses the opponent's secret number wins the game.
  - No points are accumulated; it's a race to the correct answer.

- **No Draws**:
  - The game is designed to prevent draws. There will always be a winner based on who guesses correctly first.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Gameplay

**Player 1's Secret Number**: 4 7  
**Player 2's Secret Number**: 6 5

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1 Guesses**: 5 5
  - **Player 2 Calculates Feedback**:
    - |6 − 5| + |5 − 5| = 1 + 0 = **1**
  - **Feedback Provided**: 1

- **Player 2 Guesses**: 3 9
  - **Player 1 Calculates Feedback**:
    - |4 − 3| + |7 − 9| = 1 + 2 = **3**
  - **Feedback Provided**: 3

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 1 Guesses**: 6 5
  - **Player 2 Calculates Feedback**:
    - |6 − 6| + |5 − 5| = 0 + 0 = **0**
  - **Feedback Provided**: 0
  - **Player 1 Wins**: Guess exactly matches Player 2's secret number.

### Example 2: Strategic Deduction

**Player 1's Secret Number**: 8 3  
**Player 2's Secret Number**: 2 9

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1 Guesses**: 5 5
  - **Player 2's Feedback**:
    - |2 − 5| + |9 − 5| = 3 + 4 = **7**

- **Player 2 Guesses**: 7 4
  - **Player 1's Feedback**:
    - |8 − 7| + |3 − 4| = 1 + 1 = **2**

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 1 Guesses**: 2 8
  - **Player 2's Feedback**:
    - |2 − 2| + |9 − 8| = 0 + 1 = **1**

- **Player 2 Guesses**: 8 2
  - **Player 1's Feedback**:
    - |8 − 8| + |3 − 2| = 0 + 1 = **1**

**Turn 3**:

- **Player 1 Guesses**: 2 9
  - **Player 2's Feedback**:
    - |2 − 2| + |9 − 9| = 0 + 0 = **0**
  - **Player 1 Wins**: Guess exactly matches Player 2's secret number.

## Game Strategies

- **Analyze Feedback**: Use the feedback numbers to narrow down possible digits. A feedback of zero means the guess is entirely correct.
- **Digit by Digit Deduction**: Focus on one digit at a time by changing one digit in your guesses while keeping the other constant.
- **Elimination**: Keep track of which numbers have been eliminated based on previous guesses and feedback.
- **Opponent's Guesses**: Pay attention to the numbers your opponent guesses; they might reveal information about their own number.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a command-line interface, here's how a sample game might proceed:

**Player 1's Secret Number**: 3 7  
**Player 2's Secret Number**: 5 6

**Turn 1**:

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Input Guess**: `5 5`
  - **Player 2's Feedback**: `|5−5| + |6−5| = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - **Output**: `Feedback: 1`

- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - **Input Guess**: `3 5`
  - **Player 1's Feedback**: `|3−3| + |7−5| = 0 + 2 = 2`
  - **Output**: `Feedback: 2`

**Turn 2**:

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - **Input Guess**: `5 6`
  - **Player 2's Feedback**: `|5−5| + |6−6| = 0 + 0 = 0`
  - **Output**: `Feedback: 0`
  - **Player 1 Wins**

**Note**: The game ends immediately when a player receives a feedback of `0`.

## Conclusion

**Digit Deductions** is a simple yet strategically deep game that tests players' logical deduction skills. Easy to implement in a command-line interface, it offers quick gameplay with clear rules. By carefully analyzing feedback and planning guesses, a skilled player can consistently outmaneuver an unskilled opponent and achieve victory.
