In the game Equation Duel, the action space indices in the `CustomEnv` gym environment correspond directly to selecting numbers from the number pool. Each index from 0 to 8 represents selecting the numbers 1 to 9, respectively. Therefore, if a player takes an action with index `i`, they are choosing the number `i + 1` from the pool. This mapping ensures that each index directly points to a specific number in the pool.
