In the StackUp game environment, the action space consists of 15 discrete actions representing possible moves a player can make by selecting sticks. Each action corresponds to either picking a single stick or picking a pair of sticks from the available ones. The mapping of action indices to moves is as follows:

- Index 0 to 4: Picking a single stick, with index corresponding to the stick number minus one (e.g., index 0 is picking stick 1).
- Index 5 to 14: Picking pairs of sticks, with each index representing a unique combination of two sticks:
  - Index 5: Sticks 1 and 2
  - Index 6: Sticks 1 and 3
  - Index 7: Sticks 1 and 4
  - Index 8: Sticks 1 and 5
  - Index 9: Sticks 2 and 3
  - Index 10: Sticks 2 and 4
  - Index 11: Sticks 2 and 5
  - Index 12: Sticks 3 and 4
  - Index 13: Sticks 3 and 5
  - Index 14: Sticks 4 and 5 

These indices map directly to corresponding tuples in the `self.actions` list within the environment code, defining valid actions based on the combination of available sticks.
