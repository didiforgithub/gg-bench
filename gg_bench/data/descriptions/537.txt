**Game Title: Number Race**

---

### **Objective**

The objective of **Number Race** is to be the first player to reach the end of a numerical array by strategically moving through positions that match rolled numbers. Players advance by matching their die rolls with the numbers on the array positions. The first player to reach the final position of the array wins the game.

### **Setup**

1. **Array Creation**:
   - Create a linear array of 20 positions (indexed from 1 to 20).
   - Assign a random integer between 1 and 6 to each position in the array. These numbers represent the values required to land on that position.

2. **Player Tokens**:
   - Each player selects a unique token to represent their position on the array (e.g., `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2).
   - Both tokens start off the array at position 0, which is considered the starting point.

3. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Decide which player goes first (e.g., by flipping a coin or mutual agreement).

### **Game Components**

- **Array Positions**:
  - A list of 20 positions, each containing a number between 1 and 6.
  - Example of an array:
    ```
    Position: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 ...
    Number:   3  6  1  2  5  4  3  2  6   1 ...
    ```

- **Player Tokens**:
  - Symbols or identifiers used to mark each player's current position on the array.
  - Example: `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2.

- **Six-sided Die Simulation**:
  - A random number generator that produces integers from 1 to 6 to simulate die rolls during the game.

### **Turns**

- Players take turns in sequences.
- **Turn Structure for Each Player**:
  1. **Roll the Die**:
     - The player rolls the die to obtain a number between 1 and 6.
  2. **Move the Token**:
     - The player moves their token forward to the next position in the array that contains the rolled number.
     - If multiple positions ahead contain the number, the player moves only to the nearest one.
  3. **Unable to Move**:
     - If there is no position ahead with the rolled number, the player loses their turn and remains in their current position.

- **End of Turn**:
  - After moving (or not moving), the turn passes to the other player.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - Players must always move forward; backward movement is not allowed.
   - Landing on a position already occupied by the other player is permitted.

2. **Position Numbers**:
   - The numbers on positions do not change during the game.
   - Each position's number represents the required die roll to land there.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach or pass position 20 wins the game.

4. **Blocked Movement**:
   - If a player cannot move because no matching number exists ahead, they simply skip their movement for that turn.

5. **Equal Die Rolls**:
   - Die rolls and movements are independent for each player; rolling the same number as the opponent does not affect gameplay.

6. **Game Continuity**:
   - The game continues until one player reaches or passes the final position on the array.

### **Scoring**

- **Win Condition**:
  - The game is won by the first player who successfully moves their token to position 20 or beyond.
- **No Points System**:
  - There is no point accumulation; the focus is on reaching the end of the array.
