In the gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space ranging from 0 to 99. However, not all these indices correspond to valid moves in the game. A valid move in Divisor Duel is represented by choosing a proper divisor of the current number, N. Each action space index corresponds to a potential divisor â€” only those indices that match proper divisors of N can be considered valid moves in the current context. Therefore, the action a player takes is valid if it matches one of the integer divisors greater than 1 and less than N. Invalid actions, those not corresponding to a proper divisor or outside the game's context, result in penalties or ending the game.
