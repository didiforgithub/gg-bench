In the custom gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 9) are mapped to the moves in the game by adding 1 to the index. This maps index 0 to adding the number 1, index 1 to adding the number 2, and so on, up to index 9 which equates to adding the number 10. This mapping aligns with the rule that players can choose numbers from 1 to 10.
