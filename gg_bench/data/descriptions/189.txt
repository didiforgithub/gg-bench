**Divisor Duel: Rule Book**

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player to make a valid move by strategically selecting divisors of the current number. Outwit your opponent by reducing the common number intelligently to force them into a position where they cannot make a move.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer, **N**, which both players will manipulate. For a quick game, it's recommended to start with **N = 30**. Players can agree on a different starting number for longer or shorter games.

2. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first. This can be done by a mutual agreement or by any random method such as a coin toss.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Current Number (N)**: A shared positive integer that diminishes as the game progresses.
  
- **Used Divisors List**: A record of all divisors that have been chosen during the game to prevent reuse.

- **Players**: Two participants who will alternate turns.

No physical components are necessary beyond a command-line interface or simple tracking method.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Player's Move**: On their turn, a player must:

   - Choose a **proper divisor** of the current number **N** (a proper divisor is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than N that divides N without leaving a remainder).
   - **Subtract** the chosen divisor from **N** to get a new N.
   - **Record** the chosen divisor in the Used Divisors List.

2. **Alternating Turns**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

3. **No Reuse of Divisors**: Once a divisor has been used by either player, it cannot be used again for the remainder of the game.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**:

   - The chosen divisor **D** must satisfy:
     - **D > 1**
     - **D < N**
     - **N % D == 0** (D divides N without a remainder)
     - **D** has not been used previously by either player.

2. **Updating N**:

   - After a valid move, the current number **N** is updated:
     - **N = N - D**

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - The player who makes the last valid move wins.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they **lose**.

4. **Draws**:

   - **No draw is possible** in Divisor Duel. The game continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**: Winning the game by being the last to make a valid move.
- **No Point System**: There are no points; the outcome is win or loss.
- **Skill-Based**: Success depends on strategic choice of divisors and anticipation of the opponent's options.

### **Example Gameplay**

**Starting the Game**

- **N = 30**
- **Used Divisors List**: Empty

**Turns**

1. **Player 1's Turn**

   - **Possible Divisors of 30**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 (excluding 1 and 30)
   - **Chooses D = 15**
   - **Updates N**: N = 30 - 15 = **15**
   - **Updates Used Divisors List**: [15]

2. **Player 2's Turn**

   - **Possible Divisors of 15**: 3, 5 (excluding 1, 15, and 15 is used)
   - **Chooses D = 5**
   - **Updates N**: N = 15 - 5 = **10**
   - **Updates Used Divisors List**: [15, 5]

3. **Player 1's Turn**

   - **Possible Divisors of 10**: 2 (since 5 is used; 1 and 10 excluded)
   - **Chooses D = 2**
   - **Updates N**: N = 10 - 2 = **8**
   - **Updates Used Divisors List**: [15, 5, 2]

4. **Player 2's Turn**

   - **Possible Divisors of 8**: 4 (2 is used; 1 and 8 excluded)
   - **Chooses D = 4**
   - **Updates N**: N = 8 - 4 = **4**
   - **Updates Used Divisors List**: [15, 5, 2, 4]

5. **Player 1's Turn**

   - **Possible Divisors of 4**: None (2 and 4 are used; only 1 and 4 left)
   - **No Valid Move Available**
   - **Player 1 Loses**

**Outcome**: **Player 2 Wins**

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

Assuming the players are interacting through a command-line interface.

```
Game Start: N = 30

Used Divisors: 

Player 1's Turn:
- Available Divisors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- Enter your divisor: 15
- N is now: 15
- Used Divisors: 15

Player 2's Turn:
- Available Divisors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10 (excluding 15)
- Enter your divisor: 5
- N is now: 10
- Used Divisors: 15, 5

Player 1's Turn:
- Available Divisors: 2, 3, 6 (excluding 5 and 15)
- Enter your divisor: 2
- N is now: 8
- Used Divisors: 15, 5, 2

Player 2's Turn:
- Available Divisors: 3, 6, 4 (since N=8)
- Enter your divisor: 4
- N is now: 4
- Used Divisors: 15, 5, 2, 4

Player 1's Turn:
- Available Divisors: None (no proper divisors left)
- You cannot make a move.
- **Player 2 Wins!**
```

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate which divisors will be available to your opponent after your move.
- **Control the Game**: Force N into a number where the opponent has limited options.
- **Avoid Obvious Choices**: Using small divisors early might leave you without options later.

---

### **Variations**

- **Different Starting Numbers**: Start with larger numbers for a longer game.
- **Restricted Divisors**: Limit the divisors to prime numbers for added challenge.

**Divisor Duel** combines simple arithmetic with strategic foresight, making it easy to learn but challenging to master. Enjoy testing your mathematical wits against your opponent in this engaging numerical showdown!
