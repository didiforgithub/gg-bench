In the provided gym environment for the game "Target Sum Duel," the action space is defined as a discrete space from 0 to 8. Each action corresponds to selecting a number from the game's number pool, which includes the integers 1 to 9. The action index is mapped to the game number by adding 1 to the index: 

- Action `0` maps to selecting number `1`.
- Action `1` maps to selecting number `2`.
- ...
- Action `8` maps to selecting number `9`.

This mapping is used in the `step` function, where the selected action (an integer between 0 and 8) is incremented by 1 to determine the actual number added to the player's cumulative total.
