The action space in the Knight's Duel game is mapped such that each action index from 0 to 63 corresponds to a specific square on the 8x8 chessboard. The board squares are numbered row-wise starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) as index 0 to the bottom-right corner (7, 7) as index 63. Specifically, the action index can be translated into a board position (row, column) through the following mapping:

- Row: `action // 8`
- Column: `action % 8`

For example, action index 0 corresponds to the top-left square (0, 0), index 1 to (0, 1), ..., and index 63 to (7, 7) at the bottom-right. This allows each possible square on the board to be targeted directly through its respective action index.
