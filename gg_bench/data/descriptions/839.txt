**Game Name:** Number Split Duel

---

### **Objective**

Be the player to perform the last valid split by reducing composite numbers in a shared list to prime numbers. The player who makes the final move, leaving a list of only prime numbers, wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Starting Number:** The game begins with a single composite number. By default, this number is **15**, but players can agree on any composite number greater than 2.

2. **Initial List:** Create a list containing just the starting number. For example:
   ```
   Numbers List: [15]
   ```

3. **Player Order:** Decide which player goes first. This can be determined by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Numbers List:** A shared list that contains the current set of numbers in play. It starts with the single starting composite number and gets updated each turn.

- **Composite Numbers:** Numbers in the list that are not prime and greater than 1. These can be split on a player's turn.

- **Prime Numbers:** Numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Once a number becomes prime, it remains in the list unchanged.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns throughout the game.

- **Player Actions:** On their turn, a player must:

  1. **Select a Composite Number:** Choose any composite number from the Numbers List.

  2. **Split the Number:** Divide the chosen composite number into two positive integers that sum up to the original number. Both integers must be at least 1.

  3. **Update the List:** Remove the chosen composite number from the list and add the two new numbers to the end of the list.

- **Example Turn Structure:**
  ```
  Player 1's Turn:
  - Numbers List before move: [15]
  - Player 1 selects number: 15
  - Player 1 splits 15 into: 7 and 8
  - Numbers List after move: [7, 8]
  ```

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Splitting Rules:**

   - **Composite Selection:** Only composite numbers in the Numbers List can be selected for splitting. Prime numbers cannot be chosen.

   - **Splitting Constraints:** A composite number must be split into two positive integers greater than zero, and their sum must equal the original number.

   - **Valid Splits:** The two new numbers can be any combination of positive integers that meet the above criteria. They do not need to be factors of the original number.

2. **Updating the Numbers List:**

   - **Removal and Addition:** After a split, remove the original composite number from the list and append the two new numbers to the end of the list.

   - **Prime Numbers:** Once a number in the list is prime, it remains unchanged for the rest of the game.

3. **Winning the Game:**

   - **Last Valid Move:** The game continues until there are no composite numbers left in the Numbers List.

   - **Victory Condition:** The player who performs the last valid split (leaving only prime numbers in the list) wins the game.

   - **No Valid Moves:** If a player has no valid composite numbers to split on their turn, they lose the game.

4. **Additional Rules:**

   - **No Skipping Turns:** Players must make a move if a valid move is available.

   - **No Zero or Negative Numbers:** All numbers involved must be positive integers greater than zero.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Starting the Game:**

- **Starting Number:** 15
- **Numbers List:** [15]

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Numbers List before move:** [15]
- **Player 1 selects number:** 15
- **Player 1 splits 15 into:** 7 and 8
- **Numbers List after move:** [7, 8]

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Numbers List before move:** [7, 8]
- **Composite Numbers available:** 8
- **Player 2 selects number:** 8
- **Player 2 splits 8 into:** 3 and 5
- **Numbers List after move:** [7, 3, 5]

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Numbers List before move:** [7, 3, 5]
- **Composite Numbers available:** None
- **Player 1 has no valid moves and loses.**
- **Winner:** Player 2

#### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

```
Starting Number: 15
Numbers List: [15]

Player 1's Turn:
Available Composite Numbers: [15]
Select a number to split: 15
Enter two numbers that sum to 15:
First number: 7
Second number: 8
Numbers List after move: [7, 8]

Player 2's Turn:
Available Composite Numbers: [8]
Select a number to split: 8
Enter two numbers that sum to 8:
First number: 3
Second number: 5
Numbers List after move: [7, 3, 5]

Player 1's Turn:
Available Composite Numbers: []
No composite numbers left to split.
Player 1 has no valid moves.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate the possible splits and aim to force your opponent into a position with no valid moves.

- **Number Choices:** Choose splits that minimize the composite numbers left for your opponent.

- **Prime Awareness:** Be aware of prime numbers to avoid wasting moves on numbers that cannot be split.

---

### **Game Variations**

- **Different Starting Numbers:** Players can agree on a different starting composite number to adjust the game's difficulty and complexity.

- **Multiple Starting Numbers:** Begin with a list of multiple composite numbers for a longer game.

### **Conclusion**

Number Split Duel is a strategic, turn-based game that challenges players to think ahead and make optimal splits to outmaneuver their opponent. Easy to play and code in a command-line interface, it offers depth and replayability, ensuring that skilled players can consistently excel.
