- Index 0: Attack - This action consumes 2 energy units to reduce the opponent's energy by up to 3 units.
- Index 1: Defend - This action consumes 1 energy unit to mitigate the damage from the opponent's next attack by 2 units.
- Index 2: Pass - This action has no energy cost or effect, allowing the player to skip their turn.
