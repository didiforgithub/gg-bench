# Sequence Duel

## Objective

Sequence Duel is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a shared number line. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move by claiming numbers according to the game rules. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot claim any more numbers on their turn.

## Setup

- **Number Line**: The game uses a number line containing integers from **1** to **20**.
- **Starting Player**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
- **Initial State**: At the start, all numbers are unclaimed and available for selection.

## Game Components

- **Number Line (1-20)**: Represents the pool of numbers available for players to claim. Each number is either unclaimed, claimed by Player 1, or claimed by Player 2.
- **Player Tokens**: While not physical tokens, each player will have a record of the numbers they've claimed.
  - **Player 1**: Represented by `P1`.
  - **Player 2**: Represented by `P2`.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Select a Number**: On their turn, a player selects an unclaimed number from the number line that is **not adjacent** to any number claimed by the opponent.
  2. **Claim the Number**: The selected number is marked as claimed by the player.
- **Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until a player is unable to make a valid move on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection Rules

- **Valid Selection**: A player can select any unclaimed number that is **not adjacent** (i.e., does not have a difference of 1) to any number already claimed by the opponent.
  - **Adjacency**: Two numbers are adjacent if the absolute difference between them is **1**.
- **Invalid Selection**: A player **cannot** select:
  - A number already claimed by either player.
  - A number adjacent to any of the opponent's claimed numbers.

### Claiming Numbers

- Once a number is claimed by a player, it remains under their control for the rest of the game.
- Each player's claimed numbers are recorded and visible to both players.

### Winning the Game

- **Win Condition**: A player wins if their opponent has no valid numbers to select on their turn.
- **Loss Condition**: A player loses if they have no valid numbers to select when it's their turn.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Strategy**: Players can block their opponent's options by strategically claiming numbers that limit available moves.
- **No Draws**: The game is designed to always produce a winner; there are no scenarios where a draw is possible.

## Scoring

- **Single-Game Victory**: The winner is the player who successfully prevents their opponent from making a valid move.
- **Match Play**: For extended play, players can compete in multiple rounds, keeping track of victories:
  - **Win**: 1 point
  - **Loss**: 0 points
- **Overall Winner**: The player with the most points after a predetermined number of rounds wins the match.

## Strategies and Tips

- **Center Control**: Claiming central numbers like 10 can maximize your options.
- **Blocking**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves and claim numbers that limit their options.
- **Avoid Isolation**: Be cautious about selecting numbers that don't contribute to blocking your opponent.
- **Plan Ahead**: Think several moves ahead to create a path to victory.
