In the Trail Trek gym environment, the action space consists of 20 discrete actions, each corresponding to selecting a number from the shared pool of numbers 1 to 20. The mapping is direct: action index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 19) represents selecting the number `i+1` from the pool. This means action `0` selects number `1`, action `1` selects number `2`, and so on, up to action `19` which selects number `20`.
