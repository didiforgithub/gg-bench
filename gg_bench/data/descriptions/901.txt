# Divisor Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the last player to make a valid move by selecting proper divisors of numbers. Players take turns reducing the current number by choosing its proper divisors, strategically forcing the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. The player who leaves the opponent without a valid divisor to select wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number (N):** Agree upon a positive integer greater than 1 to start the game. This number will be referred to as the **Current Number** at the beginning of the game.
   - *Example Starting Number:* `60`

2. **Determine First Player:** Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done randomly or by mutual agreement.

3. **Initialize Game Components:**
   - **Current Number:** Set to the Starting Number (`N`).
   - **Used Numbers List:** An empty list to keep track of numbers that have been selected during the game.

## Game Components

- **Current Number:** The number that players will use to determine valid moves on their turn. It changes throughout the game based on player selections.
- **Proper Divisors:** Positive integers greater than 1 and less than the Current Number that divide evenly into the Current Number (without remainders). They exclude 1 and the Current Number itself.
- **Used Numbers List:** A list that records all numbers selected by both players throughout the game to avoid repeats.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Identify Valid Divisors:**
   - On your turn, examine the Current Number.
   - Determine all of its proper divisors that have not been previously used.

2. **Select a Divisor:**
   - Choose one proper divisor from the list of valid divisors.

3. **Update Game State:**
   - **Current Number:** Set the Current Number to the divisor you selected.
   - **Used Numbers List:** Add the selected divisor to this list.

4. **Announce Move:**
   - Communicate your selected divisor and the new Current Number.

5. **Pass Turn:**
   - The turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - A move is valid if:
     - The selected number is a proper divisor of the Current Number.
     - The selected number has not been previously used in the game.
     - The selected number is greater than 1 and less than the Current Number.

2. **Proper Divisors:**
   - Exclude 1 and the Current Number itself from the list of valid divisors.
   - Example: Proper divisors of 15 are 3 and 5.

3. **Used Numbers:**
   - Keep track of all numbers selected during the game.
   - A number can be selected only once per game.

4. **No Valid Moves:**
   - If a player has no valid proper divisors to select on their turn, they lose the game.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins by forcing the opponent into a position where there are no valid moves left on their turn.

6. **Fair Play:**
   - Players must select valid divisors according to the rules.
   - Misrepresenting available moves or used numbers is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **Winning Player:** The player who makes the last valid move.
- **Victory Condition:** Occurs when the opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **No Points System:** The game does not track points; victory is determined by the win condition.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Starting the Game

- **Starting Number (N):** `60`
- **Current Number:** `60`
- **Used Numbers List:** `[]`
- **Player 1:** Alice
- **Player 2:** Bob

#### Gameplay

1. **Alice's Turn**
   - **Current Number:** `60`
   - **Valid Proper Divisors of 60 (excluding used numbers):**
     `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30`
   - **Alice selects:** `30`
   - **Updates:**
     - **Current Number:** `30`
     - **Used Numbers List:** `[30]`
   - **Announces Move:** "I select 30. The new current number is 30."

2. **Bob's Turn**
   - **Current Number:** `30`
   - **Valid Proper Divisors of 30:**
     `2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15`
   - **Bob selects:** `15`
   - **Updates:**
     - **Current Number:** `15`
     - **Used Numbers List:** `[30, 15]`
   - **Announces Move:** "I select 15. The new current number is 15."

3. **Alice's Turn**
   - **Current Number:** `15`
   - **Valid Proper Divisors of 15:**
     `3, 5`
   - **Alice selects:** `5`
   - **Updates:**
     - **Current Number:** `5`
     - **Used Numbers List:** `[30, 15, 5]`
   - **Announces Move:** "I select 5. The new current number is 5."

4. **Bob's Turn**
   - **Current Number:** `5`
   - **Valid Proper Divisors of 5:**
     - None (proper divisors of 5 are only 1, which is excluded).
   - **Bob cannot make a valid move.**
   - **Bob announces:** "I have no valid moves left. Congratulations, Alice!"

#### Result

- **Winner:** Alice
- **Reason:** Bob had no valid moves on his turn.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample command-line interaction for the above gameplay between Alice and Bob.

```plaintext
Starting Number is 60.
Used Numbers: []

[Alice's Turn]
Current Number: 60
Valid Divisors: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30]
Enter your selected divisor: 30

Alice selects 30.
Current Number is now 30.
Used Numbers: [30]

[Bob's Turn]
Current Number: 30
Valid Divisors: [2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15]
Enter your selected divisor: 15

Bob selects 15.
Current Number is now 15.
Used Numbers: [30, 15]

[Alice's Turn]
Current Number: 15
Valid Divisors: [3, 5]
Enter your selected divisor: 5

Alice selects 5.
Current Number is now 5.
Used Numbers: [30, 15, 5]

[Bob's Turn]
Current Number: 5
Valid Divisors: None
Bob has no valid moves left.
Alice wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Consider the possible divisors your opponent will have on their turn based on your current move.
- **Avoid Low Numbers Early:** Reducing the Current Number to a low number too soon may give your opponent the advantage.
- **Track Used Numbers:** Keep a careful record of used numbers to avoid suggesting an invalid move.
- **Force No Moves:** Aim to leave the Current Number at a point where the opponent has no valid divisors.

## Additional Rules Variations (Optional)

To add variety and strategic depth, players may agree to implement one or more of the following optional rules before starting the game.

1. **Include 1 as a Valid Divisor:**
   - Allow 1 as a valid proper divisor.
   - This extends the game but requires additional strategic consideration.

2. **Limit Reuse of Numbers:**
   - Instead of prohibiting reuse entirely, allow each number to be used a fixed number of times (e.g., twice per game).

3. **Multiple Starting Numbers:**
   - Start with multiple numbers, and players choose which Current Number to act upon each turn.

4. **Time Limits:**
   - Impose a time limit for each player's turn to increase the challenge.

## Conclusion

Divisor Duel is a simple yet strategically rich game that tests players' number theory skills and foresight. It is easy to implement in a command-line interface, offering quick gameplay without the possibility of a draw. Mastery of Divisor Duel involves anticipating the opponent's moves and manipulating the Current Number to your advantage. Enjoy honing your mathematical strategy in this unique and engaging contest!
