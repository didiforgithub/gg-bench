In the game environment, actions are mapped as follows:

- **Movement Actions**: 
  - Actions `0, 1, 2` correspond to moving the player's token forward by `1, 2,` or `3` cells, respectively.

- **Obstacle Placement Actions**:
  - Actions `3` to `23` correspond to placing an obstacle at cell positions `0` to `20`. Specifically, action `3` places an obstacle at cell `0`, action `4` places it at cell `1`, and so on, up to action `23` which places an obstacle at cell `20`.
