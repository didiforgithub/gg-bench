The action space indices, ranging from 0 to 24, correspond to the cells in the 5x5 grid in a row-major order. Each index represents a specific cell on the grid:

- Index 0 corresponds to cell (0, 0),
- Index 1 corresponds to cell (0, 1),
- ...
- Index 4 corresponds to cell (0, 4),
- Index 5 corresponds to cell (1, 0),
- ...
- Index 24 corresponds to cell (4, 4),

This mapping allows the action space to directly translate an integer index into a grid position where a player can place their marker.
