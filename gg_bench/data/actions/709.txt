In the Divisor Duel gym environment, the action space indices are mapped to game moves by choosing divisors of the current shared number, \( N \). The action space is defined as `Discrete(N_MAX - 1)`, where each action corresponds to an index representing a divisor. Specifically, the actual move is calculated as `divisor = action + 2`. This mapping ensures that the selected divisor is a proper divisor of \( N \), starting from 2 up to \( N-1 \). The action index represents the minimum divisor (2) as index 0, and increments up to one less than the maximum starting number defined for the environment.
