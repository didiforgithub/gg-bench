# Factor Duel

## Objective

**Factor Duel** is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to **1** through strategic selection of its factors. The player who successfully reduces the number to 1 on their turn wins the game. A player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Choose a positive integer greater than 1 to begin the game. For simplicity, a default starting number of **30** is suggested, but players can agree on any suitable number.

2. **Players**: Two players are required. Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin or mutual agreement).

3. **Game Interface**: The game is played in a command-line interface where players input their chosen factors when prompted.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer value manipulated by both players throughout the game. It starts at the chosen starting number and changes as players select factors.

- **Factors**: Valid factors are integers that divide the current shared number exactly (without leaving a remainder), excluding 1 and the number itself.

- **Players**: Each player takes turns selecting factors and reducing the shared number.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn:

1. **Display the Current Shared Number**: At the start of each turn, inform the player of the current shared number.

2. **Available Factors**: List the valid factors of the current shared number (excluding 1 and the number itself).

3. **Player's Action**:

   - The player selects one of the available factors.
   - The shared number is then divided by the chosen factor.
   - The result becomes the new shared number for the next turn.

4. **Progression of Turns**: Turns alternate between the two players until the game ends (either by a player winning or losing).

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:

   - On their turn, a player must select a valid factor of the current shared number.
   - Valid factors are integers greater than 1 and less than the shared number that divide it exactly.
   - Selecting an invalid factor results in an immediate loss.

2. **Reducing the Shared Number**:

   - After selecting a valid factor, divide the shared number by this factor.
   - The quotient becomes the new shared number for the game.
   - The shared number must always remain a positive integer.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - If a player reduces the shared number to **1** on their turn, they win the game.

4. **Losing the Game**:

   - If a player cannot make a valid move because the current shared number is a prime number (and thus only divisible by 1 and itself), they lose the game.

5. **Illegal Moves**:

   - Selecting a number that is not a valid factor (does not divide the shared number exactly or is 1 or the number itself) results in an immediate loss.

## Scoring

- The game is a win-or-lose scenario with no point tracking.
- **Winner**: The player who reduces the shared number to 1 on their turn.
- **Loser**: The player who cannot make a valid move or makes an illegal move.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Starting Number**: 30

**Player 1's Turn**:

- **Current Shared Number**: 30
- **Available Factors** (excluding 1 and 30): 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 1 selects factor**: 5
- **Calculation**: 30 รท 5 = 6
- **New Shared Number**: 6

**Player 2's Turn**:

- **Current Shared Number**: 6
- **Available Factors** (excluding 1 and 6): 2, 3
- **Player 2 selects factor**: 2
- **Calculation**: 6 รท 2 = 3
- **New Shared Number**: 3

**Player 1's Turn**:

- **Current Shared Number**: 3
- **Available Factors**: None (since 3 is prime and factors exclude 1 and 3)
- **Player 1 cannot make a valid move and loses the game.**

**Result**: Player 2 wins!

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Starting Number: 30

Player 1's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 30
Available factors (excluding 1 and 30): 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter your chosen factor: 5

Player 1 selected factor 5.
New Shared Number is 6.

Player 2's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 6
Available factors (excluding 1 and 6): 2, 3
Enter your chosen factor: 2

Player 2 selected factor 2.
New Shared Number is 3.

Player 1's Turn:
Current Shared Number: 3
Available factors (excluding 1 and 3): None
No valid moves available. Player 1 loses!

Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Depth

- **Anticipate Future Moves**: Players should consider how their chosen factor will affect the next shared number and the available moves for their opponent.

- **Prime Numbers as Traps**: Forcing the shared number to a prime number greater than 1 on your opponent's turn can leave them without a valid move, securing your victory.

- **Optimal Play**: Identify factors that lead to numbers with fewer factors, limiting your opponent's options.

- **Example Strategy**:

  - With starting number 30, selecting factors that bring the shared number down to prime numbers on your opponent's turn can be a winning strategy.
  - Be cautious of the initial shared number and plan several moves ahead.

## Additional Notes

- **Custom Starting Numbers**: Players can agree to start with different numbers for varied gameplay experiences. Starting with composite numbers offers more strategic options.

- **Time Constraints**: To keep the game fast-paced, consider setting a time limit for each turn.

- **No Draws**: The game is designed to always produce a winner and a loser, ensuring a decisive outcome.

## Conclusion

**Factor Duel** is an engaging and strategic game that combines simple arithmetic with forward-thinking tactics. Easy to learn but challenging to master, it offers players an opportunity to hone their mathematical reasoning in a competitive and entertaining environment. Ideal for quick matches, it can be easily implemented in a command-line interface, making it accessible and enjoyable for players of all skill levels.
