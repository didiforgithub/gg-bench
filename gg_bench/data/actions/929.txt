The action space indices (0 to 19) in the game map directly to the available numbers in the pool. Specifically, each index corresponds to a number according to the `number_mapping` array: index 0 maps to -10, index 1 to -9, ..., up to index 9 which maps to -1, and index 10 maps to 1, ..., up to index 19 which maps to 10. When a player selects an action (index), they choose the corresponding number from this pre-defined mapping for their move.
