In the gym environment for the Divisor Duel game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with a range of integers from 0 to `max_N - 1`. This means the indices in the action space represent potential divisor values to be subtracted from the current number, `N`. However, not all indices correspond to valid moves. The indices that represent valid moves are those that match the list of proper divisors of `N`, which are all integers greater than 1 and less than `N` that divide `N` evenly. When taking a step, an action (index) translates to a divisor value, and if that divisor is not in the list of valid proper divisors or results in a non-positive `N`, it is considered an invalid move.
