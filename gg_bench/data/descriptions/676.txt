# **Factor Duel**

## **Objective**

Be the first player to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. This occurs when the current number **N** becomes a prime number or reaches **1** on your opponent's turn, leaving them without any proper divisors to choose from.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a positive integer **N**. The default starting value is **100**, but players can agree on any suitable positive integer to begin the game.
2. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be determined by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

---

## **Game Components**

- **Current Number (N)**: A shared number that changes throughout the game based on player actions.
  - **Initial Value**: Set at the beginning of the game (e.g., **100**).
  - **Range**: N is a positive integer greater than or equal to **1**.
- **Proper Divisors**: Numbers used by players to reduce **N**.
  - **Definition**: A proper divisor of **N** is a positive integer greater than **1** and less than **N** that divides **N** exactly (no remainder).

---

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with Player 1.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - **Choose a Proper Divisor**:
     - Select a proper divisor of the current number **N**.
     - The divisor must be greater than **1** and less than **N**.
     - The divisor must divide **N** exactly (no remainder).
   - **Subtract the Divisor**:
     - Subtract the chosen divisor from **N**.
     - Update **N** to this new value.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After updating **N**, it becomes the next player's turn.
   - The new **N** is used by the opponent on their turn.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the player can find at least one proper divisor of the current **N**.
2. **Forced Moves**:
   - Players must choose a proper divisor; skipping a turn or choosing an invalid number is not allowed.
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces **N** to a prime number or **1** on their turn, the opponent loses.
   - The opponent loses because they cannot find a proper divisor (since prime numbers have no proper divisors other than **1** and themselves).
4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (no proper divisors exist), they lose the game.
5. **Example of Proper Divisors**:
   - For **N = 100**, the proper divisors are: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50.

## **Scoring**

- **Win Condition**: The game is won by forcing the opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use points; it is a win/loss outcome based on gameplay.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game Play**

**Starting Number (N): 100**

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- **Current N**: 100
- **Proper Divisors of N**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
- **Action**: Choose divisor **50**.
- **Calculation**: 100 - 50 = **50**
- **New N**: 50

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- **Current N**: 50
- **Proper Divisors of N**: 2, 5, 10, 25
- **Action**: Choose divisor **25**.
- **Calculation**: 50 - 25 = **25**
- **New N**: 25

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- **Current N**: 25
- **Proper Divisors of N**: 5
- **Action**: Choose divisor **5**.
- **Calculation**: 25 - 5 = **20**
- **New N**: 20

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- **Current N**: 20
- **Proper Divisors of N**: 2, 4, 5, 10
- **Action**: Choose divisor **10**.
- **Calculation**: 20 - 10 = **10**
- **New N**: 10

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- **Current N**: 10
- **Proper Divisors of N**: 2, 5
- **Action**: Choose divisor **5**.
- **Calculation**: 10 - 5 = **5**
- **New N**: 5

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- **Current N**: 5
- **Proper Divisors of N**: None (since 5 is a prime number)
- **Outcome**: Player 2 cannot make a valid move and loses the game.

## **Command-Line Interaction Example**

Below is a sample interaction as it might appear in a command-line interface:

```
Welcome to Factor Duel!

Starting Number (N): 100

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 100
Proper Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
Enter your chosen divisor: 50
New N is now 50.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 50
Proper Divisors: 2, 5, 10, 25
Enter your chosen divisor: 25
New N is now 25.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 25
Proper Divisors: 5
Enter your chosen divisor: 5
New N is now 20.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 20
Proper Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10
Enter your chosen divisor: 10
New N is now 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 10
Proper Divisors: 2, 5
Enter your chosen divisor: 5
New N is now 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 5
Proper Divisors: None
No valid moves left! Player 2 loses.

Player 1 wins the game!
```

## **Strategies and Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the consequences of your moves on future turns.
- **Avoid Leaving Prime Numbers**: Try not to reduce **N** to a prime number on your turn unless it guarantees a win.
- **Control the Game Flow**: Manipulate **N** to numbers where the opponent has fewer proper divisors to choose from.

---

## **Conclusion**

Factor Duel is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and use their knowledge of divisors and prime numbers. It's easy to code and perfect for a quick, engaging match in a command-line interface. May the best strategist win!
