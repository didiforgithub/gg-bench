In the game environment, actions are represented by indices in the range 0 to 8, corresponding to the numbers 1 through 9 available for selection. This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index to determine the chosen number during a player's turn. Thus, each index (0-8) directly translates to selecting a number (1-9) in the game.
