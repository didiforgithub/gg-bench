In the `CustomEnv` environment, the action space consists of 625 discrete actions, each representing a combination of a placement cell and a blockade cell on the 5x5 grid. Each action is encoded as a single integer between 0 and 624 using the formula: `action = placement_cell * 25 + blockade_cell`, where `placement_cell` and `blockade_cell` each range from 0 to 24, corresponding to the linear index of the respective cells on the grid. The `placement_cell` specifies where the player's marker will be placed, and the `blockade_cell` indicates which cell will be removed. This encoding ensures that all possible pair combinations of placement and blockade actions are covered.
