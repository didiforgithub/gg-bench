# Numerical Siege

## Objective

**Primary Goal:**  
Be the first player to reduce your opponent's Base Health Points (HP) to zero by strategically attacking and defending using numbered tokens. Victory is achieved when the opponent's Base HP falls to zero or below, resulting in their Base being captured.

## Setup

1. **Base HP Initialization:**  
   - Each player starts with a Base HP of **15**.

2. **Token Deck Preparation:**  
   - Each player has a personal deck of numbered tokens ranging from **1** to **10**.
   - Tokens are represented numerically and are unique; once a token is used, it cannot be reused.

3. **Starting Conditions:**  
   - Decide who takes the first turn (coin toss, random selection, or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

1. **Base HP Tracker:**  
   - A numerical value representing the health of each player's Base.
   - Starts at **15 HP** for both players.
   - Decreases based on the outcome of attacks and defenses.

2. **Numbered Tokens Deck:**  
   - A set of numbers from **1** to **10** for each player.
   - Tokens represent both offensive and defensive capabilities.
   - Once a token is used in an attack or defense, it is removed from the game.

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure:**  
   - Players alternate turns, with each turn consisting of an **Attack Phase** and a possible **Defense Response**.

2. **Attack Phase (Attacker's Actions):**  
   - The attacker selects one token from their deck to launch an attack on the opponent's Base.
   - The chosen token is kept secret until the Defense Response.

3. **Defense Response (Defender's Actions):**  
   - Upon being attacked, the defender chooses whether to defend or not.
   - **Defend:**
     - The defender selects one token from their deck to defend against the attack.
     - Both the attacker's and defender's tokens are revealed simultaneously.
   - **Do Not Defend:**
     - The defender opts to take the attack without defending.

4. **Turn Progression:**  
   - After the attack and any defense, the used tokens are removed from the game.
   - The role of attacker and defender switches to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Attacking:**
   - The attacker selects a token (number) to attack the opponent's Base.
   - The chosen token determines the potential damage output.

2. **Defending:**
   - The defender may choose to use a token to defend.
   - The defensive token aims to mitigate or nullify the incoming attack.

3. **Outcome Determination:**
   - **If Defender Chooses to Defend:**
     - Compare the attacker's and defender's tokens.
     - **Defense Successful (Defender's token â‰¥ Attacker's token):**
       - The attack is fully deflected.
       - No damage is dealt to the defender's Base HP.
     - **Defense Partially Successful (Defender's token < Attacker's token):**
       - The attacker's damage is reduced.
       - Damage dealt = Attacker's token - Defender's token.
       - Subtract the damage from the defender's Base HP.
   - **If Defender Chooses Not to Defend:**
     - Full damage equal to the attacker's token is dealt to the defender's Base HP.

4. **Token Removal:**
   - Used tokens (both attacking and defending) are permanently removed from the player's deck.

5. **Victory Conditions:**
   - The game ends immediately when a player's Base HP reaches zero or below.
   - The player whose Base HP remains above zero is declared the winner.

## Scoring

- **Base HP Tracking:**
  - Starts at **15 HP** for each player.
  - Decreases based on attack outcomes.
  - **No point system other than Base HP.**
- **Winning the Game:**
  - Reduce the opponent's Base HP to **0 or below**.

## Examples

### Example Scenario 1:

**Initial Setup:**
- Player A and Player B both have Base HP of 15.
- Both have tokens numbered 1-10.

**Turn 1:**

- **Player A's Attack:**
  - Chooses to attack with token **6**.
- **Player B's Defense:**
  - Decides to defend with token **4**.
- **Outcome:**
  - Player B's defense (4) is less than Player A's attack (6).
  - Damage dealt = 6 - 4 = **2 HP**.
  - Player B's Base HP reduces from 15 to **13**.
- **Token Removal:**
  - Tokens **6** (Player A) and **4** (Player B) are removed from their decks.

**Turn 2:**

- **Player B's Attack:**
  - Chooses to attack with token **7**.
- **Player A's Defense:**
  - Decides to defend with token **7**.
- **Outcome:**
  - Player A's defense (7) equals Player B's attack (7).
  - Attack is fully deflected.
  - No damage dealt to Player A's Base HP.
- **Token Removal:**
  - Tokens **7** (both players) are removed from their decks.

**Turn 3:**

- **Player A's Attack:**
  - Chooses to attack with token **9**.
- **Player B's Defense:**
  - Opts **not** to defend.
- **Outcome:**
  - Full damage dealt = **9 HP**.
  - Player B's Base HP reduces from 13 to **4**.
- **Token Removal:**
  - Token **9** (Player A) is removed from their deck.

### Example Scenario 2:

**Late Game Situation:**
- Player A's Base HP: **5**
- Player B's Base HP: **3**
- Remaining Tokens:
  - Player A: [2, 3]
  - Player B: [1, 2]

**Turn 7:**

- **Player A's Attack:**
  - Chooses to attack with token **3**.
- **Player B's Defense:**
  - Only has tokens **1** and **2**.
  - Decides to defend with token **2**.
- **Outcome:**
  - Player B's defense (2) is less than Player A's attack (3).
  - Damage dealt = 3 - 2 = **1 HP**.
  - Player B's Base HP reduces from 3 to **2**.
- **Token Removal:**
  - Tokens **3** (Player A) and **2** (Player B) are removed.

**Turn 8:**

- **Player B's Attack:**
  - Uses their last token **1** to attack.
- **Player A's Defense:**
  - Decides to defend with token **2**.
- **Outcome:**
  - Player A's defense (2) is greater than Player B's attack (1).
  - Attack is fully deflected.
  - No damage dealt to Player A's Base HP.
- **Token Removal:**
  - Tokens **1** (Player B) and **2** (Player A) are removed.

**Turn 9:**

- **Player A's Attack:**
  - No tokens left (since only had tokens [2, 3]).
- **Outcome:**
  - Player A cannot attack.
  - Turn passes to Player B.

**Turn 10:**

- **Player B's Attack:**
  - No tokens left.
  - The game ends since neither player can attack.
- **Determining the Winner:**
  - Player A's Base HP: **5**
  - Player B's Base HP: **2**
  - **Player A wins** as they have higher Base HP.

**Note:** In the case where both players cannot attack, the player with the higher Base HP wins.
