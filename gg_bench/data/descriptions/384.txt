## Strategy Tips

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves**:
  - Try to predict which numbers your opponent might play based on their remaining numbers.

- **Use the Underdog Rule**:
  - Utilize the Underdog Rule by playing a number that is one less than a high-value number you expect your opponent to use.

- **Conserve High Numbers**:
  - Save your highest numbers for when you think the opponent has exhausted their high numbers.

- **Avoid Ties**:
  - Since ties result in a loss of valuable numbers without gaining points, try to choose numbers less likely to match the opponent's choice.
