In the `Sevens Challenge` gym environment, the action space consists of 19 discrete actions, which map to specific digit changes in the current two-digit number:

- **Actions 0-8**: These actions change the tens digit of the current number, where the action index corresponds to setting the tens digit to values 1 through 9. For example, action 0 sets the tens digit to 1, action 1 sets it to 2, and so on, until action 8, which sets it to 9.

- **Actions 9-18**: These actions change the ones digit of the current number, where the action index corresponds to setting the ones digit to values 0 through 9. Specifically, action 9 sets the ones digit to 0, action 10 sets it to 1, continuing up to action 18, which sets it to 9.

This mapping allows each action index to uniquely correspond to changing either the tens or ones digit to a specific value, helping the players to systematically alter the two-digit number to achieve the gameâ€™s objective.
