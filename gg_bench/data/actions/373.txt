In the action space indices for the Bit Flip Challenge gym environment, actions 0-7 correspond to a Single Flip at bit positions 1-8 (i.e., action 0 flips bit 1, action 1 flips bit 2, etc.). Actions 8-14 correspond to a Double Flip with Risk at positions 1-7, where each action flips two adjacent bits (i.e., action 8 flips bits 1 and 2, action 9 flips bits 2 and 3, etc., up to action 14, which flips bits 7 and 8).
