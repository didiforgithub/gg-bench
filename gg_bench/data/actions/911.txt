In the game environment, the action space is defined as `Discrete(20)`, which means actions are represented by indices from `0` to `19`. Each index corresponds to selecting a number from the range `1` to `20` in the game. The mapping is as follows: action index `0` selects the number `1`, action index `1` selects the number `2`, and so on, up to action index `19`, which selects the number `20`.
