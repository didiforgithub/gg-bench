In the game environment, the action space consists of 20 discrete actions. Actions 0-9 correspond to selecting numbers 1-10 without removing the opponent's top number from their stack. Actions 10-19 correspond to selecting numbers 1-10 with the choice to remove the opponent's top number if the player's total is a multiple of 10. Each action index directly maps to a specific number being selected, with actions 0-9 for numbers 1-10 with no removal, and actions 10-19 for numbers 1-10 with the option to remove if conditions allow.
