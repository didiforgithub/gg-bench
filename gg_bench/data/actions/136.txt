In the custom gym environment for the game, each action space index corresponds directly to selecting one of the 20 available numbers. Specifically, the action indexes range from 0 to 19, representing numbers 1 to 20, respectively. For example, action index 0 maps to selecting the number 1, action index 1 maps to number 2, and so on, up to action index 19 mapping to number 20. This mapping is done using `number = action + 1` in the `step` function to convert the zero-based index to the actual game number.
