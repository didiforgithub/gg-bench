# Flag Chase

## Objective

**Flag Chase** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played on a simple linear grid in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to capture your opponent's flag by moving your piece to their base position at the opposite end of the grid. A skilled player can leverage strategic movement and mind games to outplay their opponent and secure victory.

## Setup

- **Grid Layout**: A linear grid consisting of 5 cells in a single row, numbered from 1 to 5.
  ```
  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
  ```
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1 (P1)** starts at **Cell 1**.
  - **Player 2 (P2)** starts at **Cell 5**.
- **Flags**: Each player's flag is located at their respective starting cell (P1's flag at Cell 1, P2's flag at Cell 5).
- **Initial Conditions**: Both players' pieces are positioned on their starting cells, guarding their flags.

## Game Components

- **Grid Cells**: Represented numerically from 1 to 5.
  - **Cell Appearance**: Empty cells are displayed as `[ ]`.
  - **Player Pieces**:
    - **P1** is represented by `P1`.
    - **P2** is represented by `P2`.
  - **Flags**: Implicitly located at each player's starting cell.
- **Player Pieces**: Each player controls a single piece used to navigate the grid and engage the opponent.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Movement Phase**:
     - The active player chooses to move their piece **forward** or **backward** by **one cell**.
     - Movement is restricted to within the grid (Cells 1 to 5).
  2. **Conflict Check**:
     - If both players occupy the same cell after movement, a **Battle** occurs.
     - If no battle occurs, the turn passes to the next player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Forward Movement**:
  - P1 moves from lower-numbered cells to higher-numbered cells (e.g., from Cell 2 to Cell 3).
  - P2 moves from higher-numbered cells to lower-numbered cells (e.g., from Cell 4 to Cell 3).
- **Backward Movement**:
  - Players can move back towards their own base to strategize or avoid conflict.
- **Boundary Limitation**:
  - Players cannot move beyond the grid boundaries (Cell 1 and Cell 5).
  - Attempting to move beyond the grid results in staying in the current position.

### Battle Mechanics

- A **Battle** occurs when both players' pieces occupy the same cell.
- **Battle Resolution**:
  1. **Secret Choice**:
     - Each player privately selects a number between **1 and 5**.
  2. **Reveal**:
     - The chosen numbers are revealed simultaneously.
  3. **Outcome**:
     - **Higher Number Wins**:
       - The player who chose the higher number wins the battle.
       - The losing player's piece is sent back to their own base (Cell 1 for P1, Cell 5 for P2).
     - **Tie**:
       - In case of a tie, both players' pieces are sent back to their respective bases.
- **Post-Battle**:
  - The winning player remains on the contested cell.
  - The next turn begins with the player following the one who initiated the last move.

### Winning the Game

- **Capturing the Flag**:
  - A player captures the opponent's flag by moving their piece onto the opponent's base cell while the opponent's piece is not present there.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to successfully capture the opponent's flag wins the game.
- **Defensive Stand**:
  - If a player reaches the opponent's base cell and the opponent's piece is there, a battle occurs as per the battle mechanics.

## Scoring

- There is no point tracking in **Flag Chase**.
- The outcome is binary: one player wins by capturing the opponent's flag.
