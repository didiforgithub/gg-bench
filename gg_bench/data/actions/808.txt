The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` gym environment correspond to specific moves on the number line as follows:

- **Index 0**: `L1` - Move Left by 1 position.
- **Index 1**: `L2` - Move Left by 2 positions.
- **Index 2**: `R1` - Move Right by 1 position.
- **Index 3**: `R2` - Move Right by 2 positions.

These indices define the discrete actions available to the players, allowing them to choose both the direction and the number of steps to move during their turn.
