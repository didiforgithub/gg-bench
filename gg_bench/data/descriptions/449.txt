# Trap Runner Rule Book

## Objective

**Trap Runner** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a 5x5 grid. The primary goal is to **capture your opponent's token** by moving onto their position **after reducing their shields to zero**. Players must balance offensive strategies to deplete their opponent's shields with tactical movements to position themselves for capture.

## Setup

- **Game Grid**: A 5x5 grid labeled with coordinates `(X, Y)` where `X` and `Y` range from `1` to `5`.
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1**: Starts at position `(1, 1)`.
  - **Player 2**: Starts at position `(5, 5)`.
- **Shields**:
  - Each player begins with **3 shields**.
  
Both players' tokens and shields are displayed on the grid or through command-line outputs at the start of the game.

## Game Components

- **Grid**:
  - Represents the game board as a 5x5 matrix.
  - Coordinates range from `(1,1)` in the bottom-left corner to `(5,5)` in the top-right corner.
- **Player Tokens**:
  - **Player 1 Token**: Represented as `P1`.
  - **Player 2 Token**: Represented as `P2`.
- **Shields**:
  - Each player has shields represented numerically (e.g., `Shields: 3`).
  - Shields protect players from being captured.

## Turns

Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**. On each turn, a player must choose to perform **one** of the following actions:

1. **Move**:
   - Move your token to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).
   - Diagonal movements are **not** allowed.
2. **Attack**:
   - Reduce your opponent's shields by **one**.

After a player completes their action, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement

- **Adjacent Cells**: Movement can only be to cells directly above, below, or beside the current position.
- **Grid Wrapping**:
  - Moving off the grid on one side wraps around to the opposite side.
  - Example: Moving left from `X = 1` wraps to `X = 5`; moving up from `Y = 5` wraps to `Y = 1`.
- **Occupied Cells**:
  - You **cannot** move onto a cell occupied by your opponent **unless** they have zero shields.

### Attacking

- **Reducing Shields**:
  - When you choose to attack, your opponentâ€™s shields decrease by one.
  - You cannot attack if your opponent has zero shields.
- **No Movement**:
  - Choosing to attack means you forego movement for that turn.

### Shields

- **Protection**:
  - Shields prevent your opponent from capturing you.
- **Depletion**:
  - When shields reach zero, your token becomes vulnerable to capture.

### Capturing

- **Conditions for Capture**:
  - Your opponent has zero shields.
  - You move your token onto the opponent's current position.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - Successfully capturing your opponent results in an immediate win.

## Scoring

There is no point-based scoring system. Victory is achieved by capturing your opponent according to the rules above.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

**Initial State**:
```
Player 1 Position: (1,1), Shields: 3
Player 2 Position: (5,5), Shields: 3
```

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Move right to `(2,1)`
- **Command**: `move right`

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:
- **Action**: Attack (Player 1's shields decrease to 2)
- **Command**: `attack`

**Turn 3 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Move up to `(2,2)`
- **Command**: `move up`

**Turn 4 - Player 2**:
- **Action**: Move left to `(4,5)`
- **Command**: `move left`

**Turn 5 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Attack (Player 2's shields decrease to 2)
- **Command**: `attack`

**Turn 6 - Player 2**:
- **Action**: Attack (Player 1's shields decrease to 1)
- **Command**: `attack`

**Turn 7 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Move up to `(2,3)`
- **Command**: `move up`

**Turn 8 - Player 2**:
- **Action**: Move up to `(4,1)` (since moving up from `Y=5` wraps to `Y=1`)
- **Command**: `move up`

**Continued Play**:
Players continue to strategically move and attack. If Player 1 reduces Player 2's shields to zero and moves onto Player 2's position at `(4,1)`, Player 1 wins.

## Command-Line Interactions

- **Movement Commands**:
  - `move up`
  - `move down`
  - `move left`
  - `move right`
- **Attack Command**:
  - `attack`
- **Game Feedback**:
  - After each turn, the game displays:
    - Both players' positions.
    - Remaining shields.
    - An updated grid (optional).

**Example**:
```
Player 1, it's your turn.
Enter command: move right
You moved to position (2,1).

Player 2, it's your turn.
Enter command: attack
You attacked Player 1. Player 1's shields are now 2.
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Balance Attack and Movement**:
  - Constantly attacking may leave you out of position.
  - Prioritize movement if you see an opportunity to capture.
- **Monitor Shields**:
  - Keep track of both your own and your opponent's shields.
  - Timing your attacks to deplete shields at the right moment is crucial.
- **Use Grid Wrapping**:
  - Leverage the grid wrapping to surprise your opponent or to escape.
- **Predict Opponent's Moves**:
  - Anticipate where your opponent might move to plan your attacks or set up a capture.

By mastering these strategies, skilled players can consistently outmaneuver less experienced opponents.
