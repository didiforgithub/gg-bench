The action space in the gym environment is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, which means there are 10 possible actions, indexed from 0 to 9. Each index corresponds to a number from 1 to 10 that a player can choose during their turn. Specifically, the action `n` in the range of 0 to 9 is mapped to the move `N = n + 1`, where `N` is the integer selected for the number pool in the game.
