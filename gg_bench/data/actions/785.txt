In the gym environment for the Number Tower game, the action space indices map directly to the numbers in the game. The action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 possible actions, corresponding to the numbers from 1 to 9. Specifically, the index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, until index 8, which maps to the number 9. This means that when a player selects an action with a specific index, they are choosing to place the number associated with that index from the number pool onto the tower.
