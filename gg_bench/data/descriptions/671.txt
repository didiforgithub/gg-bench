**Divisor Duel**  
*Rule Book*

---

### **Objective**

**Divisor Duel** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played via a command-line interface. Players take turns dividing a shared number by its proper divisors in an attempt to be the first to reduce the number to exactly **1**. The player who reduces the current number to **1** on their turn wins the game. There are no draws, and skilled players can leverage mathematical strategies to consistently outperform less experienced opponents.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Starting Number**: Agree on a positive integer greater than **1** to be the **Starting Number**. The default starting number is **60**, but players can choose any suitable number for variation.

2. **Determine First Player**: Decide which player goes first by mutual agreement, coin toss, or random selection.

3. **Initialize Game State**: Set the **Current Number** to the **Starting Number**.

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Current Number**: The shared number that players manipulate during the game. It starts as the **Starting Number** and changes as players divide it.

2. **Proper Divisors**: For any given **Current Number**, these are all positive integers greater than **1** and less than the **Current Number** that divide it evenly (without leaving a remainder).

3. **Command-Line Interface**: The game operates via text-based inputs and outputs. Players input their chosen divisors, and the game displays the updated **Current Number** and other relevant information.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player designated during setup.

2. **Actions During a Turn**:

   - **List Divisors**: The game lists all proper divisors of the **Current Number**.
   - **Choose Divisor**: The active player selects one proper divisor from the list.
   - **Divide**: The **Current Number** is divided by the chosen divisor to obtain a new **Current Number**.
   - **Announce Move**: The player announces their chosen divisor and the new **Current Number**.

3. **End of Turn**: The turn ends after the player announces their move. The new **Current Number** is now used for the next player's turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Divisors**: Players must choose a divisor that is a proper divisor of the **Current Number** (greater than **1** and less than the **Current Number**) and that divides evenly into it.

2. **Division Result**: The division must result in a whole number without any remainder.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - A player wins if they reduce the **Current Number** to exactly **1** on their turn.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., there are no proper divisors greater than **1**), they lose the game.

4. **Invalid Moves**:

   - If a player selects an invalid divisor (not a proper divisor or does not divide evenly), they immediately forfeit the game.
   - Players are encouraged to double-check their choices before confirming.

5. **Prime Number Scenario**:

   - If the **Current Number** is a prime number greater than **2**, the player cannot make a move (as there are no proper divisors greater than **1**), resulting in a loss.

6. **No Skipping Turns**: Players cannot skip their turn. They must select a valid divisor or lose the game if none are available.

### **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game**: The objective is to win by reducing the **Current Number** to exactly **1** on your turn.
- **No Point System**: There are no points or scores tracked during the game. The focus is on strategic play leading to a win.
- **Match Play**: Players may agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Standard Gameplay**

**Starting Number**: 60

**Player 1's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 60: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- Player 1 chooses **15**.
- Calculation: 60 รท 15 = **4**
- Player 1 announces: "I divide by 15. The new number is 4."

**Player 2's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 4: 2
- Player 2 chooses **2**.
- Calculation: 4 รท 2 = **2**
- Player 2 announces: "I divide by 2. The new number is 2."

**Player 1's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 2: None (since 2 is prime and proper divisors exclude 1 and the number itself).
- Player 1 cannot make a move and **loses the game**.
- **Player 2 wins!**

#### **Example 2: Strategic Play**

**Starting Number**: 100

**Player 1's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 100: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
- Player 1 chooses **25**.
- Calculation: 100 รท 25 = **4**
- Player 1 announces: "I divide by 25. The new number is 4."

**Player 2's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 4: 2
- Player 2 chooses **2**.
- Calculation: 4 รท 2 = **2**
- Player 2 announces: "I divide by 2. The new number is 2."

**Player 1's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 2: None
- Player 1 cannot make a move and **loses the game**.
- **Player 2 wins!**

#### **Example 3: Invalid Move**

**Starting Number**: 30

**Player 1's Turn**:

- Proper Divisors of 30: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- Player 1 chooses **7** (invalid, as 7 is not a divisor of 30).
- This is an **invalid move**.
- **Player 1 forfeits the game**.
- **Player 2 wins by default!**

### **Sample Command-Line Interaction**

```
Game Start! The starting number is 60.

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 60 are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
Enter your divisor: 12
You chose divisor 12.
60 / 12 = 5
The new number is 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 5 are: None
Player 2 cannot make a move.
Player 2 loses the game!
Player 1 wins!
```

### **Strategies**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of your moves to avoid setting up your opponent for a win.
- **Force Prime Numbers**: Try to reduce the **Current Number** to a prime number on your opponent's turn, leaving them without valid moves.
- **Avoid Even Numbers Early**: Dividing to an even number may give your opponent more options.
- **Memorize Divisor Chains**: Familiarize yourself with divisor relationships of common numbers to make quicker, smarter decisions.

**Note**: While the game mechanics are simple, mastering **Divisor Duel** requires strategic thinking and a good understanding of number properties. Practice and experience will enhance your ability to predict outcomes and control the flow of the game.
