In the gym environment for Subtraction Square, the action space consists of discrete indices representing the available square numbers that can be subtracted from the shared total. Each index maps to a specific square number as follows:

- Index 0 maps to the square number 1 (1×1).
- Index 1 maps to the square number 4 (2×2).
- Index 2 maps to the square number 9 (3×3).
- Index 3 maps to the square number 16 (4×4).

Players choose an index from the action space to enact a move, which subtracts the corresponding square number from the shared total.
