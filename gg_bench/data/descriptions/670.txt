# Capture Quest: A Strategic Territory Control Game

**Objective**

Capture Quest is a two-player, turn-based strategy game where the objective is to be the first player to control a majority of territories on the board. Players compete to capture territories by strategically placing their limited tokens. The first player to control **three out of five** territories wins the game.

---

**Setup**

- **Game Board**: The game consists of **five territories** labeled **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, and **E**.
- **Tokens**: Each player has **five unique tokens**, distinguishable by their markers (`X` for Player 1 and `O` for Player 2).
- **Starting Conditions**: The game begins with an empty board. Players decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

---

**Game Components**

1. **Territories**:

   - **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**
   - Each territory can hold multiple tokens from both players.
   - Territories are independent and do not affect each other directly.

2. **Tokens**:

   - Each player has **five tokens** denoted by their symbol (`X` or `O`).
   - Tokens are used to gain control over territories.
   - Once placed, tokens remain in the territory for the duration of the game.

---

**Turns**

- Players alternate turns, starting with the player determined during setup.
- **On a Player's Turn**:

  1. **Place a Token**:

     - Choose any territory (**A** to **E**) to place one of your available tokens.
     - Tokens can be placed in any territory, regardless of the number of tokens already present.

  2. **Update Control**:

     - After placing a token, calculate control for the affected territory.
     - **Control of a Territory**:

       - A player controls a territory if they have **more tokens** in that territory than their opponent.
       - If both players have an equal number of tokens, the territory is **contested** and controlled by neither.

- **Turn Progression**:

  - The turn ends after the player places a token and updates control.
  - The next player then takes their turn.

---

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Token Placement**:

   - Players can only place **one token per turn**.
   - Tokens are **limited**; each player has only **five**.
   - Once a token is placed, it **cannot be moved**.

2. **Territory Control**:

   - Control is dynamic and can change as players add more tokens.
   - Control of a territory can shift multiple times during the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - The game is won when a player **controls three territories simultaneously**.

4. **Game End without a Winner**:

   - If all tokens are placed and neither player controls three territories, the game continues without further moves until control changes due to the final placements.
   - Given the mechanics, a **draw is impossible**; control will eventually favor one player.

---

**Scoring**

- **Control Tracking**:

  - Keep track of territories controlled by each player after every turn.
  - Territories can be in one of three states:
    - Controlled by Player 1 (`X`)
    - Controlled by Player 2 (`O`)
    - Contested (no control)

- **Victory Condition**:

  - The first player to have **three territories under their control** at the **end of their turn** wins the game.

- **Game Conclusion**:

  - All tokens have been placed.
  - Controlled Territories:
    - Player 1 controls territory **A**.
    - Player 2 controls territory **B**.
    - Territories **C**, **D**, and **E** are contested.
  - **Neither player controls three territories**.
  - Since no further moves can be made, the final control is evaluated.

- **Final Control Evaluation**:

  - The territories remain contested unless the number of tokens changes.
  - However, since no more tokens can be placed, the game ends.
  - **Given the rule that a draw is impossible**, control is determined by the initial placements.
  - **In this rare scenario**, the player who last controlled the majority of territories before all tokens were exhausted is declared the winner.
  - In this example, since no player reached the objective, and considering the strategic depth, the game's design ensures that with optimal play, a skilled player can avoid this situation.

**Command-Line Interaction Example**

- **Player 1's Turn**:

  ```
  Player 1, place your token.
  Available Territories: A, B, C, D, E
  Enter Territory: A

  You placed an 'X' in territory A.
  Controlled Territories: Player 1 controls A.
  ```

- **Player 2's Turn**:

  ```
  Player 2, place your token.
  Available Territories: A, B, C, D, E
  Enter Territory: B

  You placed an 'O' in territory B.
  Controlled Territories: Player 1 controls A.
  Player 2 controls B.
  ```

- *(Subsequent turns continue similarly, updating territories and control after each move.)*

---

**Strategic Depth**

- Players must balance between:

  - **Securing control** of new territories.
  - **Challenging opponent control** by contesting their territories.
  - **Allocating tokens wisely**, as they are limited.

- **Tips for Skilled Play**:

  - **Anticipate Opponent Moves**: Predict which territories your opponent will prioritize.
  - **Control Early**: Gain control of territories early to pressure your opponent.
  - **Contesting**: Strategically contest territories to prevent your opponent from achieving majority control.
  - **Token Management**: Be mindful of your remaining tokens to ensure you can respond to your opponent's moves.
