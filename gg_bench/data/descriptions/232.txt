**Game Name:** Laser Bounce

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to hit your opponent's base with a laser beam by strategically placing and orienting mirrors on a shared grid. Victory is achieved when your laser beam reaches the opponent's base during your turn.

---

**Setup:**

- **Grid:** The game is played on a 5x5 grid.
- **Bases:**
  - **Player 1's base** is located at position **(1,3)** (left center of the grid).
  - **Player 2's base** is located at position **(5,3)** (right center of the grid).
- **Mirrors:** Each player starts with **three mirrors**.
- **Initial State:** The grid is empty except for the bases.

---

**Game Components:**

1. **Grid:**
   - A 5x5 grid represented by coordinates `(x,y)`, where `x` and `y` range from 1 to 5.
   - Positions are addressed as `(column, row)`.

2. **Bases:**
   - Fixed positions where lasers originate.
   - Represented by `B1` for Player 1 and `B2` for Player 2.

3. **Mirrors:**
   - Each player has three mirrors.
   - Mirrors can be placed on empty squares.
   - **Orientations:**
     - **Forward Slash (`/`):** Reflects lasers coming from left or right upward or downward, respectively.
     - **Backslash (`\`):** Reflects lasers coming from left or right downward or upward, respectively.

4. **Laser Beams:**
   - Fired from a player's base horizontally towards the opponent's side.
   - Changes direction when interacting with mirrors.

---

**Turns:**

Players alternate turns, with each turn consisting of:

1. **Action Phase:**
   - **Option 1:** Place one mirror on an empty square with a chosen orientation (`/` or `\`).
   - **Option 2:** Rotate one of your existing mirrors on the grid to the opposite orientation.
   
2. **Laser Firing Phase:**
   - Fire a laser from your base in the horizontal direction towards the opponent's side.
   - The laser travels and interacts with mirrors according to the rules.
   
3. **End of Turn:**
   - If the laser hits the opponent's base, you win.
   - If not, the turn passes to the opponent.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Mirror Placement and Rotation:**
   - Mirrors cannot be placed on the bases or occupied squares.
   - You cannot have more than three mirrors on the grid at any time.
   - You can only rotate your own mirrors.
   
2. **Laser Movement and Interaction:**
   - **Movement:**
     - The laser moves one square at a time in its current direction.
     - Possible directions: left, right, up, down.
   - **Interaction with Mirrors:**
     - **Forward Slash (`/`) Mirror:**
       - If the laser hits from the left, it is deflected upward.
       - If the laser hits from the right, it is deflected downward.
     - **Backslash (`\`) Mirror:**
       - If the laser hits from the left, it is deflected downward.
       - If the laser hits from the right, it is deflected upward.
   - **Laser Path Termination:**
     - The laser continues until it exits the grid or hits a base.
     - The laser cannot pass through bases or mirrors.
   
3. **Winning the Game:**
   - Hit the opponent's base with your laser during your turn.
   - There is no draw mechanism; play continues until one player wins.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Victory Condition:** The first player to successfully direct their laser to hit the opponent's base wins the game.
- There are no points; the game is won outright when the objective is achieved.
