# Zero-Sum Grid

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce **all numbers on the grid to zero** on your turn. The player who makes the move that results in all numbers in the grid being zeros wins the game.

---

## Setup

- **Grid Size:** The game is played on a **3x3 grid**.
- **Initial Numbers:** Each cell in the grid is initialized with a **random integer between -5 and 5**, excluding zero (i.e., values range from -5 to -1 and 1 to 5).
- **Player Order:** Players decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin or mutual agreement).

---

## Game Components

### Grid

- A 3x3 grid displayed on the command-line interface.
- Each cell contains an integer value.
  
Example Initial Grid:

```
Row\Col |  1   2   3
-----------------------
   1    |  2  -3   4
   2    | -1   5  -2
   3    |  3  -4   1
```

### Players

- **Player 1** and **Player 2** take turns.
- Each player will perform actions to modify the grid.

---

## Turns

On each turn, a player must:

1. **Select a Line:**
   - Choose either a **row** or a **column** to modify.
   - Rows are numbered **1** to **3** from top to bottom.
   - Columns are numbered **1** to **3** from left to right.

2. **Choose an Operation:**
   - Decide to either **add 1** or **subtract 1** to all numbers in the selected line.

3. **Execute Move:**
   - The chosen operation is applied to all numbers in the selected row or column simultaneously.
   - The grid updates to reflect the changes.

4. **Check for Win:**
   - After the move, if **all numbers in the grid are zero**, the player wins the game.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Line Selection:**
   - Players can choose any row or column on their turn.
   - There is no restriction on selecting the same line multiple times during the game.

2. **Operations:**
   - **Add 1 (+1):** Increases all numbers in the selected line by 1.
   - **Subtract 1 (-1):** Decreases all numbers in the selected line by 1.

3. **Grid Updates:**
   - Numbers can become positive, negative, or zero.
   - The grid is updated immediately after each turn.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The first player to make all numbers in the grid zero on their turn wins.
   - The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite number of possible states.

5. **Invalid Moves:**
   - All moves are valid as long as they follow the turn structure.
   - There are no prohibited actions or illegal moves.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition:** The game is won by reducing all numbers in the grid to zero on your turn.
- **No Points System:** There is no point accumulation; the focus is on achieving the objective to win.
