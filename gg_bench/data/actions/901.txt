The action space indices in the gym environment directly map to the potential moves in the game by representing each possible divisor selection as an index from 0 to `MAX_NUMBER` (i.e., 0 to 100). An action chosen by a player corresponds to selecting a divisor represented by that index. An index is only a valid move if it represents a number that is a proper divisor of the `Current Number`, hasn't been previously used, and falls within the valid range (greater than 1 and less than the `Current Number`).
