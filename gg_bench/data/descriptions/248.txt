# Factor Race

## Objective

Be the first player to reach **exactly** the target number by strategically multiplying a shared cumulative product using numbers from 2 to 9 inclusive. The player who causes the cumulative product to reach the target number wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Choose a Target Number:**
   - Decide on a target number for the game. It's recommended to use a moderate-sized composite number with multiple factors for strategic depth (e.g., 72).

2. **Initialize the Cumulative Product:**
   - Start with a shared cumulative product of **1**.

3. **Determine Player Order:**
   - Decide which player goes first using any agreed-upon method (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Target Number:** The number that players aim to reach exactly. Example: **72**.
- **Shared Cumulative Product:** A number starting at **1** that gets updated each turn based on players' multipliers.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- On each turn, a player performs the following actions:
  1. **Choose a Multiplier:**
     - Select an integer between **2** and **9** inclusive.
  2. **Update the Cumulative Product:**
     - Multiply the shared cumulative product by the chosen multiplier.
     - Announce the chosen multiplier and the new cumulative product.
  3. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions:**
     - If the new cumulative product **equals** the target number, the player **wins**.
     - If the new cumulative product **exceeds** the target number, the player **loses** immediately.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Multipliers:**
   - On your turn, you must choose a multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.

2. **Updating the Cumulative Product:**
   - Multiply the current cumulative product by your chosen multiplier.
   - The result becomes the new cumulative product.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - You win if your move brings the cumulative product to **exactly** the target number.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - You lose if your move causes the cumulative product to **exceed** the target number.

5. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw. It continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.

## Scoring

- The game is won by the player who successfully reaches the target number exactly.
- There is no point scoring; the outcome is simply a win or a loss.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Target Number:** 72  
**Starting Cumulative Product:** 1

#### Turn Sequence:

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses multiplier **3**.
   - Calculation: 1 × 3 = **3**.
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 3. The new product is 3."

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses multiplier **4**.
   - Calculation: 3 × 4 = **12**.
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 4. The new product is 12."

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Chooses multiplier **3**.
   - Calculation: 12 × 3 = **36**.
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 3. The new product is 36."

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Chooses multiplier **2**.
   - Calculation: 36 × 2 = **72**.
   - Announces: "Multiplied by 2. The new product is 72."
   - **Player 2 wins the game!**

### Example of Losing by Exceeding the Target Number

**Target Number:** 72  
**Current Cumulative Product:** 48

**Player's Turn:**

- Available multipliers: 2 to 9.
- Any multiplier chosen will result in exceeding 72:
  - 48 × 2 = 96 (exceeds 72)
  - 48 × 3 = 144 (exceeds 72)
  - ... and so on.
- **Player loses the game** for exceeding the target number.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Welcome to Factor Race!
Target Number: 72
Starting Cumulative Product: 1

Player 1's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 3
Multiplied by 3. The new product is 3.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 4
Multiplied by 4. The new product is 12.

Player 1's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 3
Multiplied by 3. The new product is 36.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 2
Multiplied by 2. The new product is 72.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Factor Awareness:**
  - Familiarize yourself with the factors of the target number to plan effective moves.

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the results of possible multipliers to avoid exceeding the target number.

- **Force Your Opponent:**
  - Aim to put your opponent in a position where any move they make will cause them to exceed the target number.

- **Avoid Trap Numbers:**
  - Be cautious when the cumulative product is a factor that could leave you with no safe multipliers on your next turn.

## Ensuring Fair Play

- **Valid Input:**
  - Always enter a valid multiplier between 2 and 9.
  - Invalid inputs should prompt a re-entry.

- **Honesty in Announcements:**
  - Correctly announce the multiplier chosen and the resulting cumulative product.

- **Dispute Resolution:**
  - If there is a disagreement, recalculate the cumulative product to ensure accuracy.
