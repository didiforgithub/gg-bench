## Objective

**Trap Builder** is a two-player strategic game played on a linear path. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach the opponent's starting position without stepping on a hidden trap. Players must use deduction and strategy to avoid traps and outmaneuver their opponent. A player loses the game if they step on a trap or if the opponent reaches their starting position safely.

3. **Traps**:

Player 2, place your traps by entering three positions (1-9), separated by spaces:
> 2 6 8

Let the game begin!
```

#### Gameplay

```
Player 1 is at Position 0.
Player 1, enter your move (1-3 steps):
> 2

Player 1 moves to Position 2.

Player 2 is at Position 10.
Player 2, enter your move (1-3 steps):
> 1

Player 2 moves to Position 9.

Player 1 is at Position 2.
Player 1, enter your move (1-3 steps):
> 1

Player 1 moves to Position 3.

Player 2 is at Position 9.

Oh no! Player 2 stepped on a trap at Position 6!

Player 1 wins the game!
```

### Strategic Considerations

- **Deduction**:
  - Use the opponent's movements to infer possible trap locations.
- **Safe Positions**:
  - Positions immediately after the opponent may be safer if they have just moved through them.
- **Risk Management**:
  - Decide when to take larger moves versus smaller, safer steps.
