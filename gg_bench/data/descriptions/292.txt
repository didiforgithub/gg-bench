# Prime Panic: Rule Book

## Objective

**Prime Panic** is a strategic numerical game for two players. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly 50 points**. Players accumulate points by adding numbers to their total score. Special rules apply when the total score reaches a prime number, adding strategic depth to the game. Victory is achieved by skillfully selecting numbers to reach the target score while leveraging the prime number rule.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players are required.
- **Starting Score**: Both players start with a score of **0 points**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first (e.g., flip a coin). Play then alternates between the two players.

## Game Components

- **Score Tracker**: Each player needs a method to track their score. This can be a simple variable in the command-line interface or noted on paper.
- **Number Selection**: Players will choose numbers between **1 and 10** inclusive during their turns.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Number Selection**: On their turn, a player selects a whole number between **1 and 10** inclusive.
  2. **Score Update**: The selected number is added to the player's total score.
  3. **Prime Check**:
     - If the new total score is a **prime number**, the player's total score is **doubled** immediately.
  4. **Win Condition Check**: If the player's total score is **exactly 50**, they win the game.
  5. **Overage Check**: If the player's total score exceeds **50**, their score is reset to **0**.
- **Turn Progression**: After completing the above steps, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players must choose a whole number between **1 and 10** inclusive on each turn.
   - The chosen number is added to their own total score.

2. **Prime Number Rule**:
   - After adding the chosen number, if the player's new total score is a **prime number**, their total score is immediately **doubled**.
   - The doubling occurs only once per turn, regardless of whether the doubled score is also a prime number.

3. **Scoring Limits**:
   - If a player's total score exceeds **50** after any actions (addition and potential doubling), their score is reset to **0**.
   - Players must reach **exactly 50 points** to win; exceeding 50 results in a reset.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach a total score of **exactly 50 points** wins the game.

5. **No Draws**:
   - There is no draw mechanism in the game. Play continues until one player reaches exactly 50 points.

6. **Strategy**:
   - Players must strategically choose numbers to optimize their score progression while considering the prime number rule.
   - Anticipating future moves and the potential for score doubling adds depth to the gameplay.

## Scoring

- **Tracking Score**: Keep a running total of each player's score throughout the game.
- **Doubling for Primes**:
  - Example: If a player's score is **17** after addition, since **17** is prime, the score is doubled to **34**.
- **Exceeding 50**:
  - If a player's score exceeds **50** at any point, their score resets to **0**.
  - Example: A player with **45** chooses **7**, totaling **52**. Since **52 > 50**, their score resets to **0**.
