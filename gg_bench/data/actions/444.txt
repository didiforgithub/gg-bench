In the provided game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(N_max + 1)`, meaning it includes integers from `0` to `N_max`. However, valid moves (actions) are limited to proper divisors of the current number `N`. The proper divisors are positive integers less than `N` that divide `N` evenly and can be directly mapped from the action space indices. Therefore, the mapping involves filtering the indices from the action space to only include those corresponding to valid proper divisors of `N`, as determined by the `valid_moves` function.
