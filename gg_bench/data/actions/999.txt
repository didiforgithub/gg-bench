In the game environment, the action space is represented as a `spaces.Discrete(49)`, where each action index corresponds to a possible number choice from 2 to 50, inclusive. The mapping is straightforward: action index `0` corresponds to selecting the number `2`, action index `1` corresponds to selecting `3`, and so on, up to action index `48`, which corresponds to selecting the number `50`. Therefore, if a player chooses an action with index `i`, they are selecting the number `i + 2` from the pool.
