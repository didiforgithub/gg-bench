# Capture the Flag

## Objective

Capture the opponent's flag by moving your token across the board to their flag position. The first player to reach the opponent's flag wins the game.

## Setup

- **Game Board**: A linear board consisting of 11 consecutive positions numbered from `-5` to `+5`.
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1** begins with their token on position `-5` (their own flag).
  - **Player 2** begins with their token on position `+5` (their own flag).
- **Initial Conditions**:
  - Both players' tokens are placed on their respective flag positions.
  - The board is empty except for the two tokens.

## Game Components

- **Linear Board**: Represents the path between the two flags, with positions numbered from `-5` to `+5`.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token that represents their current position on the board.
  - **Appearance**: Simple identifiers, such as `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2.
- **Positions**:
  - Positions `-5` and `+5` are the flag positions.
  - Positions `-4` to `+4` are the path between the flags.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately. Decide who goes first randomly or by mutual agreement.
- **Player Actions on Their Turn**:
  1. **Movement**: Move your token **forward** toward the opponent's flag by `1`, `2`, or `3` positions.
     - Player 1 moves in the positive direction (increasing position numbers).
     - Player 2 moves in the negative direction (decreasing position numbers).
  2. **Occupied Positions**: Both players can occupy the same position during the game.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After a player completes their move, the turn passes to the other player.
  - The game continues until one player captures the opponent's flag.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Allowed Moves**: On your turn, you must move your token forward by `1`, `2`, or `3` positions toward the opponent's flag.
  - **Example**: If Player 1 is on position `-5`, they can move to `-4`, `-3`, or `-2`.
- **Direction**:
  - Player 1 moves from negative to positive positions (`-5` toward `+5`).
  - Player 2 moves from positive to negative positions (`+5` toward `-5`).
- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - You cannot move beyond the opponent's flag position.
  - If you are `2` positions away from the opponent's flag, you can only move `1` or `2` positions.

### Winning the Game

- **Capturing the Flag**: If you move your token onto the opponent's flag position (`+5` for Player 1, `-5` for Player 2), you capture their flag and win the game.
- **Encountering the Opponent**:
  - If you land on the same position occupied by the opponent's token, **and you were the last to move to that position**, you capture the opponent's flag and win.
  - **Example**: If both tokens are on position `0`, and it's Player 1's turn, Player 1 can move to position `0` and win the game.

### Additional Rules

- **No Backward Movement**: You cannot move backward toward your own flag.
- **Valid Moves Only**: You must choose a move that is within `1` to `3` positions and does not exceed the opponent's flag.
- **Forfeiting a Turn**: If you cannot make a valid move (which is impossible under normal circumstances), you forfeit your turn.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who captures the opponent's flag wins the game.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use a points-based scoring system; it is a win/loss outcome.
