**Game Title:** Capture Square

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to form a 2x2 square with your markers on a 4x4 grid.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Grid Preparation:**
   - Draw a 4x4 grid comprising 16 cells.
   - Label the rows numerically from 1 to 4 (top to bottom).
   - Label the columns alphabetically from A to D (left to right).
   - Each cell can be referenced by its coordinate (e.g., A1, B3).

2. **Player Assignment:**
   - Two players are required.
   - Decide who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2** (e.g., by coin toss).
   - **Player 1** uses the marker **'X'**.
   - **Player 2** uses the marker **'O'**.

---

### **Game Components**

- **The Grid:**
  - A virtual 4x4 grid that can be represented in the command-line interface.
  - Initially, all cells are empty.

- **Player Markers:**
  - **'X'** for Player 1.
  - **'O'** for Player 2.

- **Coordinates Reference:**
  - Cells are identified by combining the column letter and row number (e.g., B2).

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - **Player 1** takes the first turn.
   - Players alternate turns thereafter.

2. **Actions Per Turn:**
   - On your turn, place your marker (**'X'** or **'O'**) on any empty cell by specifying its coordinate.
   - Only one marker may be placed per turn.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - After a marker is placed, update the grid display.
   - Check for a winning condition (formation of a 2x2 square).
   - If no winner, proceed to the next player's turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Placing Markers:**
   - Markers must be placed on empty cells.
   - Once placed, markers cannot be moved or removed unless during the Sudden Death phase.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - The first player to form a 2x2 square with their markers wins.
   - The square must consist of four markers occupying adjacent grid cells that form a square shape.
   - Squares can be formed anywhere on the grid.

3. **Example of a Winning Square:**
   - Cells **B2**, **B3**, **C2**, and **C3** forming a square.

4. **Sudden Death (If Applicable):**
   - If all cells are filled without a winner, the game enters Sudden Death.
   - Players take turns swapping one opponent's marker with their own.
   - Swap actions continue until a player forms a 2x2 square and wins.

5. **Additional Mechanics:**
   - **Invalid Moves:**
     - Attempting to place a marker on an occupied cell is invalid.
     - Players must choose an empty cell.
   - **Turn Time Limit (Optional):**
     - Implement a time limit per turn to keep the game moving swiftly.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The player who forms a 2x2 square with their markers wins the game.
  
- **No Draws:**
  - The Sudden Death phase ensures that the game cannot end in a draw.
