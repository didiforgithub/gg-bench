In the "Prime Division Duel" gym environment, the action space indices correspond to the list of prime numbers generated up to 100 using the `generate_primes` method. Each action taken by a player is represented by an index in this list, which maps to a specific prime number used to divide the Current Number (N). Valid moves are those whose corresponding prime factor can exactly divide N. For example, if an action index corresponds to a prime number that is a factor of the Current Number, it is a valid move to divide the Current Number by that prime. The action space is discrete, with each index directly mapping to a prime number from the generated list, providing the means to represent game actions through numeric indices.
