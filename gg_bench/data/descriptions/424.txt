**Trail Blazer**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to navigate your Trail Blazer from your base to your opponent's base on a shared 5x5 grid. Strategically block your opponent while carving a unique path to victory. The first player to reach the opponent's base wins the game. If a player has no legal moves remaining, they lose the game.

### **Setup**

1. **Game Board Initialization**
   - The game is played on a 5x5 grid represented in the command-line interface.
   - The grid coordinates are as follows:
     - Rows are numbered from `0` to `4` top to bottom.
     - Columns are numbered from `0` to `4` left to right.

2. **Player Bases and Starting Positions**
   - **Player A (Trail Blazer A)**
     - Base located at the top-left corner `(0,0)`.
     - Starts with their Trail Blazer on their base at `(0,0)`.
   - **Player B (Trail Blazer B)**
     - Base located at the bottom-right corner `(4,4)`.
     - Starts with their Trail Blazer on their base at `(4,4)`.

3. **Initial Grid State**
   - All grid cells are empty except for the starting positions of the players' Trail Blazers.
   - No trails have been created yet.

### **Game Components**

1. **Grid Board**
   - A 5x5 grid that serves as the game board.
   - Each cell on the grid can be in one of the following states:
     - **Empty (`.`)**: The cell has not been occupied.
     - **Trail Blazer A (`A`)**: Occupied by Player A's Trail Blazer.
     - **Trail Blazer B (`B`)**: Occupied by Player B's Trail Blazer.
     - **Trail of A (`a`)**: A cell previously occupied by Player A's Trail Blazer.
     - **Trail of B (`b`)**: A cell previously occupied by Player B's Trail Blazer.

2. **Trail Blazers**
   - Each player controls one Trail Blazer.
   - The Trail Blazer leaves a permanent trail on the grid as it moves.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order**
   - Players take turns alternately.
   - **Player A** takes the first turn.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn**
   - **Move the Trail Blazer**:
     - Move your Trail Blazer to an adjacent unoccupied cell.
     - Allowed movements include horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions.
     - The destination cell must be empty (not occupied by any trail or Trail Blazer).
   - **Trail Creation**:
     - After moving, the cell you leave becomes part of your trail.
     - Mark your trail on the grid (`a` for Player A, `b` for Player B).

3. **Movement Restrictions**
   - You cannot move onto a cell that is occupied by your own trail (`a` or `b`), your opponent's trail, or either Trail Blazer.
   - You must move each turn if a legal move is available.

4. **No Pass Rule**
   - Passing a turn is not allowed.
   - If you have at least one legal move, you must make a move.

5. **Turn Progression**
   - After completing your move and updating the grid, it becomes the opponent's turn.

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Winning the Game**
   - **Victory Condition**:
     - Reach the opponent's base with your Trail Blazer.
     - For Player A, reach cell `(4,4)`.
     - For Player B, reach cell `(0,0)`.

2. **Losing the Game**
   - **No Legal Moves**:
     - If it's your turn and you have no legal moves (all adjacent cells are occupied), you lose the game.

3. **Trail Mechanics**
   - Trails are permanent and block movement.
   - Neither player can occupy a cell that is part of a trail (their own or the opponent's).

4. **Movement Directions**
   - A Trail Blazer can move to any of the eight adjacent cells (including diagonals) provided they are unoccupied.

5. **Grid Boundaries**
   - The grid edges represent the boundaries.
   - Movement off the grid is not allowed.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and block their paths when possible.
- **Balance Offense and Defense**: While advancing towards the opponent's base, be mindful of protecting your own.
- **Control the Center**: Dominating the center of the grid provides more movement options.
- **Avoid Traps**: Be cautious not to corner yourself without legal moves.
