**Game Name:** Target Sum Duel

---

**Objective:**

Be the first player to reach **exactly** the target sum by strategically selecting numbers to add to your cumulative total without exceeding the target. The player who reaches the target sum on their turn **wins** the game. If a player exceeds the target sum, they **lose**.

---

**Setup:**

1. **Decide on a Target Sum:** Players agree on a target sum to reach. The default target sum is **30**.
2. **Determine Turn Order:** Choose which player will take the first turn. This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.
3. **Initialize Totals:** Both players start with a cumulative total of **0**.

---

**Game Components:**

- **Number Pool:** The integers from **1** to **9** inclusive. Each number can be selected multiple times by either player throughout the game.
- **Cumulative Totals:** Each player maintains their own cumulative total, which is updated on each turn.

---

**Turns:**

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- On each turn, a player selects a number from **1** to **9** and adds it to their cumulative total.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Selecting Numbers:**
   - On your turn, you **must** select an integer between **1** and **9** (inclusive).
   - Add the selected number to your cumulative total.
   - There are **no restrictions** on the numbers, and numbers can be reused any number of times.

2. **Cumulative Total Management:**
   - Keep track of your cumulative total after each turn.
   - You **cannot** exceed the target sum. If your cumulative total goes over the target sum after adding your selected number, you **lose** immediately.
   - If your cumulative total is exactly one less than the target sum, you **must** select **1** on your next turn to reach the target sum and win.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your cumulative total reaches **exactly** the target sum on your turn, you **win** the game.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - If your cumulative total **exceeds** the target sum after your turn, you **lose** immediately, and your opponent wins.

5. **Gameplay Continuation:**
   - The game continues until one player wins by reaching the target sum or loses by exceeding it.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Winning:** The player who reaches the target sum exactly on their turn **wins** the game.
- **Losing:** The player whose cumulative total exceeds the target sum **loses** the game.
- In case of multiple rounds or matches, players can keep track of wins, and the player with the most wins is declared the overall winner.

**Strategic Considerations:**

- **Force the Opponent's Hand:** Try to position your opponent so that they have no choice but to exceed the target sum on their next turn.
- **Optimal Number Selection:** Choose numbers that advance you towards the target sum while limiting your opponent's options.
- **Mathematical Planning:** Calculate future moves and possible sums to plan several turns ahead.
