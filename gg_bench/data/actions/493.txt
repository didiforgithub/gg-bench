In the provided gym environment, each action space index corresponds to a possible move by the player, where the index \(i\) represents choosing the divisor \(i+1\). This is because the action space is defined as a discrete space with indices ranging from 0 to max_N-1, mapping directly to divisors from 1 to max_N. For instance, an action with index 0 corresponds to subtracting the divisor 1, while an action with index 4 corresponds to subtracting the divisor 5. This straightforward mapping ensures actions align directly with proper divisors of the current shared number \(N\).
