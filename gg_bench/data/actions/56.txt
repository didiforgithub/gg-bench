The action space indices (0 to 29) in the gym environment map directly to the numbers 1 to 30 in the game. Each index corresponds to a number, with index 0 representing the number 1, index 1 representing the number 2, and so on, up to index 29 representing the number 30. This mapping allows players to select an available number from the list by choosing the corresponding index in the action space.
