In the game environment, the action space consists of discrete actions ranging from 0 to 7. These action indices map to the integers 2 through 9, which players can select for multiplication. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to the number 2, index 1 to the number 3, and so forth, up to index 7, which corresponds to the number 9. The mapping is achieved by adding 2 to the action index. This allows players to choose any integer within the specified range (2-9) during their turn.
