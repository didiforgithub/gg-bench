# Divisor Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

Divisor Duel is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move, thus securing your victory. Players achieve this by strategically selecting proper divisors to reduce the shared number to a prime number or 1 on their opponent's turn.

- **Victory Condition:** You win if your opponent is unable to make a valid move on their turn because the current number is prime (has no proper divisors other than 1 and itself) or equals 1.

## Setup

1. **Initial Number Selection:**
   - Agree on a starting number **N**, which must be a positive integer greater than 1.
   - For a quick game, it's recommended to choose a moderate number (e.g., 30, 48, 60).

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide which player goes first. This can be done by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (**N**):**
  - A positive integer that both players will manipulate throughout the game.
  - Starts at the initial number agreed upon during setup.
  
- **Proper Divisors:**
  - Numbers greater than 1 and less than **N** that divide **N** without leaving a remainder.
  - Excludes 1 and **N** itself.

- **Player Roles:**
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2** alternate turns manipulating the shared number.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors:**
     - At the start of your turn, list all proper divisors of the current **N**.
  2. **Select a Divisor:**
     - Choose one proper divisor **d** from the list.
  3. **Divide and Update:**
     - Divide **N** by **d**: **N = N / d**.
  4. **Announce Move:**
     - Inform the opponent of the chosen divisor and the new value of **N**.
  
- **Turn Progression:**
  - Players alternate turns following the above structure until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must select a proper divisor **d** of the current **N** (where 1 < **d** < **N**) and divide **N** by **d**.
   - **Example:** If **N = 18**, valid divisors are 2, 3, 6, and 9.

2. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If **N** is prime or equals 1 at the start of your turn, and you have no valid proper divisors to choose from, you cannot make a move.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you win.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn because **N** is prime or equals 1, you lose.

5. **Additional Guidelines:**
   - Divisors must be integers greater than 1.
   - Division must result in an integer (no fractional results).

## Scoring

- **Win Tracking:**
  - Keep track of wins if playing multiple rounds.
  - Optionally, assign points for each win and set a target score for an overall match victory.

- **No Point System:**
  - There are no points awarded during individual games, only a win or loss outcome.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Initial Setup:**

- Starting number **N = 60**.
- Player 1 goes first.

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 60
- **Proper Divisors of 60:** 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Selected Divisor:** 6
- **Calculation:** 60 / 6 = **10**
- **Announcement:** "I divide 60 by 6. The new N is 10."

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 10
- **Proper Divisors of 10:** 2, 5
- **Selected Divisor:** 2
- **Calculation:** 10 / 2 = **5**
- **Announcement:** "I divide 10 by 2. The new N is 5."

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 5
- **Proper Divisors of 5:** None (5 is prime)
- **Cannot make a move.**
- **Result:** Player 1 loses because they cannot make a valid move.

---

**Winner:** Player 2

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Below is a sample of how the game might proceed in a command-line interface.

```
Game Start! Initial N is 60.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 60
Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
Enter your chosen divisor: 6
You divided 60 by 6. New N is 10.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 10
Proper Divisors: 2, 5
Enter your chosen divisor: 2
You divided 10 by 2. New N is 5.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 5
5 is prime. No valid moves.
Player 1 cannot make a move. Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Aim for Primes:** Try to leave your opponent with a prime number on their turn.
- **Avoid Small Numbers Early:** Reducing **N** to a small composite number may limit your options later.
- **Calculate Ahead:** Consider potential future moves resulting from your chosen divisor.
- **Divisor Selection:** Choosing the largest or smallest divisor isn't always the best move; analyze the consequences.
