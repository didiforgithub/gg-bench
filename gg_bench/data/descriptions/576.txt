# Factor Frenzy

## Objective

Be the **first player** to reduce the **target number** to **exactly 1** by strategically subtracting its proper divisors on your turns.

---

## Setup

1. **Choose the Starting Target Number (N):**
   - Decide on a starting number for the game. For a quick game, it's recommended to start with **N = 30**.
   - Both players agree on this number before the game begins.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide which player will take the **first turn**. This can be done by a coin toss, random selection, or mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Target Number (N):** The current number that players will reduce. It starts at the agreed-upon starting number.
- **Proper Divisors:** Divisors of the target number excluding 1 and the number itself.
  - *Example:* Proper divisors of 15 are 3 and 5.

---

## Turns

- The game is played in **alternating turns** between the two players.
- On each turn, a player will:
  1. **Identify Proper Divisors:**
     - List all proper divisors of the current target number.
  2. **Choose a Divisor to Subtract:**
     - Select one proper divisor to subtract from the target number.
  3. **Subtract and Update:**
     - Subtract the chosen divisor from the target number to get the new target number.
- The updated target number becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Subtract Proper Divisors Only:**
   - You may only subtract a **proper divisor** of the current target number.
   - **Proper divisors** exclude 1 and the number itself.
   - *Exception:* If the target number is **prime**, see Rule 2.

2. **When the Target Number is Prime:**
   - If the current target number is a **prime number**, you must subtract **1**.
   - This is the only time you can subtract 1.

3. **Valid Moves:**
   - The result after subtraction must be a **positive integer** (> 0).
   - You cannot subtract a number that would reduce the target number to **zero or negative**.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The **first player** to reduce the target number to **exactly 1** **wins** the game.

5. **No Skipping or Passing:**
   - Players **must** make a valid move on their turn if possible.

6. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If a player makes an invalid move (e.g., subtracting a non-divisor), they **lose their turn**, and the opponent gets an **extra turn**.

---

## Scoring

- There is **no point system**. The focus is on achieving the objective.
- The game is **won** by the player who reduces the target number to **exactly 1** according to the rules.

## Examples

### Example Game with N = 30

#### Starting Target Number: 30

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 30: **2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15**
  - Player 1 chooses to subtract **15**.
  - New target number: **30 - 15 = 15**

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 15: **3, 5**
  - Player 2 chooses to subtract **5**.
  - New target number: **15 - 5 = 10**

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 10: **2, 5**
  - Player 1 chooses to subtract **5**.
  - New target number: **10 - 5 = 5**

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - 5 is a **prime number**.
  - Player 2 subtracts **1**.
  - New target number: **5 - 1 = 4**

- **Player 1's Turn:**
  - Proper divisors of 4: **2**
  - Player 1 chooses to subtract **2**.
  - New target number: **4 - 2 = 2**

- **Player 2's Turn:**
  - 2 is a **prime number**.
  - Player 2 subtracts **1**.
  - New target number: **2 - 1 = 1**

- **Result:**
  - **Player 2 wins** by reducing the target number to **1**.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a command-line interface where players input their chosen divisor:

```
Game Start! Target Number is 30.

Player 1's Turn:
Target Number: 30
Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 15
New Target Number: 15

Player 2's Turn:
Target Number: 15
Proper Divisors: 3, 5
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 5
New Target Number: 10

Player 1's Turn:
Target Number: 10
Proper Divisors: 2, 5
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 5
New Target Number: 5

Player 2's Turn:
Target Number: 5
5 is prime. You must subtract 1.
Subtracting 1.
New Target Number: 4

Player 1's Turn:
Target Number: 4
Proper Divisors: 2
Enter a proper divisor to subtract: 2
New Target Number: 2

Player 2's Turn:
Target Number: 2
2 is prime. You must subtract 1.
Subtracting 1.
New Target Number: 1

Player 2 has reduced the target number to 1 and wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate future moves based on the current target number to force your opponent into a losing position.
- **Control Prime Numbers:** Try to bring the target number to a prime when it's your opponent's turn, forcing them to subtract 1.
- **Optimal Subtractions:** When possible, subtract the largest proper divisor to reduce the target number significantly.

## Summary

Factor Frenzy is a strategic, mathematical game that challenges players to think ahead and use their knowledge of numbers and divisibility. It's simple to learn but offers depth for those who enjoy numerical strategy.

Enjoy the game, and may the most strategic mind win!
