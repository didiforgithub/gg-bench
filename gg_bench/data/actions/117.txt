In the given gym environment for the Number Duel game, the action space indices range from 0 to N-1, corresponding directly to the available numbers a player can use for their turn. Each index represents a potential move, with index i mapping to the number i+1 from a player's remaining set. For example, choosing an action with index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 to selecting the number 2, and so forth, up to index N-1 for the number N. This mapping allows players to choose any available number for their attack or defense from their remaining numbers.
