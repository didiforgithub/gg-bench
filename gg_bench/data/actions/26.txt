In the gym environment for Factor Frenzy, the action space consists of 99 discrete actions, corresponding to indices from 0 to 98. These indices map directly to possible divisors (moves) in the game by adding 2 to each index value. Thus, an action index `a` maps to the divisor `a + 2`, representing numbers from 2 to 100. This mapping ensures that each action index corresponds to a potential proper divisor that a player can choose, starting from the smallest possible value (2) and ending at the largest potential divisor for the numbers within the game constraints.
