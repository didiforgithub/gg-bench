In this gym environment, actions are represented by indices 0 through 8, which correspond to choosing numbers 1 through 9 from the shared pool. Each action index `i` maps to the number `i + 1`. This means that if an agent takes action `i`, it selects the number `i + 1` from the pool if it's available. The mapping is straightforward as each index directly adds 1 to determine the associated number chosen in the game.
