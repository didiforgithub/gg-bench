The action space indices in the gym environment correspond directly to the indices of the prime numbers in the `self.primes` list. Specifically, an action index `i` represents selecting the prime number at the `i-th` position in this list. For instance, if a player takes action `0`, they select the prime number `2`; if the action is `1`, they select `3`, and so on up to the action `9` which corresponds to selecting `29`. Each index uniquely maps to one prime number from the pool, and selecting an index marks that prime as taken for the current player.
