# Number Collapse: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

**Be the first player to reduce the shared number to zero on your turn by strategically subtracting proper divisors.**

Players take turns subtracting proper divisors from a shared number. The goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number exactly to zero. If a player cannot make a valid move, they lose the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Initial Shared Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer, known as the **Shared Number**. By default, the starting number is **30**, but players can agree on any positive integer greater than **1** to increase or decrease the game's difficulty.
   
2. **Start Player**: Decide which player goes first. This can be determined by a coin toss, random selection, or mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer value that both players will manipulate during the game. It starts at the initial value agreed upon during setup (default is **30**).

- **Proper Divisors**: These are numbers that divide the Shared Number evenly, excluding **1** and the Shared Number itself. Players will use proper divisors to subtract from the Shared Number.

- **Player Turns**: Alternating turns where each player interacts with the Shared Number according to the game rules.

---

## Turns

1. **Determine Proper Divisors**: At the start of a player's turn, identify all the proper divisors of the current Shared Number (excluding **1** and the Shared Number itself).

2. **Select a Divisor**: The player selects one of the proper divisors.

3. **Subtract the Divisor**: The selected proper divisor is subtracted from the Shared Number, resulting in a new Shared Number.

4. **End Turn**: The turn ends, and control passes to the other player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you **must** subtract a proper divisor (excluding **1** and the number itself) from the Shared Number.
   - If the Shared Number has no proper divisors (i.e., it is a prime number or **1**), and it is your turn, you lose the game.

2. **Proper Divisors**:
   - Proper divisors are positive integers greater than **1** but less than the Shared Number that divide the Shared Number evenly (no remainder).
   - Example: Proper divisors of **20** are **2, 4, 5,** and **10**.

3. **Subtracting Divisors**:
   - Subtract the selected proper divisor from the Shared Number.
   - The result becomes the new Shared Number for the next player's turn.

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces the Shared Number **exactly to zero** on their turn by subtracting a proper divisor, they **win** the game.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move because there are no proper divisors, they **lose** the game.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If there is at least one valid move, they must make one.

6. **No Repeats Necessary**:
   - Players can choose any valid proper divisor on their turn, regardless of previous moves.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: The player who reduces the Shared Number to **zero** on their turn wins the game.

- **Loss Condition**: If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (no proper divisors available), they lose the game.

- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the nature of the mechanics.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Gameplay

**Starting Shared Number**: 30

**Turn-by-Turn Breakdown**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 30
   - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
   - **Player 1 selects**: 5
   - **New Shared Number**: 30 - 5 = **25**

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 25
   - **Proper Divisors**: 5
   - **Player 2 selects**: 5
   - **New Shared Number**: 25 - 5 = **20**

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 20
   - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10
   - **Player 1 selects**: 10
   - **New Shared Number**: 20 - 10 = **10**

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 10
   - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 5
   - **Player 2 selects**: 5
   - **New Shared Number**: 10 - 5 = **5**

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 5
   - **Proper Divisors**: None (5 is prime)
   - **Player 1 cannot make a move and loses the game**.

**Result**: **Player 2 wins** because Player 1 was unable to make a valid move.

### Example 2: Winning by Reducing to Zero

**Starting Shared Number**: 18

**Turn-by-Turn Breakdown**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 18
   - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 3, 6, 9
   - **Player 1 selects**: 9
   - **New Shared Number**: 18 - 9 = **9**

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 9
   - **Proper Divisors**: 3
   - **Player 2 selects**: 3
   - **New Shared Number**: 9 - 3 = **6**

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 6
   - **Proper Divisors**: 2, 3
   - **Player 1 selects**: 6 (Note: Cannot select 6 as it is the number itself)
   - **Player 1 selects**: 3
   - **New Shared Number**: 6 - 3 = **3**

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Shared Number**: 3
   - **Proper Divisors**: None (3 is prime)
   - **Player 2 cannot make a move and loses the game**.

**Result**: **Player 1 wins** because Player 2 was unable to make a valid move.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a simple command-line interface where players input their chosen divisors.

**Game Start**:
- Shared Number: 12

**Player 1's Turn**:
- Shared Number: 12
- Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Prompt: "Player 1, choose a proper divisor of 12: "
- **Player 1 inputs**: 4
- Output: "Player 1 subtracts 4. New Shared Number is 8."

**Player 2's Turn**:
- Shared Number: 8
- Proper Divisors: 2, 4
- Prompt: "Player 2, choose a proper divisor of 8: "
- **Player 2 inputs**: 4
- Output: "Player 2 subtracts 4. New Shared Number is 4."

**Player 1's Turn**:
- Shared Number: 4
- Proper Divisors: 2
- Prompt: "Player 1, choose a proper divisor of 4: "
- **Player 1 inputs**: 2
- Output: "Player 1 subtracts 2. New Shared Number is 2."

**Player 2's Turn**:
- Shared Number: 2
- Proper Divisors: None (2 is prime)
- Output: "Player 2 cannot make a valid move. Player 1 wins!"

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future Shared Numbers and plan your moves to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

- **Avoid Prime Numbers**: Try to leave the Shared Number as a prime number on your opponent's turn, forcing them into a loss if possible.

- **Subtract Larger Divisors**: When advantageous, subtract larger proper divisors to reduce the Shared Number quickly, potentially catching your opponent off-guard.

- **Control the Flow**: Manipulate the Shared Number to guide the game towards numbers where you have a strategic advantage.
