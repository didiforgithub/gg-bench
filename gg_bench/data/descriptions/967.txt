# Number Shove: Rule Book

## Objective

**Be the player who forces the opponent to exceed a hidden target number.**

In **Number Shove**, two players take turns adding numbers to a running total. The goal is to avoid being the player who causes the running total to exceed a secret target number known only to the game. Through strategic choices and deduction, skilled players can outmaneuver their opponents to achieve victory.

---

## Setup

1. **Secret Target Number**: At the start of the game, the computer randomly selects a secret target number between **20** and **30** (inclusive). This number is hidden from both players.

2. **Running Total**: The running total begins at **0**.

3. **Player Order**: Determine who goes first (Player 1) and who goes second (Player 2). This can be decided by agreement or randomly.

---

## Game Components

- **Secret Target Number**:
  - A randomly selected integer between **20** and **30**.
  - Known only to the game system.
  
- **Running Total**:
  - Starts at **0**.
  - Increases as players add numbers during their turns.

- **Allowed Numbers**:
  - On each turn, players can add an integer between **1** and **5** (inclusive) to the running total.

---

## Turns

1. **Player's Action**:
   - On your turn, choose a number between **1** and **5** to add to the running total.

2. **Updating the Total**:
   - The chosen number is added to the running total.
   - The new running total is displayed to both players.

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
   - The game continues until the running total exceeds the secret target number.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Adding Numbers**:
  - Players must choose an integer between **1** and **5** on their turn.

- **Hidden Target**:
  - The exact target number (between **20** and **30**) remains unknown to the players throughout the game.
  - Players are aware of the possible range of the target number.

- **Exceeding the Target**:
  - If a player's move causes the running total to **exceed** the secret target number, that player **loses** the game.
  - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

- **Reaching the Target**:
  - If a player's move results in the running total being **exactly equal** to the secret target number, the game continues.
  - The objective is to avoid **exceeding** the target, not necessarily to reach it.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who **avoids** exceeding the secret target number wins.
  - There is no point system; the game is won by not losing.

- **Losing the Game**:
  - The player whose turn results in the running total going **above** the secret target number loses.

- **No Draws**:
  - Due to the game's mechanics and hidden target, a draw is impossible.
  - The game will always result in a win for one player.

## Example Gameplay

Let's illustrate a sample game to demonstrate how **Number Shove** is played.

### Initial Setup

- **Secret Target Number**: Chosen by the computer (hidden from players). Let's assume it's **24** for this example.
- **Running Total**: Starts at **0**.
- **Players**:
  - **Player 1**: Alice
  - **Player 2**: Bob

### Game Progression

1. **Turn 1**: **Alice**
   - Chooses to add **3**.
   - Running Total: **0 + 3 = 3**
   - Displayed Total: **3**

2. **Turn 2**: **Bob**
   - Chooses to add **5**.
   - Running Total: **3 + 5 = 8**
   - Displayed Total: **8**

3. **Turn 3**: **Alice**
   - Chooses to add **4**.
   - Running Total: **8 + 4 = 12**
   - Displayed Total: **12**

4. **Turn 4**: **Bob**
   - Chooses to add **5**.
   - Running Total: **12 + 5 = 17**
   - Displayed Total: **17**

5. **Turn 5**: **Alice**
   - Chooses to add **4**.
   - Running Total: **17 + 4 = 21**
   - Displayed Total: **21**

6. **Turn 6**: **Bob**
   - Chooses to add **2**.
   - Running Total: **21 + 2 = 23**
   - Displayed Total: **23**

7. **Turn 7**: **Alice**
   - Chooses to add **1**.
   - Running Total: **23 + 1 = 24**
   - Displayed Total: **24**

   - Note: Total equals the secret target (**24**), but does not exceed it. Game continues.

8. **Turn 8**: **Bob**
   - Chooses to add **2**.
   - Running Total: **24 + 2 = 26**
   - Displayed Total: **26**

   - Since the secret target is **24**, and the running total is now **26** (which exceeds **24**), **Bob** loses the game.

### Outcome

- **Winner**: **Alice**
- **Loser**: **Bob**

## Strategy Tips

- **Deduction**: Pay attention to the running total after each turn to estimate the possible secret target number.

- **Safe Plays**: As the running total approaches **20**, choose smaller numbers to avoid exceeding the target.

- **Forcing Moves**: Try to put your opponent in a position where any move they make could cause them to exceed the target number.

- **Calculations**: Keep track of the minimum and maximum possible target numbers based on the current running total to refine your strategy.
