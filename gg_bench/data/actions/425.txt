In the game, each possible action is represented by an index from 0 to 181 in the action space, where each index corresponds to a unique combination of a position in the word space and a letter from A to Z. The position is determined by integer division of the action index by 26, yielding a result from 0 to 6, which maps to positions 1 to 7 in the word space. The letter is determined by the remainder when the action index is divided by 26, resulting in values from 0 to 25, which correspond to letters A to Z. Each action index thus encodes the specific move of placing a particular letter at a specified position on the board.
