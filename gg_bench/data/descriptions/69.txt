# Grid Runner

## Objective

Be the first player to reach your opponent's starting position on the opposite corner of a 5x5 grid without revisiting any cells. Alternatively, force your opponent into a position where they have no legal moves left.

---

## Setup

- **Grid Size:** The game is played on a 5x5 grid with cells identified by their coordinates `(row, column)`, where `row` and `column` range from 1 to 5.
- **Starting Positions:**
  - **Player 1 (P1):** Starts at the top-left corner `(1,1)`.
  - **Player 2 (P2):** Starts at the bottom-right corner `(5,5)`.
- **Visited Cells:** Each player marks their starting position as visited.

---

## Game Components

- **Grid:**
  - A 5x5 grid represented in the command-line interface.
  - Each cell can be empty, occupied by a player, or marked as visited.
- **Player Tokens:**
  - Represented by `P1` for Player 1 and `P2` for Player 2 on the grid.
- **Visited Cells:**
  - Cells that a player has moved through are marked to indicate they cannot be revisited.
- **Coordinates:**
  - Cells are identified using `(row,column)` notation.

---

## Turns

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **During a Turn:**
  - A player moves to an adjacent unvisited cell.
  - Adjacent cells are those directly above, below, left, or right (no diagonal moves).
  - After moving, the player's previous cell remains marked as visited.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules:**
   - Players can move to any adjacent cell that they have not visited before.
   - Cells cannot be revisited once left.
   - Players cannot occupy the same cell simultaneously.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Victory Condition 1:** Reach your opponent's starting position before they reach yours.
   - **Victory Condition 2:** Create a situation where your opponent has no legal moves on their turn.

3. **Losing the Game:**
   - If you have no legal moves on your turn, you lose.
   - If your opponent reaches your starting position before you reach theirs, you lose.

4. **Draws:**
   - There are no draw conditions; the game continues until one player wins.

5. **Game Notation (for Command-Line Play):**
   - Empty cells are represented by `.`
   - Visited cells are represented by `*`
   - Player positions are represented by `P1` or `P2`

## Strategic Considerations

- **Path Planning:** Balance between the shortest path to the opponent's corner and limiting your opponent's options.
- **Blocking:** Position yourself to restrict your opponent's movement, potentially forcing them into a corner.
- **Resource Management:** Avoid unnecessary moves that consume valuable unvisited cells.

## Additional Rules (Optional Variations)

- **Grid Size Variation:** Play on larger or smaller grids for different difficulty levels.
- **Obstacle Addition:** Introduce obstacles that neither player can pass through.
- **Teleportation Cells:** Designate certain cells that allow players to jump to another location on the grid.
