# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Divisor Duel is a strategic two-player turn-based game centered around number manipulation. Players take turns dividing a shared composite number by its proper divisors, aiming to be the first to reduce the number to a prime number. The player who successfully brings the shared number down to a prime wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a predetermined composite number. For standard play, the starting number is **60**.
2. **Divisors Awareness**: Both players are aware of all proper divisors of the starting number (excluding 1 and the number itself).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A composite integer manipulated by both players throughout the game.
- **Proper Divisors**: Divisors of the current shared number, greater than 1 and less than the number itself.
- **Divisors Used List**: A record maintained during the game to track the divisors that have already been used. Once a divisor is used, it cannot be used again by either player.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first by any fair method (e.g., coin toss).
2. **Player Actions**:
   - On their turn, a player must:
     - Select an unused proper divisor of the current shared number.
     - Divide the shared number by this divisor.
   - The result of this division becomes the new shared number for the next turn.
3. **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Divisors**:
   - Players can only choose proper divisors of the current shared number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
   - The chosen divisor must divide the shared number evenly (no remainders).
   - Divisors cannot be reused once they've been selected in previous turns.
   
2. **Dividing the Shared Number**:
   - Perform the division using the selected divisor to obtain a new shared number.
   - The new shared number must be a positive integer.
   
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces the shared number to a prime number on their turn, they win the game.
   
4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move because there are no unused proper divisors that divide evenly into the shared number, they lose the game.
   
5. **Restrictions**:
   - Players cannot pass their turn; they must make a valid move if possible.
   - If the shared number becomes 1 or cannot be reduced further by the rules, the current player loses.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Achieved by reducing the shared number to a prime number on your turn.
- **Defeat**: Results from being unable to perform a valid division on your turn.

## Examples

### Example 1: Standard Playthrough

**Starting Shared Number**: 60

**Unused Divisors at Start**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **6**.
- **Calculation**: 60 ÷ 6 = **10**.
- **New Shared Number**: 10.
- **Divisors Used**: 6.

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:
- **Unused Divisors**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30.
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **2**.
- **Calculation**: 10 ÷ 2 = **5**.
- **New Shared Number**: 5 (prime).
- **Divisors Used**: 6, 2.
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins**.

### Example 2: Extended Game

**Starting Shared Number**: 60

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **4**.
- **Calculation**: 60 ÷ 4 = **15**.
- **New Shared Number**: 15.
- **Divisors Used**: 4.

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **3**.
- **Calculation**: 15 ÷ 3 = **5**.
- **New Shared Number**: 5 (prime).
- **Divisors Used**: 4, 3.
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins**.

### Example 3: No Valid Moves

**Starting Shared Number**: 50

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **5**.
- **Calculation**: 50 ÷ 5 = **10**.
- **New Shared Number**: 10.
- **Divisors Used**: 5.

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:
- **Unused Divisors**: 2.
- **Action**: Chooses divisor **2**.
- **Calculation**: 10 ÷ 2 = **5**.
- **New Shared Number**: 5 (prime).
- **Divisors Used**: 5, 2.
- **Result**: **Player 2 wins**.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Below is a sample interaction for the game played via command-line:

```
Game Start! Shared Number is 60.

Available Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
Divisors Used: None

Player 1's turn.
Enter your divisor: 5
You chose 5.
60 ÷ 5 = 12
Shared Number is now 12.
Divisors Used: 5

Available Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Player 2's turn.
Enter your divisor: 4
You chose 4.
12 ÷ 4 = 3
Shared Number is now 3.
Divisors Used: 5, 4
Since 3 is a prime number, Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves by considering the possible divisors they may use.
- **Control the Game**: Try to force the shared number into a state where only you have valid moves leading to a win.
- **Avoid Unwanted Primes**: Be cautious not to reduce the shared number to a prime on your turn unless it results in your victory.
