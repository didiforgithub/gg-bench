# **Color Capture**

## **Objective**

Color Capture is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to strategically collect colored tokens to achieve a majority of any one color. A player wins by having more than half of the tokens of a single color by the end of the game. If neither player achieves a color majority, the player with the most total tokens wins.

## **Setup**

- **Token Sequence**: The game begins with a linear sequence of 15 colored tokens arranged in the following repeating pattern:

  ```
  [Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green]
  ```

- **Initial Display**: The sequence is displayed to both players, with positions numbered from left (1) to right (15):

  ```
  Position: 1   2     3     4   5     6     7   8     9    10  11   12   13  14   15
  Token:   Red Blue Green Red Blue Green Red Blue Green Red Blue Green Red Blue Green
  ```

- **Starting Conditions**: No tokens have been collected. Players decide who takes the first turn.

## **Game Components**

- **Tokens**: There are 15 tokens in total:

  - **Red Tokens**: 5 tokens
  - **Blue Tokens**: 5 tokens
  - **Green Tokens**: 5 tokens

- **Token Properties**:

  - **Color**: Each token is identified by its color: Red, Blue, or Green.
  - **Position**: Tokens are positioned in a line and can only be taken from either end.

- **Player Collections**: Each player has a personal collection area to keep their acquired tokens.

## **Turns**

- **Turn Structure**:

  1. **Selection Phase**: The player selects one token from either the leftmost (position 1) or rightmost (position 15) end of the sequence.
  2. **Acquisition**: The selected token is removed from the sequence and added to the player's collection.
  3. **Sequence Update**: The remaining tokens shift accordingly, and positions are updated for the next turn.

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

- **Token Selection**:

  - On their turn, a player must pick one token.
  - Only tokens at the current ends of the sequence (leftmost or rightmost) are available for selection.

- **Objective Strategy**:

  - **Color Majority Goal**: Players aim to collect more than half (i.e., at least 3) of any one color.
  - **Blocking**: Players may also strategize to prevent the opponent from achieving a color majority.

- **End of Game**:

  - The game ends when all tokens have been collected (after 15 turns in total).

- **Winning Conditions**:

  1. **Color Majority Victory**:

     - If a player has collected at least 3 tokens of a single color, they win immediately at the end of the game.

  2. **Total Tokens Victory**:

     - If neither player has a color majority, the player with the most total tokens wins.

  3. **Tie-Breaker**:

     - If both players have the same total number of tokens, the player with the highest number of tokens of any single color wins.
     - If still tied, the second-highest count of tokens of a different color is considered.
     - **No Draws**: Due to the odd number of tokens, a tie is impossible.

## **Scoring**

- **Color Majority**:

  - **Red**: First to collect 3 or more Red tokens.
  - **Blue**: First to collect 3 or more Blue tokens.
  - **Green**: First to collect 3 or more Green tokens.

- **Total Tokens**:

  - Count the total number of tokens in each player's collection.
  - The player with the higher count wins if no color majority is achieved.

## **Command-Line Interaction Example**

Assuming a simple command-line interface where players input commands to select tokens.

### **Prompt Style**

- **Display Remaining Tokens**: Show positions and tokens.
- **Player Input**: Prompt the player to choose a position (leftmost or rightmost).

### **Sample Interaction**

```plaintext
Remaining Tokens:
Position: 1   2     3     4   5     6     7   8     9    10  11   12   13  14   15

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a token from Position 1 (R) or Position 15 (G): 15

You picked Position 15: Green.

Remaining Tokens:
Position: 1   2     3     4   5     6     7   8     9    10  11   12   13  14
Token:    R   B     G     R   B     G     R   B     G     R   B     G     R   B

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a token from Position 1 (R) or Position 14 (B): 1

You picked Position 1: Red.

[...Game continues in this fashion until conclusion...]
```

### **End of Game Summary**

At the end of the game, the command-line interface would display each player's collections and declare the winner.

```plaintext
Game Over!

Player 1's Collection:
- Red Tokens: 2
- Blue Tokens: 2
- Green Tokens: 1

Player 2's Collection:
- Red Tokens: 1
- Blue Tokens: 1
- Green Tokens: 3

Winner: Player 2 wins by collecting a majority of Green tokens!
```

## **Strategy Tips**

- **Planning Ahead**: Anticipate which tokens will become available after your turn to block your opponent's potential majorities.
- **Balance vs. Majority**: Decide whether to block your opponent or focus on building your own majority.
- **Edge Control**: Since you can only pick tokens from the ends, consider how your choice affects the next available tokens.
