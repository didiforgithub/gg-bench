**Zero Hero**

**Objective:**

Be the first player to reduce the shared number to exactly zero by strategically subtracting digits from the current number. The player who achieves this goal wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose.

---

**Setup:**

- **Shared Number:** The game starts with a shared number set at **100**.
- **Players:** Two players are needed, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Starting Player:** Decide who goes first (you can flip a coin, have the youngest player start, etc.).

---

**Game Components:**

- **Shared Number:** A common number visible to both players, starting at **100** and changing as players make moves.
- **Digits for Subtraction:** The individual digits of the current shared number that players can subtract from the shared number itself.
  - For example, if the shared number is **76**, the available digits to subtract are **7** and **6**.

---

**Turns:**

- **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately. The starting player makes the first move.
- **Player Actions During a Turn:**
  1. **Analyze the Shared Number:** Look at the current shared number and identify its digits.
  2. **Choose a Digit to Subtract:** Select one of the digits of the current shared number.
  3. **Subtract the Digit:** Subtract the chosen digit from the shared number.
  4. **Announce the New Shared Number:** State the new shared number aloud for both players to note.
- **Advance to Next Player:** After completing the above steps, the turn passes to the other player.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you **must** subtract **one** of the digits of the current shared number from the shared number itself.
   - The digit chosen for subtraction must come from the current shared number.
     - *Example:* If the shared number is **58**, you can subtract **5** or **8**.
   
2. **Updating the Shared Number:**
   - The result of the subtraction becomes the new shared number.
   - The shared number must always be **greater than or equal to zero** after the subtraction.
   - If a subtraction would result in a negative number, it is an **invalid move**.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If a player reduces the shared number to **exactly zero** on their turn, they **win** the game.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (i.e., they cannot subtract any digit without causing the shared number to go negative), they **lose** the game.
   - Self-Elimination: If a player reduces the shared number to less than zero, they lose.

5. **Additional Rules:**
   - **Digits with Zero:** When the shared number contains a zero digit, zero cannot be subtracted since subtracting zero does not change the shared number. The player must choose a non-zero digit.
     - *Example:* If the shared number is **40**, the digits are **4** and **0**. The player can subtract **4** but not **0**.

---

**Scoring:**

- **Winning the Game:** The player who reduces the shared number to zero wins the game outright.
- **Losing the Game:** The player who cannot make a valid move or causes the shared number to go negative loses the game.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the turn-based structure and the rules for winning and losing.

**Strategic Depth:**

- **Planning Ahead:** Players can anticipate future moves by considering how their subtraction will affect the shared number and what options it will leave for the opponent.
- **Forcing Moves:** By reducing the shared number to certain values, a skilled player can force the opponent into positions with fewer or no valid moves.
- **Avoiding Negative Outcomes:** Players must be cautious not to leave the shared number at a value where they cannot subtract any digits on their next turn.

**Additional Notes:**

- This game is designed to be simple to code and play in a command-line interface.
- There is no possibility of a draw; the game continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.
- The game encourages mathematical reasoning and strategic planning.
- **Example Command-Line Interaction:**

  ```plaintext
  Player 1's Turn:
  Current Number: 76
  Digits Available: 7, 6
  Enter digit to subtract: 6
  New Number is 70
