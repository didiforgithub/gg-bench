# Sequence Master

## Objective

The primary goal of **Sequence Master** is to be the first player to collect **three numbers** that form an **arithmetic sequence**. An arithmetic sequence is a set of numbers where the difference between consecutive numbers is constant. For example:

- **Ascending sequence**: 2, 4, 6 (common difference of +2)
- **Descending sequence**: 7, 5, 3 (common difference of -2)

Players take turns selecting numbers from a shared pool, aiming to form such a sequence before their opponent does.

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: A shared pool containing the numbers **1** through **10**.
- **Player Hands**: Each player starts with an empty hand to collect numbers.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be done by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list or array displaying available numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
- **Player Hands**:
  - **Player 1 Hand**: Stores numbers chosen by Player 1.
  - **Player 2 Hand**: Stores numbers chosen by Player 2.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players interact with the game by entering numbers when prompted.

## Turns

1. **Player Prompt**: The current player is prompted to select a number from the available Number Pool.
2. **Number Selection**:
   - The player inputs a number from the pool.
   - The chosen number is removed from the Number Pool.
   - The number is added to the player's hand.
3. **Sequence Check**:
   - After each turn, the game checks if the player has an arithmetic sequence.
   - If a sequence is formed, the game ends, and that player wins.
4. **Turn Progression**:
   - Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
   - The game continues until a player wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Number Selection**:
  - Players can only select numbers from the current Number Pool.
  - Each number can only be selected once (no repeats).
- **Arithmetic Sequence Formation**:
  - A valid sequence consists of **three numbers** with a constant common difference (positive or negative).
  - The numbers in the player's hand can be in any order.
  - Sequences can ascend or descend.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to have a valid arithmetic sequence in their hand wins immediately.
- **Example of Valid Sequences**:
  - 3, 5, 7 (common difference of +2)
  - 9, 6, 3 (common difference of -3)
  - 4, 4, 4 (common difference of 0) - **Note**: Since all numbers are unique and cannot be repeated, a common difference of 0 is not possible in this game.

## Scoring

There is no point system in **Sequence Master**. The game is won by achieving the objective of forming an arithmetic sequence before your opponent.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Number Pool: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Player 1, select a number: 5

Number Pool: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Player 2, select a number: 2

Number Pool: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Player 1, select a number: 7

Number Pool: [1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10]
Player 2, select a number: 4

Number Pool: [1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10]
Player 1, select a number: 6

Player 1's Hand: [5, 6, 7]
Player 1 has formed an arithmetic sequence!
Congratulations, Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Planning Ahead**: Keep track of which numbers you'll need to form a sequence and prioritize selecting them.
- **Blocking**: Pay attention to your opponent's picks. If you notice they are collecting numbers that could form a sequence, try to select numbers they might need.
- **Flexibility**: Have multiple potential sequences in mind in case some numbers are taken by your opponent.
- **Sequence Variations**: Remember that sequences can be ascending or descending, expanding your options.

## Additional Rules

- **Invalid Input Handling**:
  - If a player selects a number not in the Number Pool, prompt them to choose a valid number.
- **Draw Scenario**:
  - Given the finite set of numbers and the win condition, a draw is impossible in **Sequence Master**.
