In the provided game environment, the action space indices represent potential divisors that a player can select on their turn. Each index from 0 to 100 corresponds to an integer between 0 and 100. Valid moves are integers greater than 1 that divide the current number \( N \) evenly and have not been selected previously. Therefore, action indices directly map to possible divisor choices, with the constraint that valid moves must also satisfy these game rules. An action in the range of valid divisors is executed by using the index as the divisor for the current number \( N \).
