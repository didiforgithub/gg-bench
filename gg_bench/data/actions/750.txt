In the gym environment for the "Number Maze Duel" game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with a size equal to the number of allowed operations. Each index in the action space corresponds to a specific mathematical operation that is allowed during the game. For instance, if there are two allowed operations, such as `+1` and `×2`, the action space indices would map as follows:

- Index `0`: Corresponds to the operation `+1`, which adds 1 to the current number.
- Index `1`: Corresponds to the operation `×2`, which multiplies the current number by 2.

Players select an index as their action, and the environment translates this index into the chosen operation applied to the current number.
