In the provided gym environment, the action space consists of discrete indices from 0 to 50. Each index corresponds to a specific move in the game:

- **Indices 0 to 49**: These indices map directly to the selection of numbers from 1 to 50 in the number pool. Specifically, action index `i` corresponds to selecting the number `i+1` from the pool.
- **Index 50**: This index represents the "pass" action, allowing the player to skip their turn when no valid number meets the last-digit requirement.
