In the game, each action is mapped to an index in the action space, which ranges from 0 to 63. This mapping is organized by two components: move direction and block position. 

1. **Move Direction (First Component):** 
   - The move direction is represented by the integer division of the action index by 16 (`action // 16`), yielding a value from 0 to 3.
   - Each value corresponds to a specific directional move:
     - 0: Move Up
     - 1: Move Down
     - 2: Move Left
     - 3: Move Right

2. **Block Position (Second Component):** 
   - The block position is determined by the remainder of the action index divided by 16 (`action % 16`), resulting in a value from 0 to 15.
   - This value corresponds to one of the empty cells on the 4x4 grid, traversed in row-major order from top-left (0) to bottom-right (15).

Thus, a single action index encodes both the move direction and the specific grid cell to block afterward.
