The action space indices (0-7) directly map to the bit positions (1-8) in the game, where index 0 corresponds to bit position 1, index 1 to bit position 2, and so forth up to index 7, which corresponds to bit position 8. This one-to-one mapping allows players to specify which bit to attack by choosing the corresponding index number in the action space.
