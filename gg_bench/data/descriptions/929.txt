# Zero Sum Showdown

---

## Objective

Be the first player to bring the **cumulative sum** of selected numbers to **exactly zero** on your turn. Use strategic number selection from a shared pool to achieve this goal while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

---

## Setup

- **Cumulative Sum**: Start with a cumulative sum of **0**.
- **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of numbers ranging from **-10 to -1** and **1 to 10**, excluding zero. This results in the numbers:

  ```
  -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
  ```

- **Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., by random selection or agreement).

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list of available numbers for selection.
- **Cumulative Sum**: A running total that updates after each turn.
- **Player Interface**: Command-line prompts for selecting numbers and displaying the current state.

---

## Turns

1. **Player's Turn**:
   - **Display**:
     - The current **cumulative sum**.
     - The **available numbers** in the pool.
   - **Action**: Select **one** number from the pool.

2. **Update**:
   - **Cumulative Sum**: Add the selected number to the cumulative sum.
   - **Number Pool**: Remove the selected number from the pool.

3. **End of Turn**:
   - **Check for Win**: If the cumulative sum is **exactly zero**, the player wins.
   - **Next Player**: If not zero, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Number Selection

- On your turn, you **must** select **one** number from the available pool.
- Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool and cannot be selected again.

### Cumulative Sum Calculation

- The selected number is **added** to the cumulative sum.
  - *Example*: If the cumulative sum is `-5` and you select `7`, the new cumulative sum is `2`.

### Winning the Game

- **Win Condition**: If, after adding your selected number, the cumulative sum equals **zero**, you **win** the game.

### Game Continuation

- If the cumulative sum is **not zero**, the game continues with the next player's turn.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw. If all numbers are exhausted without reaching zero, the **last player to make a move loses**.

### Strategic Play

- Players must anticipate and prevent opponents from reaching a cumulative sum of zero on their turns.
- **Planning Ahead**: Consider the impact of your selection on future moves.

---

## Scoring

- **Victory**: Successfully bringing the cumulative sum to zero on your turn.
- **Defeat**: Failing to prevent the opponent from bringing the cumulative sum to zero, or being the last to move when all numbers are exhausted without reaching zero.

## Examples

### Sample Gameplay

*Let's walk through a sample game between Player 1 and Player 2.*

**Initial State**:

- **Cumulative Sum**: `0`
- **Available Numbers**:

  ```
  -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
  ```

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Selects `5`.
- **Cumulative Sum**: `0 + 5 = 5`
- **Remaining Numbers**: Remove `5` from the pool.

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Selects `-7`.
- **Cumulative Sum**: `5 + (-7) = -2`
- **Remaining Numbers**: Remove `-7` from the pool.

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Selects `2`.
- **Cumulative Sum**: `-2 + 2 = 0`
- **Result**: Cumulative sum is zero. **Player 1 wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Game Start**

```
Current Cumulative Sum: 0
Available Numbers:
-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Player 1, select a number: 5
```

**After Player 1's Turn**

```
Player 1 chose 5
New Cumulative Sum: 5

Available Numbers:
-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Player 2, select a number: -7
```

**After Player 2's Turn**

```
Player 2 chose -7
New Cumulative Sum: -2

Available Numbers:
-10, -9, -8, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Player 1, select a number: 2

Player 1 chose 2
New Cumulative Sum: 0

Player 1 wins! The cumulative sum is zero.
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Monitor the Cumulative Sum**: Always be aware of the current cumulative sum and how your selection will affect it.
- **Block Your Opponent**: Anticipate numbers that could allow your opponent to win on their next turn and avoid setting them up.
- **Plan Ahead**: Think multiple moves ahead to control the flow of the game.
- **Use Negative Numbers Wisely**: Negative numbers can bring the cumulative sum down quickly but may also help your opponent if not used carefully.

Remember, **Zero Sum Showdown** is a game of both calculation and strategy. Each move can open opportunities for victory or create vulnerabilities. Stay sharp and plan your moves thoughtfully to outwit your opponent!
