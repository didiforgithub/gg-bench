In the "Number Tower Duel" game environment, the action space indexes (0 to 8) map directly to the numbered blocks (1 to 9). An action taken by a player corresponds to selecting a block number, such that action index `i` translates to selecting the block numbered `i + 1`. For example, choosing action index `0` corresponds to placing block `1`, action `1` to block `2`, and so forth through action `8`, which corresponds to selecting block `9`. This allows players to choose and attempt to place a specific block based on the rules of the game.
