In the game environment, the action space comprises 50 discrete actions, divided into two sets:

1. **SCAN Actions (Indices 0 to 24):** Each index corresponds to scanning a specific position on the 5x5 grid. Positions are indexed from 0 (A1) to 24 (E5), moving row-wise from A1 to A5, then B1 to B5, and so on up to E5. Selecting an index in this range performs a scan at the corresponding grid location.

2. **GUESS Actions (Indices 25 to 49):** Each index maps to guessing the treasure's location at a specific grid position. Indices 25 to 49 correspond to the same grid positions as SCAN actions, where index 25 corresponds to guessing A1, index 26 to guessing A2, and so forth, up to index 49 for guessing E5.
