# Prime Division Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the shared number to exactly **1** by dividing it by its prime factors. The player who achieves **N = 1** on their turn wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number Selection:**
   - Agree on a starting positive integer **N > 1**. For a quick game, it's recommended to start with **N = 30**.
   
2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):**
  - A positive integer that both players manipulate during the game.
  
- **No Physical Components Needed:**
  - The game is played entirely through calculations and declarations, making it ideal for a command-line interface.

---

## Turns

### Turn Structure:

1. **Announcement:**
   - The current value of **N** is announced at the start of each turn.

2. **Prime Factor Selection:**
   - The active player selects a prime factor of **N** (excluding **1**).

3. **Division:**
   - **N** is divided by the chosen prime factor.
   - The result becomes the new **N**.

4. **Declaration:**
   - The player announces the chosen prime factor and the new value of **N**.

5. **Turn Progression:**
   - Turns alternate between the two players until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules:

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must divide **N** by one of its prime factors greater than **1**.
   - The prime factor must divide evenly into **N** (no remainders).

2. **Updating N:**
   - After division, update **N** to the new value.
   - Example: If **N = 30** and you choose prime factor **5**, then **N** becomes `30 รท 5 = 6`.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - If your move reduces **N** to exactly **1**, you win.
   - The game ends immediately upon reaching **N = 1**.

4. **Prime Number Scenario:**
   - If **N** is a prime number on your turn, your only valid move is to divide **N** by itself.
   - This will always reduce **N** to **1**, potentially securing a win.

5. **Invalid Moves:**
   - Dividing by **1** or a non-prime number is not allowed.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move, they lose their turn (though this situation should not occur with correct play).

### Special Notes:

- **Prime Factor Definition:**
  - A prime factor is a prime number that divides **N** exactly without leaving a remainder.

- **No Skipping Turns:**
  - Players must make a valid move if one is available.

- **No Draws:**
  - The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until **N** is reduced to **1**.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The first player to reduce **N** to **1** wins.
  
- **Tracking Progress:**
  - Keep a record of **N** after each turn to monitor the game's progress.

## Examples

### Example Game Starting with N = 30

#### Initial Setup:

- **N = 30**
- **Player 1** and **Player 2** decide who goes first.

#### Game Play:

1. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current N:** 30
   - **Prime Factors of 30:** 2, 3, 5
   - **Choice:** Divide by **5**
   - **Calculation:** `30 รท 5 = 6`
   - **Announcement:** "I divide by 5. N is now 6."

2. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Current N:** 6
   - **Prime Factors of 6:** 2, 3
   - **Choice:** Divide by **2**
   - **Calculation:** `6 รท 2 = 3`
   - **Announcement:** "I divide by 2. N is now 3."

3. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current N:** 3 (a prime number)
   - **Prime Factors of 3:** 3
   - **Choice:** Divide by **3**
   - **Calculation:** `3 รท 3 = 1`
   - **Announcement:** "I divide by 3. N is now 1. I win!"

#### Outcome:

- **Player 1** wins by reducing **N** to **1**.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start: N = 30

Player 1's Turn
Available prime factors of 30: 2, 3, 5
Enter prime factor to divide N: 5
Player 1 divides by 5. N is now 6.

Player 2's Turn
Available prime factors of 6: 2, 3
Enter prime factor to divide N: 2
Player 2 divides by 2. N is now 3.

Player 1's Turn
Available prime factors of 3: 3
Enter prime factor to divide N: 3
Player 1 divides by 3. N is now 1.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the resulting **N** after your turn.

- **Prime Positioning:**
  - Try to leave **N** as a prime number when it's your opponent's turn to limit their options.

- **Avoiding Traps:**
  - Be cautious of dividing **N** into a small composite number that could allow your opponent to win on their next turn.

---

## Examples of Prime Factors

- **Prime Numbers between 2 and 29:**
  - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

- **Composite Number Example:**
  - If **N = 14**, the prime factors are **2** and **7**.

---

## Variations

### Starting Number Variations:

- **Longer Game:**
  - Start with a larger **N** (e.g., **N = 210**).
- **Shorter Game:**
  - Start with a smaller **N** (e.g., **N = 15**).

### Additional Rules:

- **Forbidden Primes:**
  - Agree to exclude certain primes to increase difficulty.
- **Multiple Divisions:**
  - Allow players to divide by multiple prime factors in one turn (advanced play).

## Conclusion

Prime Division Duel is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to use basic arithmetic and foresight. It's perfect for quick matches and can be easily implemented in a command-line interface, making it both accessible and engaging for players of all skill levels.

Enjoy the battle of wits, and may the best mathematician win!
