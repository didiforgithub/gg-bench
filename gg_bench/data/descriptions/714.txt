# Number Line Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Line Duel** is a strategic two-player game where the primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Players take turns crossing out numbers on a shared number line. The player who makes the last valid move wins the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Number Line Creation**:
   - The game is played with a number line containing the integers from **1 to 10**, arranged sequentially.
   - Initially, none of the numbers are crossed out.

2. **Player Assignment**:
   - Two players are needed: **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Decide who will be Player 1 and Player 2 (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

3. **Starting the Game**:
   - The game begins with Player 1 taking the first turn.

## Game Components

1. **Number Line**:
   - A shared linear arrangement of numbers from **1** to **10**.
   - Example of the initial number line:

     ```
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
     ```

2. **Markers**:
   - A way to indicate crossed-out numbers (e.g., replacing the number with an `X` or enclosing it in brackets).

3. **Players**:
   - **Player 1** and **Player 2**, who will alternate turns.

4. **Interface**:
   - A command-line interface where players input their moves and see the updated number line after each turn.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:
   - Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.

2. **Player Actions**:
   - On their turn, a player must perform one of the following actions:
     - **Cross out one single number**.
     - **Cross out two consecutive numbers** (numbers that are next to each other on the number line and neither is crossed out).

3. **Move Input**:
   - Players input the number or numbers they wish to cross out.
   - Input should be in the form of the number(s), e.g., `5` or `5 6`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The game validates the player's input to ensure the move is legal according to the game rules.

5. **Turn Completion**:
   - After a valid move, the game updates the number line and displays it to both players.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Crossing Out Numbers**:
   - **Single Number**:
     - A player may cross out any **one** number that is not already crossed out.
   - **Two Consecutive Numbers**:
     - A player may cross out any **two numbers** that are adjacent on the number line, provided neither number is already crossed out.
     - Consecutive numbers are numbers that are next to each other in the sequence (e.g., `3` and `4`).

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if:
     - At least one number is crossed out.
     - For crossing out two numbers, they must be consecutive and both unmarked.
   - Players **must** make a valid move if possible; skipping a turn is not allowed.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make any valid move on their turn.
   - The player who made the **last valid move** wins the game.

4. **Illegal Moves**:
   - Attempting to cross out numbers that are already crossed out.
   - Attempting to cross out two numbers that are not consecutive.
   - If an illegal move is attempted, the player will be prompted to try again.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves is declared the **winner**.
- **No Point System**:
  - There is no point accumulation; the game outcome is a win or loss.
- **Game End**:
  - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move.
