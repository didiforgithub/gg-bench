**Game Name:** Divisor Duel

---

### **Objective**

Become the first player to manipulate a shared number so that it is exactly divisible by the target divisor. Players achieve victory by strategically choosing mathematical operations to reach a number divisible by the specified target, thereby demonstrating foresight and planning to outmaneuver their opponent.

---

### **Setup**

- **Starting Number (N):** The game begins with a shared positive integer set to **1**.
- **Target Divisor (D):** A positive integer chosen before the game starts (e.g., **13**). This is the number that players aim to make `N` divisible by.
- **Players:** Two players participate, alternating turns.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N):** A positive integer visible to both players, updated each turn based on player actions.
- **Operations:**
  - **Addition (+1):** Increase `N` by 1.
  - **Multiplication (×2):** Multiply `N` by 2.
- **Display:** A command-line interface displaying the current value of `N`, available operations, and prompts for player input.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:** Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.
2. **Player Actions:** On their turn, a player must choose one of the two available operations to perform on `N`:
   - **Add 1:** `N = N + 1`
   - **Multiply by 2:** `N = N × 2`
3. **Updating `N`:** After the player selects an operation, `N` is updated immediately.
4. **End of Turn:** The turn ends after `N` has been updated and checked for divisibility by `D`.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

- **Allowed Operations:**
  - Players can only choose **one** operation per turn.
  - Operations must result in `N` remaining a positive integer.
- **Winning the Game:**
  - If, after a player's turn, the updated `N` is exactly divisible by `D` (i.e., `N % D == 0`), that player wins the game.
- **Continuation:**
  - If `N` is not divisible by `D`, the game continues, and the next player takes their turn.
- **Prohibitions:**
  - No operation other than the two specified is allowed.
  - Players cannot skip their turn or pass; an operation must be performed.
- **No Draws:**
  - The game continues until one player wins; there is no mechanism for a draw.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory:** The winner is the player who first makes `N` divisible by `D`.
- **No Point System:** There is no point tracking beyond determining the winner of each game.
- **Match Play (Optional):**
  - Players may choose to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of wins to determine an overall champion over several games.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game**

- **Target Divisor (D):** 13
- **Starting Number (N):** 1

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Current `N`:** 1
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 1 × 2 = 2`
- **Decision:** Adds 1 (arbitrary choice since both operations result in 2)
- **Updated `N`:** 2
- **Check for Win:** 2 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current `N`:** 2
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 2 × 2 = 4`
- **Decision:** Multiplies by 2
- **Updated `N`:** 4
- **Check for Win:** 4 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current `N`:** 4
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 4 × 2 = 8`
- **Decision:** Adds 1
- **Updated `N`:** 5
- **Check for Win:** 5 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current `N`:** 5
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 5 + 1 = 6`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 5 × 2 = 10`
- **Decision:** Multiplies by 2
- **Updated `N`:** 10
- **Check for Win:** 10 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Current `N`:** 10
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 10 + 1 = 11`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 10 × 2 = 20`
- **Decision:** Adds 1
- **Updated `N`:** 11
- **Check for Win:** 11 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 6: Player 2**

- **Current `N`:** 11
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 11 + 1 = 12`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 11 × 2 = 22`
- **Decision:** Multiplies by 2
- **Updated `N`:** 22
- **Check for Win:** 22 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 7: Player 1**

- **Current `N`:** 22
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 22 + 1 = 23`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 22 × 2 = 44`
- **Decision:** Multiplies by 2
- **Updated `N`:** 44
- **Check for Win:** 44 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 8: Player 2**

- **Current `N`:** 44
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 44 + 1 = 45`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 44 × 2 = 88`
- **Decision:** Adds 1
- **Updated `N`:** 45
- **Check for Win:** 45 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 9: Player 1**

- **Current `N`:** 45
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 45 + 1 = 46`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 45 × 2 = 90`
- **Decision:** Adds 1
- **Updated `N`:** 46
- **Check for Win:** 46 % 13 == 0 (Since 46 ÷ 13 = 3.538..., but actually 46 ÷13 = 3.538, so this is incorrect; 46 % 13 = 7, so N is not divisible by 13).

Correction: 46 % 13 = 7 (Not divisible). So let's adjust the example.

---

**Turn 9: Player 1**

- **Current `N`:** 45
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 45 + 1 = 46`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 45 × 2 = 90`
- **Decision:** Multiplies by 2
- **Updated `N`:** 90
- **Check for Win:** 90 % 13 ≠ 0 → Game continues.

---

**Turn 10: Player 2**

- **Current `N`:** 90
- **Choices:**
  - Add 1 → `N = 90 + 1 = 91`
  - Multiply by 2 → `N = 90 × 2 = 180`
- **Decision:** Adds 1
- **Updated `N`:** 91
- **Check for Win:** 91 % 13 == 0 (Since 91 ÷ 13 = 7)

**Result:** Player 2 wins by making `N` equal to 91, which is divisible by 13.

### **Strategies for Players**

- **Planning Ahead:** Consider the possible results of both operations to avoid setting up your opponent for a win.
- **Counting Moves:** Keep track of the multiples of the target divisor to aim for a winning number.
- **Forcing Moves:** Manipulate `N` to limit your opponent's options, potentially forcing them into moves that allow you to win on your next turn.

---

### **Ensuring Fair Play**

- **Input Validation:** The game should validate player inputs to ensure they are selecting valid options.
- **Visible Information:** Both players should always be aware of the current value of `N` and the target divisor `D`.
- **Turn Indicators:** Clearly indicate which player's turn it is to prevent confusion.

---

### **Customization Options**

- **Changing Target Divisor:** Players can agree to use a different target divisor for variety or increased difficulty.
- **Starting Number:** For advanced play, start with a different initial `N` to change the game's dynamics.
