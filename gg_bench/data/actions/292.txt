In the game environment, the action space is represented by discrete values ranging from 0 to 9. Each action index corresponds to a move by mapping the action index (0-9) to a number from 1 to 10. Specifically, action index 0 maps to selecting the number 1, index 1 maps to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to index 9 mapping to selecting the number 10.
