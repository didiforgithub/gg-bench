In the game environment, the action space indices map to moves as follows:

1. **Split Phase**: The indices in the action space represent the possible first numbers (`split_option1`) a player can choose to split the `current_number` into two numbers that sum up to `current_number`. Each valid index corresponds to a value between 1 and `current_number - 1`.

2. **Choose Phase**: The indices are 0 or 1, corresponding to selecting the first or the second number from the split options (`split_option1` or `split_option2`) provided by the opponent's split in the previous phase.
