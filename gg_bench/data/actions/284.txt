In the provided gym environment for the game Factor Frenzy, the action space is designed to map each action index to a potential move by representing factors as discrete actions. The action space is defined using `spaces.Discrete(49)`, where the indices from 0 to 48 map directly to selecting factors from 2 to 50:

- Action index `0` corresponds to selecting factor `2`.
- Action index `1` corresponds to selecting factor `3`.
- ...
- Action index `48` corresponds to selecting factor `50`.

This mapping allows players to choose a proper factor of the current number by selecting an action, which is converted to a corresponding factor by adding 2 to the action index. Therefore, the selected factor to subtract is calculated as `action + 2`.
