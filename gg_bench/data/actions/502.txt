The action space indices range from 0 to 19, representing two types of moves for each digit (0-9). Indices 0 to 9 correspond to adding digits 0 to 9 to the beginning of the sequence. Indices 10 to 19 correspond to adding digits 0 to 9 to the end of the sequence. Each index is mapped to a specific digit and its placement (beginning or end) in the shared number sequence.
