## Objective

Be the first player to breach the opponent's firewall by reducing their firewall strength to zero.

- **Victory Condition**: Reduce your opponent's firewall strength to exactly zero before they reduce yours.

## Setup

- **Players**: 2
- **Starting Firewall Strength**: Each player begins with a firewall strength of **10**.
- **Actions Available**: 
  - **Attack**
  - **Bypass**

## Game Components

### Firewall Strength

- Represented by an integer value starting at **10** for each player.
- This number indicates the health of a player's firewall.
- Firewall strength cannot fall below zero.

### Actions

1. **Attack**:
   - **Risky action** with the potential for high damage.
   - Involves a virtual dice roll to determine success.
   - **Success**: Reduces opponent's firewall by **3** points.
   - **Failure**: No damage dealt.

2. **Bypass**:
   - **Safe action** with guaranteed but low damage.
   - **Effect**: Reduces opponent's firewall by **1** point.

### Dice Roll (for Attack)

- A virtual six-sided die generating a random integer between **1** and **6**.
  - **Successful Attack**: Roll a **4**, **5**, or **6**.
  - **Failed Attack**: Roll a **1**, **2**, or **3**.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Decide randomly or by mutual agreement who goes first.
- **Structure of a Turn**:
  1. **Status Update**: Display both players' current firewall strengths.
  2. **Choose Action**: The active player selects **Attack** or **Bypass**.
  3. **Resolve Action**:
     - **Attack**:
       - Perform a virtual dice roll.
       - Apply results based on the roll.
     - **Bypass**:
       - Reduce opponent's firewall by 1.
  4. **Update Firewall Strengths**: Adjust the firewall strengths accordingly.

- **Turn Progression**: Players alternate turns until one player's firewall strength reaches zero.
