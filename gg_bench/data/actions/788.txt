In the "Target Sum" game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, representing numbers 1 through 10 as indices 0 to 9. Each action corresponds to selecting a number from this pool:

- Action 0: Select number 1
- Action 1: Select number 2
- Action 2: Select number 3
- Action 3: Select number 4
- Action 4: Select number 5
- Action 5: Select number 6
- Action 6: Select number 7
- Action 7: Select number 8
- Action 8: Select number 9
- Action 9: Select number 10

The chosen action index maps directly to selecting the respective number from the pool and adding it to the player's total.
