# Digit Conquest

## Objective

Be the first player to create a cumulative number that is **divisible by a target divisor** (e.g., 7) on your turn. Strategic selection of digits and understanding of divisibility are key to victory.

## Setup

1. **Choose a Target Divisor**: Agree on a target number by which divisibility will be tested (e.g., 7). This number should be the same for both players throughout the game.
2. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., flip a coin or mutual agreement).
3. **Initialize the Game**: Start with an empty cumulative number.

## Game Components

- **Digits (1-9)**: Players will use digits from 1 to 9. Digits can be reused, and there is an unlimited supply.
- **Cumulative Number**: A number formed by sequentially appending digits chosen by the players.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Players alternate turns.
  - On each turn, a player performs the following actions:
    1. **Select a Digit**: Choose any digit from 1 to 9.
    2. **Append the Digit**: Add the chosen digit to the right end of the cumulative number.
    3. **Check Divisibility**: Determine if the new cumulative number is divisible by the target divisor.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Appending Digits**:
   - Players must choose a digit between 1 and 9 on their turn.
   - The chosen digit is appended to the cumulative number, building upon the existing sequence.
   - Example: If the cumulative number is `13` and a player appends `7`, the new cumulative number becomes `137`.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Immediate Victory**: If, after appending a digit, the cumulative number is divisible by the target divisor, the player wins the game.
   - **Example**: If the cumulative number is `126` and the target divisor is `7`, since `126 ÷ 7 = 18`, the player who formed `126` wins.

3. **Maximum Length Rule**:
   - **Losing Condition**: If the cumulative number reaches a length of **10 digits** without being divisible by the target divisor, the player who appended the last digit loses.
   - This rule ensures that the game ends in a finite number of moves and eliminates the possibility of a draw.

4. **Digit Selection Strategy**:
   - Players may choose any digit from 1 to 9 on each turn, and digits may be reused.
   - Strategic selection of digits can influence the divisibility of the cumulative number and set up the opponent for a loss.

5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players must make a valid move on their turn and cannot pass or skip a turn.

## Scoring

- **Single Round Play**:
  - The player who wins the round scores 1 point.
- **Multiple Rounds**:
  - Players may agree to play multiple rounds, keeping a tally of points to determine an overall winner after a set number of rounds.

## Examples

### Example Game with Target Divisor 7

**Initial State**:
- Cumulative Number: (empty)

**Gameplay Sequence**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **1**.
   - Cumulative Number: `1`.
   - Divisibility Check: `1` is not divisible by `7`.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **4**.
   - Cumulative Number: `14`.
   - Divisibility Check: `14 ÷ 7 = 2`.
   - **Player 2 Wins!**

**Alternate Extended Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **2**.
   - Cumulative Number: `2`.
   - Not divisible by `7`.

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **5**.
   - Cumulative Number: `25`.
   - Not divisible by `7`.

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **1**.
   - Cumulative Number: `251`.
   - Not divisible by `7`.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **7**.
   - Cumulative Number: `2517`.
   - Divisibility Check: `2517 ÷ 7 ≈ 359.571` (Not divisible).

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses digit **0** (allowed as a special rule if agreed upon).
   - Cumulative Number: `25170`.
   - Divisibility Check: `25170 ÷ 7 = 3596.142` (Not divisible).

6. **...Game continues...**

7. **Player X's Turn**:
   - After several turns, the cumulative number reaches 10 digits.
   - The last player to append a digit loses if the number is not divisible by `7`.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
=== Digit Conquest ===
Target Divisor: 7

Cumulative Number: 

Player 1's turn.
Enter a digit (1-9): 3
Cumulative Number: 3
Not divisible by 7.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a digit (1-9): 5
Cumulative Number: 35
35 is divisible by 7!
Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Understanding Divisibility**:
  - Familiarize yourself with the rules of divisibility for the target number.
  - Use shortcuts and patterns to quickly assess whether a number may be divisible.

- **Setting Traps**:
  - Anticipate potential moves by your opponent and steer the cumulative number into ranges that may force them into a loss.

- **Digit Selection**:
  - Choosing certain digits may make it more difficult for your opponent to win on their next turn.

## Game Variations

- **Different Target Divisors**:
  - Players can agree on a different target divisor to adjust difficulty and strategy (e.g., 3, 5, 11).

- **Limited Digit Use**:
  - Introduce a rule where each digit from 1-9 can only be used a certain number of times to increase complexity.

## Conclusion

Digit Conquest is a simple yet intellectually stimulating game that combines basic arithmetic with strategic planning. It's easy to code in a command-line interface and provides a clear win/loss outcome without the possibility of a draw. With its unique mechanics, it's distinct from traditional games like Go, Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe, or Chess, offering a fresh challenge for players seeking quick and strategic gameplay.

Enjoy your game of Digit Conquest, and may the best strategist win!
