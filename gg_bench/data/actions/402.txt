In the provided gym environment for the game "Sequence Capture," the action space indices map directly to the numbers in the game as follows:

- The action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing numbers 1 through 9, but indexed from 0 to 8.
- Each action index corresponds to selecting a specific number from the Number Pool:

  - Action 0 selects the number 1.
  - Action 1 selects the number 2.
  - Action 2 selects the number 3.
  - Action 3 selects the number 4.
  - Action 4 selects the number 5.
  - Action 5 selects the number 6.
  - Action 6 selects the number 7.
  - Action 7 selects the number 8.
  - Action 8 selects the number 9.

Each index represents a move where a player selects the corresponding number from the pool, assuming it is available (i.e., not yet selected by either player).
