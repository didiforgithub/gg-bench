The action space indices are mapped to moves in the game as follows:

- **Indices 0-24**: Represent the action of placing a marker on a specific cell on the 5x5 grid. The index corresponds to the cell position in row-major order, where index 0 is the top-left cell (0,0) and index 24 is the bottom-right cell (4,4).

- **Indices 25-49**: Represent the action of removing a marker from a specific cell. These indices also correspond to the cell positions in row-major order, where index 25 corresponds to removing a marker from the top-left cell (0,0) and index 49 corresponds to removing a marker from the bottom-right cell (4,4).
