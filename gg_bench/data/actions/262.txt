The action space in the gym environment consists of indices from 0 to 7, representing valid moves in the game. These indices are mapped to multipliers ranging from 2 to 9. Specifically, each action index \( a \) is translated into the multiplier \( a + 2 \). Thus, index 0 corresponds to a multiplier of 2, index 1 to a multiplier of 3, and so on, up to index 7 which corresponds to a multiplier of 9. This mapping allows players to choose multipliers relevant to the game's rules using action indices.
