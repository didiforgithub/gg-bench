The action space in the game consists of 14 discrete actions, representing all possible index-operation combinations for a move. Each index in the array (0 to 6) has two corresponding actions: increment and decrement. Actions are mapped such that the action index is calculated as `2 * index + operation`, where `operation` is `0` for increment and `1` for decrement. Thus, for each index `i` in the array:

- Action `2 * i` represents incrementing the value at index `i` by 1.
- Action `2 * i + 1` represents decrementing the value at index `i` by 1.
