**Game Title: Sequence Duel**

---

### **Objective**

Be the last player able to remove a number from the sequence by strategically selecting numbers according to the game's divisibility and multiplicity rules. The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Initial Sequence:**
   - Create a sequence of consecutive integers from **1** to **20**.
   - Example: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20`.

2. **Player Assignment:**
   - Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by a coin toss).

3. **Starting Conditions:**
   - No numbers have been removed yet.
   - Both players have full visibility of the sequence.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number Sequence:** A list of numbers from **1** to **20** displayed to both players.
  - The sequence represents the pool of available numbers for selection.
  - Numbers are removed from this sequence as the game progresses.

- **Players:**
  - Each player takes turns removing numbers from the sequence.
  - No physical pieces or tokens are required.

---

### **Turns**

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
   - On each turn, a player removes **one** valid number from the sequence.

2. **Order of Actions on a Turn:**
   - **Display the Sequence:** The current sequence of available numbers is shown.
   - **Show Last Number Removed:** Inform the player of the last number removed by the opponent (except on the first turn).
   - **Valid Numbers Calculation:** Determine and display valid numbers that can be removed based on the game's rules.
   - **Player's Choice:** The player selects a number to remove from the valid options.
   - **Update Sequence:** The chosen number is removed from the sequence.

3. **Turn Progression:**
   - The turn passes to the next player after a number is removed.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **First Turn:**
   - **Player 1** may remove **any number** from the initial sequence.

2. **Subsequent Turns:**
   - A player must remove a number that is either:
     - **A Divisor** of the last number removed by the opponent.
     - **A Multiple** of the last number removed by the opponent.

3. **Valid Number Selection:**
   - The chosen number must still be present in the current sequence.
   - If no valid numbers are available, the player loses the game.

4. **Number Removal:**
   - Once a number is removed, it cannot be selected again by either player.
   - The sequence is updated accordingly after each turn.

5. **Winning the Game:**
   - The **winner** is the last player to successfully remove a number according to the rules.
   - The **loser** is the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn.

6. **Example of Divisibility and Multiplicity:**
   - If the last number removed was **4**, valid numbers to remove are any remaining numbers that:
     - Divide **4** evenly (e.g., **1**, **2**).
     - Are multiples of **4** (e.g., **8**, **12**, **16**, **20**).

---

### **Scoring**

- The game is scored as a **win** or **loss**.
- There are no points or cumulative scoring; each game is independent.
- The objective is to win more games if playing multiple rounds.

- **Control the Game Flow:** Remove numbers that minimize your opponent's options on their next turn.
- **Key Numbers to Consider:**
  - **Prime Numbers:** May limit future options due to fewer divisibility relationships.
  - **Numbers with Multiple Divisors or Multiples:** Can provide more options on your future turns.
