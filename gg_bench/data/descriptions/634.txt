# Power Play: Game Rule Book

## Objective
**Power Play** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players aim to be the first to reduce a shared number to **1** by dividing it by its prime factors. The player who reduces the number to **1** on their turn wins the game.

---

## Setup
- **Starting Number (\(N\))**: Both players agree on a starting composite number greater than **1**. This number should have at least two prime factors to allow strategic gameplay (e.g., \(N = 30\)).
- **Player Assignment**: Decide which player goes first. This can be determined randomly (e.g., coin toss) or by mutual agreement.
- **Game Interface**: The game is played in a command-line interface where players input their moves when prompted.

---

## Game Components

### Shared Number (\(N\))
- A positive integer that both players manipulate during the game.
- Updated each turn based on players' actions.
- Initially set to the agreed-upon starting number.

### Prime Factors
- Prime numbers that divide \(N\) exactly (no remainder).
- At each turn, players consider the current prime factors of \(N\) for valid moves.

### Players
- **Player 1** and **Player 2** take turns manipulating \(N\).
- Each player inputs commands through the command-line interface.

---

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Display Current Number**: The game shows the current value of \(N\).
2. **List Prime Factors**: The game calculates and displays all prime factors of \(N\).
3. **Player's Move**:
   - The current player selects one prime factor to divide \(N\) by.
   - Input is provided through the command line.
4. **Update Number**:
   - \(N\) is divided by the chosen prime factor.
   - The result becomes the new \(N\).
5. **Announce Move**:
   - The game displays the chosen prime factor and the new value of \(N\).
6. **Check for Win Condition**:
   - If \(N\) has been reduced to **1**, the current player wins.
7. **Next Turn**:
   - If the game hasn't ended, the turn passes to the other player.

### Example Turn

```plaintext
Current N is 18.
Prime factors are: 2, 3
Player 1, choose a prime factor to divide N by: 2
Player 1 divides N by 2.
New N is 9.
```

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

- **Valid Moves**:
  - On their turn, a player must divide \(N\) by one of its current prime factors.
  - The division must result in an integer (no fractions or decimals).
- **Prime Factors**:
  - Prime factors are recalculated each turn based on the current \(N\).
  - Only current prime factors can be used; previously used factors may or may not be available depending on the new \(N\).
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to reduce \(N\) to **1** on their turn wins.
- **Invalid Moves**:
  - If a player attempts to divide \(N\) by a number that is not a prime factor, they must choose again.
  - Repeated invalid inputs can be penalized by passing the turn to the opponent (optional rule for penalty).

### Special Conditions

- **No Available Prime Factors**:
  - Since \(N\) will always have at least one prime factor (itself if prime), the game continues until \(N\) is reduced to **1**.
- **Prime Numbers**:
  - If \(N\) is a prime number greater than **1**, the only valid move is to divide it by itself.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who reduces \(N\) to **1** wins the game.
- **No Point System**: There is no cumulative scoring; each game is a standalone win or loss.
- **Skilled Play**:
  - Strategic selection of prime factors can control the flow of the game.
  - Anticipating the opponent's potential moves is key to winning.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Starting Number \(N = 30\)**

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current \(N = 30\)
   - Prime factors: 2, 3, 5
   - Player 1 chooses **5**
   - \(N = 30 ÷ 5 = 6\)
   - The game announces: "Player 1 divides N by 5. New N is 6."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current \(N = 6\)
   - Prime factors: 2, 3
   - Player 2 chooses **3**
   - \(N = 6 ÷ 3 = 2\)
   - The game announces: "Player 2 divides N by 3. New N is 2."
   
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current \(N = 2\)
   - Prime factors: 2
   - Player 1 chooses **2**
   - \(N = 2 ÷ 2 = 1\)
   - The game announces: "Player 1 divides N by 2. New N is 1."
   - **Player 1 wins!**

### Example Game 2

**Starting Number \(N = 45\)**

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current \(N = 45\)
   - Prime factors: 3, 5
   - Player 1 chooses **5**
   - \(N = 45 ÷ 5 = 9\)
   - The game announces: "Player 1 divides N by 5. New N is 9."

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Current \(N = 9\)
   - Prime factors: 3
   - Player 2 chooses **3**
   - \(N = 9 ÷ 3 = 3\)
   - The game announces: "Player 2 divides N by 3. New N is 3."
   
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Current \(N = 3\)
   - Prime factors: 3
   - Player 1 chooses **3**
   - \(N = 3 ÷ 3 = 1\)
   - The game announces: "Player 1 divides N by 3. New N is 1."
   - **Player 1 wins!**

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
Welcome to Power Play!

Enter the starting number (greater than 1): 50

Player 1 will start first.

---

Current N is 50.
Prime factors are: 2, 5.
Player 1, choose a prime factor to divide N by: 5

Player 1 divides N by 5.
New N is 10.

---

Current N is 10.
Prime factors are: 2, 5.
Player 2, choose a prime factor to divide N by: 2

Player 2 divides N by 2.
New N is 5.

---

Current N is 5.
Prime factors are: 5.
Player 1, choose a prime factor to divide N by: 5

Player 1 divides N by 5.
New N is 1.

Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate how your choice will affect the subsequent moves.
- **Control the Game**: By choosing certain prime factors, you can force \(N\) into a number that limits your opponent's options.
- **Prime Awareness**: Keep track of remaining prime factors to avoid inadvertently giving your opponent the advantage.
- **Odd vs. Even**: Pay attention to whether \(N\) is odd or even after your move, as this affects the available prime factors.

---

## Conclusion

Power Play is a simple yet strategic game that combines basic arithmetic and prime factorization. It's ideal for quick matches and is designed to be easily implemented in a command-line interface. The clear rules and straightforward mechanics make it accessible, while the strategic depth ensures that skilled players can consistently outperform less experienced opponents.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
