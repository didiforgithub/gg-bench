The action space in the game is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing the blocks numbered from 1 to 9. The action space indices (0 to 8) map directly to these block numbers by adding 1 to the index value. Thus, an action index `i` corresponds to choosing the block numbered `i + 1`. For example, an action at index 0 corresponds to selecting block number 1, index 1 corresponds to block number 2, and so on up to index 8, which corresponds to block number 9.
