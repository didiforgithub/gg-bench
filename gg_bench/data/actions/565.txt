The action space index in the game is mapped to moves using the formula `(number_index * (MAX_NUMBER - 1)) + (split_value - 1)`. Each action is a unique index that combines:

1. **Number Index (`number_index`)**: The position of the number to split in the `numbers_list`, determined by dividing the index by `(MAX_NUMBER - 1)`.

2. **Split Value (`split_value`)**: The value into which part of the number is split, determined by modulo operation and adding 1 to ensure it's at least 1. The split value and its complement must sum to the original number selected for splitting.
