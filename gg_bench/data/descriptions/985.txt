# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Divisor Duel is a strategic two-player turn-based game where players take turns reducing a common number by its proper divisors. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where the opponent cannot make a move because the current number has no proper divisors left.

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a starting number **N**, which is randomly chosen between **50** and **100** (inclusive).
- **Player Assignment**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Determine who goes first (e.g., flip a coin or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Current Number (N)**: A shared number that changes throughout the game based on players' moves.
- **Proper Divisors**: Numbers less than **N** that divide **N** evenly (excluding **N** itself).
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen divisors and receive updates through a text-based interface.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Player Actions**:
  - **Select a Proper Divisor**: On their turn, a player must choose a proper divisor of the current number **N**.
  - **Update N**: Subtract the chosen divisor from **N** to form the new current number.
- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with the updated **N**, and the next player takes their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the chosen number is a proper divisor of the current number **N**.
   - Proper divisors are positive integers less than **N** that divide **N** without leaving a remainder.
2. **Subtracting Divisors**:
   - The chosen proper divisor is subtracted from **N** to get a new **N**.
   - Example: If **N** is **60** and a player selects **15**, the new **N** becomes **45** (**60 - 15 = 45**).
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - If the current number **N** becomes **1** or a prime number (with no proper divisors other than **1**), and it's the opponent's turn, the current player wins.
4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player selects a number that is not a proper divisor of **N**, the move is invalid.
   - The player must choose a valid proper divisor or forfeit the game if none are available.
5. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If a valid move is available, it must be made.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who makes the last valid move wins the game.
- **Loss**: The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player wins.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Number (N):** 60

#### Turn 1:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **60**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
  - **Player 1** chooses **15**
  - **N** becomes **45** (**60 - 15 = 45**)

#### Turn 2:
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **45**: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15
  - **Player 2** chooses **15**
  - **N** becomes **30** (**45 - 15 = 30**)

#### Turn 3:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **30**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
  - **Player 1** chooses **15**
  - **N** becomes **15** (**30 - 15 = 15**)

#### Turn 4:
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **15**: 1, 3, 5
  - **Player 2** chooses **5**
  - **N** becomes **10** (**15 - 5 = 10**)

#### Turn 5:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **10**: 1, 2, 5
  - **Player 1** chooses **5**
  - **N** becomes **5** (**10 - 5 = 5**)

#### Turn 6:
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **5**: 1
  - **Player 2** chooses **1**
  - **N** becomes **4** (**5 - 1 = 4**)

#### Turn 7:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **4**: 1, 2
  - **Player 1** chooses **2**
  - **N** becomes **2** (**4 - 2 = 2**)

#### Turn 8:
- **Player 2's Turn**
  - Proper divisors of **2**: 1
  - **Player 2** chooses **1**
  - **N** becomes **1** (**2 - 1 = 1**)

#### Turn 9:
- **Player 1's Turn**
  - **N** is **1**
  - **1** has no proper divisors (since it is not greater than 1)
  - **Player 1** cannot make a valid move
- **Player 2 Wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Starting Number (N): 60

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 60: 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30
Enter your chosen divisor: 15
New N is 45

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 45: 1,3,5,9,15
Enter your chosen divisor: 15
New N is 30

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15
Enter your chosen divisor: 15
New N is 15

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 15: 1,3,5
Enter your chosen divisor: 5
New N is 10

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 10: 1,2,5
Enter your chosen divisor: 5
New N is 5

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 5: 1
Enter your chosen divisor: 1
New N is 4

Player 1's Turn:
Proper divisors of 4: 1,2
Enter your chosen divisor: 2
New N is 2

Player 2's Turn:
Proper divisors of 2: 1
Enter your chosen divisor: 1
New N is 1

Player 1's Turn:
No valid moves available.
Player 2 Wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves by considering the resulting **N** after your move.
- **Avoid Leaving Prime Numbers**: Try not to reduce **N** to a prime number (other than 2) on your turn, as it leaves fewer options for your opponent.
- **Control the Game Flow**: Use larger proper divisors when it benefits you, especially if it forces your opponent into a losing position.
