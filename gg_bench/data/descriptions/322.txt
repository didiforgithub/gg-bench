**Game Name:** Adjacent Numbers

---

### **Objective**

Be the player to pick the last number from a shared list of numbers, following specific adjacency rules. The goal is to outmaneuver your opponent by strategically selecting numbers that limit their options, ultimately forcing them into a position where you can claim the final number and secure victory.

---

### **Setup**

- **Number List:** A sequential list of integers from **1 to 20**.
- **Player Order:** Determine who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2** (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Number List (1-20):** This is the central element of the game. Numbers are selected from this list and are removed once picked.
- **Player Selections:** Each player maintains a record of the numbers they have picked.
- **Opponent's Numbers:** Players need to be aware of the numbers their opponent has picked to apply the adjacency rules.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions During a Turn:**
  1. **Select a Number:** Choose any available number from the list that complies with the adjacency rules.
  2. **Update Lists:** Remove the selected number from the available numbers and add it to your list of picked numbers.
  3. **Inform Opponent:** Announce the picked number so the opponent can update their records.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection:**
   - On your turn, you may pick any **remaining number** from the list **1 to 20**.
   
2. **Adjacency Restriction:**
   - **You cannot pick a number that is numerically adjacent to any number previously picked by your opponent.**
   - Numerically adjacent numbers are those that are exactly **1 higher or 1 lower** than a number your opponent has picked.
   - For example, if your opponent has picked **10**, you cannot pick **9** or **11** on your subsequent turns.

3. **Unavailable Numbers:**
   - Numbers already picked by either player are no longer available for selection.
   - Keep a shared record of all numbers that have been picked to avoid confusion.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game continues until all numbers have been picked.
   - **The player who picks the last remaining number wins the game.**

### **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition:** Successfully picking the last available number grants you the win.
- **No Points System:** The game does not use a point-based scoring system; victory is based solely on picking the final number according to the rules.
