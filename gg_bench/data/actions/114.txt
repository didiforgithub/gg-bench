The action space indices in the CustomEnv gym environment map directly to the letters of the English alphabet in order, where index 0 corresponds to 'A', index 1 corresponds to 'B', and so on up to index 25 which corresponds to 'Z'. Each index represents the action of selecting the corresponding letter from the shared letter pool during a player's turn. Once a letter is selected using its index, it is removed from the pool and the player takes it into their collection.
