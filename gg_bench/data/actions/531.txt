The action space indices range from 0 to 19, mapping directly to selecting numbers 1 to 20 in the game. Each index represents a specific number: index 0 corresponds to the number 1, index 1 to the number 2, continuing in this manner up to index 19, which corresponds to the number 20. In this setup, choosing an action index is equivalent to selecting the respective number from the pool, allowing players to claim numbers within the game's defined range.
