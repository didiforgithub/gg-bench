In the given environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, where each action index from 0 to 9 corresponds to selecting an even number from the list of numbers 2 to 20. The mapping is as follows: action index `i` corresponds to the number `2 + i * 2`. For example, an action index of 0 selects the number 2, an action index of 1 selects the number 4, and so on, up to an action index of 9 which selects the number 20. This mapping allows players to select numbers based on their indices in the list of available even numbers.
