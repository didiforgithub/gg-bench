In the given environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 30 possible actions (indices 0-29). These actions correspond to combinations of selecting a digit from the digit pool (0 through 9) and placing it in one of the three positions (Left, Middle, Right) on the player's board. Each action is calculated by multiplying the digit index by 3 and adding the position index, where the position indices are 0 for the Left, 1 for the Middle, and 2 for the Right. For example, an action index of 0 corresponds to placing digit 0 in the Left position, action 1 placing digit 0 in the Middle, action 2 placing digit 0 in the Right, and so on up to action 29.
