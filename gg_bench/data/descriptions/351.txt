# Number Nimble

## Objective

**Number Nimble** is a strategic two-player turn-based game played on the command-line interface. The primary goal is to avoid being the player who removes the last available number from the shared pool. Victory is achieved by forcing your opponent into a position where they must pick the final remaining number, thereby securing your win.

## Setup

At the start of the game, a shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9** is displayed in sequence:

```
Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Both players begin with no personal game elements or tokens. There are no initial positions or additional starting conditions.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**: A list of numbers from **1** to **9**, representing the selectable options during the game.
- **Removed Numbers**: A subset of the number pool that have been picked and are no longer available for selection.

There are no physical pieces, boards, or cards. All interactions occur through command-line inputs and outputs.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

- **Players**: Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Actions per Turn**: On their turn, a player must perform the following actions:
  1. **Select a Number**: Choose any one available number from the number pool.
  2. **Remove Numbers**: The selected number and all its factors and multiples in the pool are removed from play.

### Turn Progression

- The game continues with players alternating turns and removing numbers according to the rules until one player is compelled to pick the last remaining number.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Selecting Numbers**:
   - On your turn, you must pick **one** available number from the number pool.

2. **Removing Numbers**:
   - After selecting a number, you remove:
     - The **selected number**.
     - Any other numbers in the pool that are **factors or multiples** of the selected number.

3. **Unavailable Numbers**:
   - Once a number is removed, it cannot be selected or affect future turns.

4. **Objective**:
   - Avoid being the player who must pick the **last remaining number** in the pool.

### Special Conditions

- **No Skipping Turns**: Players cannot skip their turn; they must make a valid selection if possible.
- **Forced Moves**: If only one number remains, the player whose turn it is must select it and, thus, loses the game.

### Interactions Between Components

- **Factors and Multiples**:
  - *Factors* are numbers that divide evenly into the selected number (excluding 1 and the number itself).
  - *Multiples* are numbers that the selected number divides evenly into.
  - In this game, when a number is picked, both its factors and multiples in the current pool are removed.

- **Examples**:
  - Selecting **6** removes **2**, **3**, **6**, and **9** (since 2 and 3 are factors; 6 and 9 are multiples when considering the available numbers).

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - You win by forcing your opponent to pick the last remaining number from the pool.
- **Losing the Game**:
  - You lose if you are compelled to select the final available number.
- **No Point System**:
  - There are no points or scores tracked beyond determining the winner and the loser of the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

#### Game Start

```

Select a number: 7

You picked 7.
Removed numbers: 7
Numbers remaining: 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9
```

#### Subsequent Turns

```
Player 2's turn.
Select a number: 5

You picked 5.
Removed numbers: 5
Numbers remaining: 1 2 3 4 6 8 9

Player 1's turn.
Select a number: 3

You picked 3.
Removed numbers: 3 6 9
Numbers remaining: 1 2 4 8

Player 2's turn.
Select a number: 2

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate which numbers will remain after your turn to avoid being left with the last number.
