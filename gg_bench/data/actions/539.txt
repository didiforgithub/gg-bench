In the CustomEnv gym environment for Stack Attack, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(100)`, where each action index corresponds to placing a number from 1 to 100 on the stack. Specifically, an action index `i` (ranging from 0 to 99) maps to the number `i + 1`. This means the action index 0 corresponds to placing the number 1, index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on, up to index 99, which corresponds to placing the number 100.
