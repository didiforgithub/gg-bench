In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 10 possible actions, corresponding to toggling one of the 10 lights. Each index in the action space (0-9) maps directly to the lights numbered 1-10, respectively. For example, an action with index `0` toggles the light at position `1`, an action with index `1` toggles the light at position `2`, and so forth, up to an action with index `9` which toggles the light at position `10`. This mapping allows players to toggle any light in the game during their turn.
