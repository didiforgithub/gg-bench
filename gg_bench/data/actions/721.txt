In the action space of the custom environment, there are four possible discrete actions, each corresponding to a combination of selecting a number from either end of the shared sequence and performing an operation (addition or subtraction) on that number:

- **Action 0**: Choose the first number from the shared sequence and add it to the player's total.
- **Action 1**: Choose the first number from the shared sequence and subtract it from the player's total.
- **Action 2**: Choose the last number from the shared sequence and add it to the player's total.
- **Action 3**: Choose the last number from the shared sequence and subtract it from the player's total.
