The action space indices in the `CustomEnv` gym environment correspond to the indices of the prime numbers list (`self.primes_list`) sorted up to the maximum starting number `N` (by default, 100). Each action index represents a decision to divide the current shared number `N` by the prime number at that index in the list. When a player takes an action, they select the corresponding prime number to divide `N`. Only the prime factors of `N` from this list can be selected as valid moves, aligning the action space and possible in-game decisions.
