In the environment, the action space consists of discrete indices ranging from 0 to 4. Each index corresponds to an attack value in the game:

- Index 0 corresponds to the attack value 1
- Index 1 corresponds to the attack value 2
- Index 2 corresponds to the attack value 3
- Index 3 corresponds to the attack value 4
- Index 4 corresponds to the attack value 5

This mapping is applied by adding 1 to the selected action index to determine the attack value.
