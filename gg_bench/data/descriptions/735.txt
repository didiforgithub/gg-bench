## Notes on Strategy

- **Control Key Totals:**
  - Aim to make the cumulative total reach numbers that are 5 steps away from 23 (e.g., 18).
  - This can force your opponent into a position where they cannot win without exceeding 23.

- **Anticipate Opponent Moves:**
  - Keep track of possible totals your opponent can create based on their available choices.
  - Plan your moves to limit their options.

- **Stay Within Safe Range:**
  - Avoid bringing the total to a number where your opponent can easily reach 23 on their next turn.
