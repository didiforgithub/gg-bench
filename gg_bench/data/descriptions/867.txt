# Divisor Duel Rule Book

## Objective

The goal of **Divisor Duel** is to be the first player to construct a shared number that is divisible by a predetermined target divisor. Players take turns adding single digits to the end of the shared number, strategically aiming to create a number divisible by the target while preventing their opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

1. **Choose Target Divisor (D):** At the start of the game, both players agree on a target divisor, **D**, which is a positive integer greater than 1 (e.g., 7).
2. **Initialize Shared Number (N):** The shared number, **N**, starts as an empty string or zero value. This number will grow as players append digits during the game.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):** A mutable number that both players build upon by adding digits. It starts empty and grows with each turn.
- **Target Divisor (D):** A mutually agreed-upon positive integer greater than 1. This is the number players aim to create a multiple of.
- **Digits (0-9):** The characters players can append to the shared number **N** during their turn.

## Turns

- **Turn Order:** Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Player Actions on Their Turn:**
  - **Append a Digit:** The player chooses a single digit (0 through 9) and appends it to the end of the shared number **N**.
  - **Update N:** After appending, **N** becomes the new number formed by the existing digits plus the new digit.
- **Turn Progression:** After a player completes their turn, control passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Appending Digits:**
   - Players must append **exactly one** digit to the shared number **N** on their turn.
   - The digit can be any number from 0 to 9.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - If, after a player appends a digit, the new shared number **N** is **divisible by the target divisor D**, that player **wins the game**.
   - **Divisibility Condition:** A number **N** is divisible by **D** if `N mod D == 0`.

3. **Avoiding Divisibility:**
   - Players should aim to avoid making **N** divisible by **D** on their turn unless they are executing a winning strategy.
   - Strategic play involves forcing the opponent into a position where they must make **N** divisible by **D**.

4. **Number Length Limit (Optional):**
   - To ensure the game ends in a reasonable time, players may agree on a maximum length for **N** (e.g., 20 digits).
   - If the maximum length is reached without a winner, the game continues without limits until someone wins.

5. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If a player fails to append a digit or tries to append more than one digit, it is considered an invalid move.
   - Making an invalid move can result in forfeiture, and the opposing player wins by default.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:** The player who creates a shared number **N** that is divisible by the target divisor **D** wins the game.
- **No Point System:** There is no point tracking; the outcome is a win or loss based on the game's objective.

## Examples

### Example 1: Target Divisor D = 7

#### Gameplay Sequence

1. **Initial State:**
   - **N:** (empty)
   - **D:** 7

2. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'3'**.
   - **N:** '3'
   - **Calculation:** 3 mod 7 = 3 (not divisible)
   - No winner.

3. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'1'**.
   - **N:** '31'
   - **Calculation:** 31 mod 7 = 3
   - No winner.

4. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'4'**.
   - **N:** '314'
   - **Calculation:** 314 mod 7 = 6
   - No winner.

5. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'2'**.
   - **N:** '3142'
   - **Calculation:** 3142 mod 7 = 6
   - No winner.

6. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'8'**.
   - **N:** '31428'
   - **Calculation:** 31428 mod 7 = 0
   - **Player 1 wins!**

### Example 2: Target Divisor D = 5

#### Gameplay Sequence

1. **Initial State:**
   - **N:** (empty)
   - **D:** 5

2. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'1'**.
   - **N:** '1'
   - **Calculation:** 1 mod 5 = 1
   - No winner.

3. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'2'**.
   - **N:** '12'
   - **Calculation:** 12 mod 5 = 2
   - No winner.

4. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'3'**.
   - **N:** '123'
   - **Calculation:** 123 mod 5 = 3
   - No winner.

5. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - Appends digit **'5'**.
   - **N:** '1235'
   - **Calculation:** 1235 mod 5 = 0
   - **Player 2 wins!**

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample command-line interaction for **Divisor Duel** with Target Divisor D = 3.

```plaintext
Welcome to Divisor Duel!
Target Divisor (D): 3
Shared Number (N): 

Player 1's turn.
Enter a digit to append: 4
Shared Number (N): 4
4 mod 3 = 1
No winner yet.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a digit to append: 5
Shared Number (N): 45
45 mod 3 = 0
Player 2 wins!
```

In this example, Player 2 wins by creating the number 45, which is divisible by 3.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Modular Arithmetic Mastery:** Players benefit from understanding modular arithmetic to predict the outcome after each move.
- **Forcing Moves:** Skilled players can plan ahead to force their opponent into making the divisible number.
- **Digit Selection:** Choosing which digit to append can set traps or open opportunities for victory.

Remember, the key to **Divisor Duel** is not just in the digits you choose but in anticipating and influencing the cumulative outcome of **N mod D** after each turn.

Good luck, and may the best strategist win!
