The action space indices map to game moves as follows:

- Indices `0` to `10`: Correspond to coloring a single position on the board at positions `0` through `10`, respectively.
- Indices `11` to `20`: Correspond to coloring two adjacent positions on the board. The index `11` corresponds to positions `(0, 1)`, `12` to `(1, 2)`, and so on up to index `20`, which corresponds to positions `(9, 10)`.
