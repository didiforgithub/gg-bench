# Pathway Duel

## Objective
The primary goal of **Pathway Duel** is to be the first player to reach your opponent's starting position on a 5x5 grid while strategically blocking their path. A player also wins if their opponent has no legal moves remaining.

## Setup
- **Grid Configuration**: A 5x5 grid is established, represented by rows and columns numbered from 0 to 4.
- **Starting Positions**:
  - **Player 1** starts at the top-left corner position `(Row 0, Column 0)`.
  - **Player 2** starts at the bottom-right corner position `(Row 4, Column 4)`.
- **Initial Conditions**:
  - All cells are initially empty and unblocked except for the starting positions occupied by the players.

## Game Components
- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid consisting of 25 cells that can be in one of three states:
  - **Empty (`.`)**: Unoccupied and unblocked cells.
  - **Occupied (`A` or `B`)**: Cells currently occupied by Player 1 (`A`) or Player 2 (`B`).
  - **Blocked (`X`)**: Cells that have been vacated by a player and are now impassable.
- **Player Markers**:
  - **Player 1 Marker**: Represented by `A`.
  - **Player 2 Marker**: Represented by `B`.

## Turns
- **Turn Order**: Players take turns alternately, starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Structure**: On a player's turn, they perform the following actions in order:
  1. **Movement**: Move their marker to an adjacent unblocked cell.
  2. **Blocking**: Block the cell they just moved from.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement
- **Adjacent Cells**: Players can move to any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right). Diagonal moves are not allowed.
- **Legal Moves**:
  - A move is legal if the target cell is:
    - Within the bounds of the grid.
    - Not blocked (`X`).
    - Not occupied by the opponent.
- **Forced Loss**: If a player has no legal moves on their turn, they lose the game.

### Blocking
- **Blocking Mechanism**:
  - After moving, the cell vacated by the player becomes blocked.
  - Blocked cells are marked with an `X`.
  - Once a cell is blocked, it remains impassable for the rest of the game.
- **Blocking Strategy**: Players can use blocking to impede their opponent's movement options.

### Winning the Game
- **Victory Conditions**:
  1. **Reaching Opponent's Starting Position**: A player wins if they move onto the cell that was their opponent's starting position.
  2. **Opponent Immobilization**: A player wins if their opponent cannot make a legal move on their turn.

### Game End
- **Conclusion**: The game ends immediately when one player achieves a victory condition.
- **No Draws**: There are no draw conditions in Pathway Duel.

## Scoring
- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game is binaryâ€”one player wins, and the other loses.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tally; the focus is on strategic movement and blocking.
