# Sequence Duel: Rule Book

Welcome to **Sequence Duel**, a strategic two-player turn-based game designed for quick play in a command-line interface. Outsmart your opponent by carefully selecting numbers from a sequence, using factors and multiples to limit their options. Master the sequence, and victory is yours!

---

## Objective

Be the **last player** able to perform a valid move. Players take turns removing numbers from a shared sequence based on specific rules. The player who cannot make a legal move on their turn **loses** the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Determine the Sequence Length (N):** Agree on a maximum number \( N \) to create a sequence from 1 to \( N \). For a quick game, a smaller \( N \) (e.g., 20) is recommended.

2. **Initialize the Sequence:** Generate a list of numbers from **1** to \( N \). This sequence is shared between both players.

3. **Decide the First Player:** Choose who will start the game. This can be done by mutual agreement or a random method.

---

## Game Components

- **Sequence List:** A list of consecutive natural numbers from **1** to \( N \).

  ```
  Example with N=10:
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  ```

- **Player Actions:**

  - **Number Selection:** Picking a number from the sequence based on the game rules.
  - **Turn Tracking:** Keeping track of the numbers previously selected to determine valid moves.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order:** Players alternate turns, starting with the first player.

2. **Turn Structure:**

   - **Select a Number:** Choose a number from the sequence that adheres to the selection rules.
   - **Remove the Number:** The chosen number is removed from the sequence and cannot be selected again.
   - **Update the Game State:** Communicate the selected number to the opponent and display the updated sequence.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **First Turn:**

   - The first player can **remove any number** from the sequence.

2. **Subsequent Turns:**

   - On each turn after the first, the player must select a number that is **either a factor or a multiple** of the **number chosen by the previous player**.

   - **Valid Selection Criteria:**

     - **Factor:** A number that divides evenly into the previous number.
     - **Multiple:** A number that is evenly divisible by the previous number.

   - The selected number must be **still available** in the sequence.

3. **Invalid Moves:**

   - If a player has no valid numbers to select based on the rules, they **lose** their turn and the game.

4. **Example of Valid Moves:**

   - If the previous number was **4**, valid selections are:

     - **Factors of 4:** 1, 2
     - **Multiples of 4:** 8 (if within the sequence and not already removed)

5. **Game End:**

   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The **other player wins** the game.

---

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**

  - The winner is the player who successfully forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

- **No Point System:**

  - Sequence Duel is a win-or-lose game without a point-based scoring system.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a command-line implementation, here's how the interaction might look:

```
Welcome to Sequence Duel!
Sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Alice's turn.
Available numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Enter a number to remove: 6

Sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Bob's turn.
Previous number: 6
Valid options (factors/multiples of 6): [1, 2, 3]
Enter a number to remove: 3

Sequence: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Alice's turn.
Previous number: 3
Valid options (factors/multiples of 3): [1, 9]
Enter a number to remove: 9

... [Game continues as in the example above] ...

Bob's turn.
Previous number: 5
Valid options (factors/multiples of 5): []
No valid moves. Bob loses!
Congratulations, Alice! You win the game.
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Consider the possible numbers available to your opponent after your move.

- **Control the Options:** Try to force your opponent into a position where they have fewer valid moves.

- **Remember Removed Numbers:** Keep track of numbers that have been removed to better predict future valid options.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
