The action space indices in the game map to the number of steps a player can move forward during their turn. Specifically, the mapping is as follows:

- Action index `0` corresponds to moving `1` step.
- Action index `1` corresponds to moving `2` steps.
- Action index `2` corresponds to moving `3` steps.
