In the game, players select numbers from 1 to 9 to construct their pyramids. The action space indices in the gym environment code map directly to these numbers in the following way: An action space index from 0 to 8 corresponds to selecting a number from 1 to 9. Specifically, action index `n` maps to the number `n + 1`. This mapping allows players to choose a number by selecting the corresponding action index during their turn.
