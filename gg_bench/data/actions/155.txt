In the Gridlock game environment, the action space consists of 128 discrete actions, corresponding to all possible moves a player can make. The action is represented by an integer that uniquely encodes the choice of both a token and a grid cell. 

The mapping is as follows:
- Each action integer is divided by 16 to determine which token is being placed; the result (integer division) plus 1 gives the token number (1 to 8).
- The remainder of that division (action modulo 16) provides the target cell index on the flattened 4x4 grid (indices 0 to 15).

Thus, the action space index maps to placing a specific token in a specific cell, where the first part of the index determines the token, and the second part determines the cell.
