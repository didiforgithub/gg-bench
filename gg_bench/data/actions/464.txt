In the Grid Power gym environment, the action space consists of 81 discrete actions, where each action index represents a combination of a power unit and a grid cell. The mapping is as follows:

- Each action index `a` is broken down into two components:
  - `unit_idx = a // 9`, which determines the power unit, ranging from 0 to 8. The power unit is then `unit_idx + 1` (since power units are labeled 1 to 9).
  - `cell_idx = a % 9`, which determines the grid cell index, ranging from 0 to 8.

Therefore, each action specifies placing a particular power unit, identified by its index, into a specific grid cell, identified by its index.
