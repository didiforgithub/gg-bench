In the provided gym environment for the Prime Duel game, the action space is defined by a `Discrete(50)` space, meaning the actions are integers ranging from 0 to 49. Each action index directly corresponds to selecting a number from the number pool of 1 to 50. Specifically, the action index `i` (where `0 <= i < 50`) maps to the move of choosing the number `i + 1` in the game. This mapping allows players to easily select any of the available numbers by choosing the corresponding index in the action space.
