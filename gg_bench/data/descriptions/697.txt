# Number Chain Duel

## Objective

Be the player to successfully place the last number in the chain according to the game's rules. The goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn, thereby securing your victory.

## Setup

- **Starting the Game:**
  - Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by flipping a coin).
  - Begin with an empty number chain.

## Game Components

- **Numbers 1 to 9:**
  - A set of numbers from **1** to **9**.
  - Each number can be used **only once** during the game.

- **Number Chain:**
  - A sequential list where players add numbers on their turns following specific rules.
  - Starts empty and builds up as the game progresses.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - On your turn, you must add **one valid number** to the end of the chain.

- **Actions on Your Turn:**
  - **Select a Number:**
    - Choose an unused number from **1** to **9**.
    - The chosen number must satisfy the placement rules.

- **Progression of Turns:**
  - The game continues with players adding numbers to the chain until one player cannot make a valid move.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Number Selection Rules

- **Unused Numbers:**
  - You can only select numbers that have not been used previously in the game.
  - Once a number is placed in the chain, it is no longer available to either player.

- **Placement Rules:**
  - **First Move:**
    - The first player can choose any number from **1** to **9** to start the chain.
  - **Subsequent Moves:**
    - The number you place must be a **factor** or a **multiple** of the **last number** in the chain.
    - **Factor:** A number that divides evenly into the last number.
    - **Multiple:** A number that is evenly divisible by the last number.

### 2. Valid Moves

- A move is considered valid if:
  - The number has not been used before.
  - The number is a factor or multiple of the last number in the chain.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Winning Condition:**
  - If your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn, you win the game.
- **Losing Condition:**
  - If you cannot make a valid move on your turn, you lose the game.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- The game outcome is determined solely by the win/loss condition.
- The focus is on strategic placement to outmaneuver your opponent.
