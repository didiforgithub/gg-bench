# Pattern Builder

## Objective

Be the first player to collect a set of three numbers that form either an arithmetic or geometric sequence. Players must strategically select numbers from a shared pool to create a valid sequence while preventing their opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

- **Shared Number Pool**: Numbers from **1** to **9**, inclusive.
- **Player Sets**: Each player has their own set of collected numbers, initially empty.
- **Starting the Game**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., coin toss).

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**:
  - Contains the numbers **1** through **9**.
  - Numbers are removed from the pool once selected.

- **Player Sets**:
  - Each player collects numbers from the shared pool.
  - A player's set is visible to both players.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns.
- **On Your Turn**:
  - Choose **one** number from the shared number pool.
  - Add the chosen number to your set.
  - Remove the chosen number from the shared pool.
- Once a number is selected, it cannot be chosen again by either player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Collecting Numbers**:
   - Aim to collect three numbers that can form an arithmetic sequence (a sequence with a common difference) or a geometric sequence (a sequence with a common ratio).
   - The sequence can be in any order; you can rearrange your numbers to form the sequence.

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have **three numbers** in their set that form a valid arithmetic or geometric sequence wins the game.
   - A sequence must consist of exactly **three numbers** from your set.
   - You can declare victory immediately upon completing such a sequence on your turn.

3. **Preventing Opponent's Victory**:
   - Players should also strategize to block their opponent from completing a sequence.
   - Be mindful of the numbers you leave available in the shared pool.

4. **Sequence Definitions**:
   - **Arithmetic Sequence**: A sequence of numbers with a common difference between consecutive numbers. For example, **2, 4, 6** (common difference of 2).
   - **Geometric Sequence**: A sequence where each number after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant called the common ratio. For example, **2, 4, 8** (common ratio of 2).

5. **No Draws**:
   - Since there are 9 unique numbers and each player can collect at most 5 numbers, a win is always possible.
   - The game continues until one player wins; there are no draws.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The player who first forms a valid sequence of three numbers wins the game.
  - No points are accumulated; it's a win/loss outcome per game.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Shared Number Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 1:

- **Player 1** selects **5**.
  - **Player 1's Set**: 5
  - **Shared Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 2:

- **Player 2** selects **4**.
  - **Player 2's Set**: 4
  - **Shared Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9

#### Turn 3:

- **Player 1** selects **7**.
  - **Player 1's Set**: 5, 7
  - **Shared Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9

#### Turn 4:

- **Player 2** selects **6**.
  - **Player 2's Set**: 4, 6
  - **Shared Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9

#### Turn 5:

- **Player 1** selects **9**.
  - **Player 1's Set**: 5, 7, 9
  - **Shared Pool**: 1, 2, 3, 8

- **Player 1** checks for a sequence:
  - **5, 7, 9** is an arithmetic sequence (common difference of 2).
  - **Player 1** declares victory.

### Command-Line Interaction

#### Turn 1:

- **Player 1's Prompt**:
  ```
  Available Numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  Your Set: 
  Choose a number: 5
  ```
- **System Updates**:
  ```
  Player 1 selected 5.
  ```

#### Turn 2:

- **Player 2's Prompt**:
  ```
  Available Numbers: 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
  Your Set: 
  Choose a number: 4
  ```
- **System Updates**:
  ```
  Player 2 selected 4.
  ```

...and so on, until **Player 1** declares victory.

## Strategy Tips

- **Offensive Play**:
  - Identify possible sequences you can create and prioritize picking those numbers.
  - Think ahead to assemble numbers that can form multiple sequences.

- **Defensive Play**:
  - Keep track of your opponent's numbers.
  - Deny your opponent critical numbers needed to complete their sequence.

- **Balance**:
  - Balance between building your sequence and blocking your opponent.
  - Sometimes it's worth sacrificing a potential number for you to prevent an immediate loss.

## Additional Rules

- **Verification**:
  - Upon declaring victory, the sequence must be presented.
  - Both players verify that the sequence is valid (correct common difference or ratio).

- **Disputes**:
  - If there's a disagreement on the validity of a sequence, players can consult a common resource (like a calculator or predefined rules) to resolve it.

- **Time Limits**:
  - To keep the game progressing quickly, consider implementing a time limit per turn (e.g., 30 seconds).

## Conclusion

Pattern Builder is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and adapt to their opponent's moves. With straightforward mechanics suitable for a command-line interface, it's quick to play and emphasizes skill over chance.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
