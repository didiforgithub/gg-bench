# GridLock: A Two-Player Strategy Game

## Objective

GridLock is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played on a 5x5 grid. The primary goal is to be the last player able to legally place a marker on the grid following the placement rules. A player wins by strategically placing markers to block their opponent until the opponent has no legal moves left.

## Setup

- **Grid**: A 5x5 empty grid is displayed at the start of the game. Each cell in the grid is identified by its row and column numbers ranging from 1 to 5.
  
- **Players**:
  - **Player 1**: Uses the marker **'X'**.
  - **Player 2**: Uses the marker **'O'**.

- **Initial State**: The grid is empty, and no markers are placed. Player 1 makes the first move.

## Game Components

- **Grid Cells**: Each cell can be in one of three states:
  - **Empty**: No marker placed.
  - **'X'**: Occupied by Player 1's marker.
  - **'O'**: Occupied by Player 2's marker.

- **Markers**: Symbols representing each player's moves.
  - **'X'**: Represents Player 1's marker.
  - **'O'**: Represents Player 2's marker.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Grid**: The current state of the grid is displayed.
  2. **Player's Move**: The active player selects an empty cell to place their marker, adhering to the placement rules.
  3. **Validation**: The game checks if the chosen cell is a legal move.
     - If legal, the marker is placed, and the turn ends.
     - If illegal, the player is prompted to choose a different cell.
  4. **Check for Legal Moves**: After a marker is placed, the game checks if the next player has any legal moves remaining.
     - If the next player has legal moves, the game continues.
     - If not, the active player wins the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Placement Rules

1. **First Move**:
   - Player 1 can place their marker on any empty cell.

2. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - A player cannot place their marker in any cell that shares the same **row**, **column**, or **diagonal** with any of the opponent's markers already on the grid.
   - Cells that are invalid due to these restrictions are considered **blocked**.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - A player must choose from the remaining unblocked and empty cells.
   - If a player has no valid moves on their turn, they lose the game.

### Diagonals Definition

- **Primary Diagonal**: Cells where the row and column numbers are equal (e.g., (1,1), (2,2), ..., (5,5)).
- **Secondary Diagonal**: Cells where the sum of the row and column numbers is equal to 6 (e.g., (1,5), (2,4), ..., (5,1)).

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: A player wins if their opponent has no legal moves remaining on their turn.

- **No Draws**: There are no draw conditions in GridLock; the game continues until one player wins.

## Scoring

- **Single Game Win**: The winning player is the one who forces their opponent into a position with no legal moves.

- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of wins per player.
  - The player with the most wins after an agreed number of rounds is the overall winner.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

**Start of the Game**

```
Welcome to GridLock!

Player 1 ('X'), it's your turn.
Current Grid:
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+

Enter the row and column to place your 'X' (e.g., 3 3): **3 3**

Player 1 placed an 'X' at (3,3).
```

**Player 2's Turn**

```
Player 2 ('O'), it's your turn.
Current Grid:
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   | X |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+

Blocked cells:
- Rows: 3
- Columns: 3
- Diagonals: primary and secondary

Enter the row and column to place your 'O': **1 2**

Player 2 placed an 'O' at (1,2).
```

**Continuing the Game**

- The game continues with each player taking turns, following the same interaction pattern.
- The program keeps track of blocked cells and informs the players if they attempt to make an illegal move.
- Once a player has no legal moves, the game announces the winner.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider how your move will impact your opponent's options.
- **Control the Center**: Placing markers toward the center can block more cells due to the increased number of shared rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Force Moves**: Try to force your opponent into areas of the grid where they have fewer options.
- **Avoid Isolation**: Be cautious of leaving large areas open for your opponent while limiting your own future moves.

## Conclusion

GridLock is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and outmaneuver their opponent. With straightforward rules and an easy command-line interface, it's quick to learn and play, offering depth and replayability for both casual and competitive players.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
