## Setup

1. **Number List Creation**:
   - Use a predefined sequence of integers, typically numbers from `1` to `9`.
   - Shuffle the numbers randomly to create an unpredictable arrangement.
   - Example Starting List: `[3, 9, 1, 2, 4, 8]`.

2. **Game Display**:
   - Present the shuffled list in a single horizontal line visible to both players.
   - Establish clear labels for the leftmost and rightmost ends.

3. **Determine First Player**:
   - Decide who takes the first turn through mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., coin toss).

4. **Player Areas**:
   - Each player has their own collection area to store the numbers they select during the game.

## Game Components

- **Number List**:
  - A central list of numbers shared between both players.
  - Example: `[3, 9, 1, 2, 4, 8]`.

- **Player Collections**:
  - Individual areas (could be simply a list) where each player keeps their selected numbers.
  - Initially empty for both players.

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - The game is played through text-based commands.
  - Prompts and messages guide the players through their turns.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Players take turns alternately.
  - On each turn, a player must perform the following actions:
    1. **Review Choices**:
       - Observe the current number list and identify the leftmost and rightmost numbers available.
    2. **Select a Number**:
       - Choose **either** the leftmost **or** the rightmost number from the list.
    3. **Update Collections**:
       - Add the selected number to your personal collection.
    4. **Update Number List**:
       - Remove the selected number from the number list.

- **Turn Progression**:
  - The turn ends after a player has selected and removed a number.
  - The next player then takes their turn following the same steps.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection Rules**:
   - Players may only choose from the two numbers at the ends of the number list.
   - Skipping or selecting numbers from the middle of the list is not allowed.

2. **Game Progression**:
   - The game continues until all numbers have been selected and the number list is empty.
   - Each player will have selected the same number of numbers by the end.

3. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players must anticipate future moves and consider the potential choices left for their opponent.
   - Timing and selection can influence the final outcome significantly.

4. **No Draw Mechanism**:
   - In the event of a tie in total scores, the last player to have taken a number is declared the winner.
   - This ensures that every game has a decisive outcome.

## Scoring

- **Calculating Scores**:
  - At the end of the game, each player sums the numbers in their collection.
  - Example:
    - **Player 1's Collection**: `[8, 3, 2]` → Total Score: `13`.
    - **Player 2's Collection**: `[4, 9, 1]` → Total Score: `14`.

- **Determining the Winner**:
  - The player with the higher total score wins the game.
  - If totals are equal, the player who made the last move wins.
