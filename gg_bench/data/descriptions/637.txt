# Divisor Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player game where players take turns reducing a shared number by dividing it by one of its proper divisors. The primary goal is to be the last player to make a valid move. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot make a move because the current number is prime.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Agree on a positive integer to start the game. It is recommended to choose a number with multiple proper divisors (e.g., 60) for a richer gameplay experience.
   
2. **Players**: Two players are required. Decide who will take the first turn, possibly by a coin toss or mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A single positive integer that both players manipulate throughout the game.
  
- **Proper Divisors**: Numbers that divide the current number evenly, excluding 1 and the number itself.
  
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players will input their chosen divisors and view game progress via the command line.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the player designated to go first during the setup.
   
2. **Player Actions**:
   - **Choose a Proper Divisor**: On your turn, select a proper divisor of the current number.
   - **Reduce the Number**: Divide the current number by the chosen proper divisor to get the new current number.
   
3. **Turn Progression**: After a player makes their move, the new current number is announced, and the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if the chosen divisor is a proper divisor of the current number.
   - Proper divisors exclude 1 and the number itself.
   
2. **Prime Numbers**:
   - If the current number is prime (has no proper divisors), the player whose turn it is cannot make a move and loses the game.
   
3. **Forbidden Moves**:
   - Dividing by 1 or the current number itself is not allowed.
   - Choosing a number that is not a proper divisor results in an invalid move. Players must select a valid proper divisor.
   
4. **Game End**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The last player to make a valid move is declared the winner.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
  
- **Match Play**: Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number**: 60

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 60
- **Proper Divisors of 60**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1's Move**: Chooses divisor 4
- **Calculation**: 60 รท 4 = 15
- **New Current Number**: 15

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Current Number**: 15
- **Proper Divisors of 15**: 3, 5
- **Player 2's Move**: Chooses divisor 5
- **Calculation**: 15 รท 5 = 3
- **New Current Number**: 3

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 3 (a prime number)
- **Proper Divisors of 3**: None
- **Player 1's Move**: Cannot make a move
- **Outcome**: Player 2 wins

### Command-Line Interaction

Below is a sample interaction between two players in a command-line interface.

```plaintext
Game Start! The starting number is 60.

Player 1's turn.
Proper divisors of 60: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30]
Enter your divisor: 4
You chose 4. 60 divided by 4 is 15.

Player 2's turn.
Proper divisors of 15: [3, 5]
Enter your divisor: 5
You chose 5. 15 divided by 5 is 3.

Player 1's turn.
The current number is 3, which is prime. No valid moves.
Player 2 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves by considering the resulting numbers from your choice.
  
- **Avoid Prime Trap**: Try not to reduce the number to a prime on your turn unless it forces a win.
  
- **Force Moves**: Lead the game into numbers where your opponent has fewer options.

## Conclusion

Divisor Duel is a game of strategy and foresight. By carefully selecting divisors, players can control the flow of the game and outmaneuver their opponent. Despite its simple rules, the game offers deep strategic possibilities, ensuring that skilled players can consistently outperform less experienced ones.

Enjoy the challenge, and may the best strategist win!
