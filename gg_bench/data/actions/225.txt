In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 9) correspond to the combination of choosing a lock (1 to 5) and increment value (1 or 2) as follows:

- Each lock has two possible actions: increment by 1 or increment by 2.
- Action indices are mapped sequentially:
  - Index 0: Increment Lock 1 by 1
  - Index 1: Increment Lock 1 by 2
  - Index 2: Increment Lock 2 by 1
  - Index 3: Increment Lock 2 by 2
  - Index 4: Increment Lock 3 by 1
  - Index 5: Increment Lock 3 by 2
  - Index 6: Increment Lock 4 by 1
  - Index 7: Increment Lock 4 by 2
  - Index 8: Increment Lock 5 by 1
  - Index 9: Increment Lock 5 by 2

The mapping allows players to select a lock and the amount by which to increment it in a straightforward manner through the action index.
