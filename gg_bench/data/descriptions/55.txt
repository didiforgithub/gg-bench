**Game Name:** Sequence Builder

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to complete a sequence of **four numbers** where each number is greater than the previous one by **exactly 1, 2, or 3**. Utilize strategic number selection to build your sequence while blocking your opponent from completing theirs.

---

### **Setup**

- **Number Pool:** Create a shared pool containing numbers from **1 to 20**.
- **Initial State:** Both players start with an **empty sequence**.
- **Determine First Player:** Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., coin toss, mutual agreement).

---

### **Game Components**

1. **Number Pool (Numbers 1-20):**
   - Represents the available numbers players can select.
   - Each number can be selected **only once** during the game.

2. **Player Sequences:**
   - Each player builds their own sequence of numbers.
   - Sequences are used to track progress toward the objective.

---

### **Turns**

- Players take turns **alternately**.
- **Turn Structure:**
  1. **Select a Number:**
     - Choose any available number from the number pool.
  2. **Update Sequence:**
     - Add the selected number to the **end** of your sequence.
  3. **Check Sequence Validity:**
     - Ensure the new number follows the sequence rule (difference of 1, 2, or 3).

- **Turn Progression:**
  - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player wins or no valid moves remain.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection:**

   - On your turn, you may select **any unselected number** from the pool.
   - Once a number is selected, it is **removed** from the pool and is **unavailable** for both players.

2. **Sequence Building Rules:**

   - **Starting Your Sequence:**
     - If your sequence is empty, you may start with **any number** from the pool.
   - **Adding to Your Sequence:**
     - Each new number must be **greater than** your last number by **exactly 1, 2, or 3**.
       - Example: If your last number is 5, your next number must be **6, 7, or 8**.
     - If no such number is available, you **cannot add** to your sequence that turn.

3. **Winning the Game:**

   - **Primary Win Condition:**
     - Be the **first player** to construct a valid sequence of **four numbers**.
   - **Secondary Win Condition:**
     - If neither player can complete a sequence of four numbers due to exhausted options, the player with the **longer valid sequence** wins.
     - If both sequences are of equal length and no more valid moves can be made, the game is a **draw**.

4. **Blocking Strategy:**

   - Players may select numbers that their opponent might need, hindering their progress.
   - Strategic selection is crucial for both advancing your sequence and impeding your opponent.

5. **Invalid Moves:**

   - If a player selects a number that does not satisfy the sequence rule, they must **choose again**.
   - If no valid numbers are available on your turn, you **skip** your turn.

### **Scoring**

- No points are awarded during the game.
- Victory is achieved by fulfilling the sequence objective.
