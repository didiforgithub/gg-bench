# Race to the Center

## Objective

"Race to the Center" is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a linear track. The primary goal is to be the first player to land exactly on the center position of the track by strategically moving your marker towards the center. Players take turns moving their markers, and must decide whether to move one or two positions each turn. The player who reaches the center position first wins the game. In the event both players reach the center on the same turn, the second player to move in that turn wins, ensuring there is no draw.

## Setup

- **Game Board**: A linear track consisting of 11 positions numbered from **0** to **10**.
- **Player Markers**:
  - **Player 1**'s marker starts at position **0**.
  - **Player 2**'s marker starts at position **10**.
- **Center Position**: The central position is at **position 5**.

The initial setup places both players at opposite ends of the track, equidistant from the center.

## Game Components

- **Linear Track**: A straight line of positions numbered from 0 to 10.
  - Positions are sequential and represent the possible locations for player markers.
- **Player Markers**: Distinct symbols or tokens representing each player on the track.
  - **Player 1**: Represented by `P1`.
  - **Player 2**: Represented by `P2`.
- **Positions**: Numerical identifiers for each spot on the track.
  - Positions **0** and **10** are the starting points.
  - Position **5** is the winning center position.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Player Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must move their marker towards the center by **1 or 2 positions**.
  - Movement is mandatory; a player cannot skip a turn or move 0 positions.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - Each turn consists of one player making their move.
  - The game continues with players alternating turns until the game ends.

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**: Players should plan their moves by anticipating the opponent's options and choosing moves that block or delay the opponent's progress.
- **Turn Order Advantage**:
  - Moving second on a turn where both players can reach the center can be advantageous.
  - Players may force a simultaneous arrival and win by moving second.

*Example Strategy*:

- If you're Player 2 and see that both you and Player 1 can reach the center in the next two moves, you may plan to ensure you move second on the critical turn to secure a win.
