In the "Factor Duel" gym environment, the action space indices correspond to potential factors (greater than 1) of the current number. For each player's turn, the selected action is a factor choice, where the index directly represents the selected factor. Only indices representing valid factors of the current number (i.e., those dividing the number perfectly) result in legitimate moves, which then update the current number to this chosen factor. Any index representing an invalid factor results in an immediate penalty and ends the game.
