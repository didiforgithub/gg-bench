In the custom gym environment for Factor Duel, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(19)`, representing indices 0 to 18. These indices map directly to selecting numbers from 2 to 20 in the game. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to the number 2, index 1 to 3, up to index 18 corresponding to the number 20. A player's action involves selecting a number by its corresponding index in this range, where each index represents the numbers in sequential order starting from 2.
