The action space indices (0 to 12) directly map to the game board positions (1 to 13) respectively. An action taken by the player corresponds to claiming the position on the board that matches the index plus one (e.g., action 0 corresponds to position 1, action 1 to position 2, and so on up to action 12 corresponding to position 13).
