In the game, the action space indices (0 to 6) directly map to the board positions (1 to 7, respectively). When a player takes an action by specifying an index, they are selecting a token at that position to move according to the game's rules. Each action corresponds to moving the chosen token one space forward in the direction designated for the player's turnâ€”right for Player 1 (increasing indices) and left for Player 2 (decreasing indices). This mapping allows players to control their tokens' movements on the linear board based on the index of the position they choose.
