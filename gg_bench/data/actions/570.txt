In the Sequence Stack game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with two possible actions represented by the indices 0 and 1:

- Action 0 corresponds to placing the drawn card in the player's stack, but only if it is the next required number in the player's sequence.
- Action 1 corresponds to discarding the drawn card to block the opponent's ability to use that specific number in their stack.

These actions allow players to either advance their own sequence or strategically block their opponent's progress.
