**Divisor Duel: A Two-Player Command-Line Game**

---

### **Objective**

Divisor Duel is a strategic two-player turn-based game where players take turns reducing a shared number by dividing it by one of its prime divisors. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to exactly **1** on their turn. Victory is achieved by making strategic choices that leave your opponent with no valid moves, forcing them into a loss.

---

### **Setup**

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer, **N**. The recommended default starting number is **60** for a balanced game length, but players can agree on any suitable positive integer greater than 1.
- **Player Positions**: Players decide who takes the first turn. This can be determined by a coin toss, mutual agreement, or any other method of choice.
- **Game Interface**: The game is played in a command-line interface where players input their chosen prime divisors when prompted.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N)**: This is the current number that players will manipulate throughout the game. It starts at the initial value agreed upon during setup.
- **Prime Divisors**: These are the prime numbers that exactly divide the current shared number without leaving a remainder. Only prime divisors greater than 1 are valid.
- **Player Inputs**: On their turn, each player inputs a valid prime divisor of the current shared number.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Structure**:
  - **Prime Divisor Selection**: The active player selects a prime number that is a divisor of the current shared number, **N**.
  - **Number Reduction**: The shared number, **N**, is divided by the selected prime divisor. The result becomes the new value of **N**.
- **Order of Play**: Players alternate turns, with the first player making the initial move.
- **Valid Actions**: On their turn, players must perform the following:
  - Identify all prime divisors of the current **N**.
  - Choose any one of these prime divisors.
  - Divide **N** by the chosen prime divisor to obtain the new **N**.
- **Turn Progression**: The game continues with the new **N** passed to the next player for their turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players must select a prime divisor of the current shared number **N**.
   - The prime divisor must be greater than 1 and exactly divide **N** without leaving a remainder.
2. **Number Reduction**:
   - On each turn, **N** is updated by dividing it by the chosen prime divisor:
     \[
     N_{\text{new}} = \frac{N_{\text{current}}}{\text{Prime Divisor}}
     \]
3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces **N** to exactly **1** on their turn wins the game.
4. **Invalid Moves and Loss Conditions**:
   - If a player cannot find a valid prime divisor greater than 1 (i.e., **N** is already **1** or **N** is a prime number and they cannot divide it further), they lose their turn, and the opponent wins the game.
5. **Special Conditions**:
   - **N** must always remain a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 throughout the game.
   - Players cannot pass their turn; they must make a valid move if one is available.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**: The player who reduces the shared number **N** to exactly **1** on their turn wins the game.
- **Loss**: A player loses if:
  - They cannot perform a valid move on their turn (i.e., there are no prime divisors greater than 1 for the current **N**).
  - They make an invalid input (select a number that is not a prime divisor of **N**).
- **No Draws**: The game is designed to ensure there are no draws; a winner is determined by the gameplay.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Gameplay Overview**

**Starting Number (N):** 60

**Player 1 and Player 2 alternate turns.**

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current N:** 60
   - **Prime Divisors of 60:** 2, 3, 5
   - **Player 1 selects:** 5
   - **Calculation:** \( N = 60 \div 5 = 12 \)
   - **New N:** 12

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current N:** 12
   - **Prime Divisors of 12:** 2, 3
   - **Player 2 selects:** 2
   - **Calculation:** \( N = 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
   - **New N:** 6

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - **Current N:** 6
   - **Prime Divisors of 6:** 2, 3
   - **Player 1 selects:** 3
   - **Calculation:** \( N = 6 \div 3 = 2 \)
   - **New N:** 2

4. **Player 2's Turn**
   - **Current N:** 2
   - **Prime Divisors of 2:** 2
   - **Player 2 selects:** 2
   - **Calculation:** \( N = 2 \div 2 = 1 \)
   - **New N:** 1

**Result:** Player 2 reduces **N** to 1 and wins the game.

#### **Example 2: Command-Line Interaction**

**Starting Number (N):** 45

**Player 1 goes first.**

**Game Start**

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- **Current N:** 45
- **Prime Divisors of 45:** 3, 5
- **Command-Line Prompt:**
  ```
  Player 1, enter a prime divisor of 45: 
  ```
- **Player 1 enters:** `5`
- **Calculation:** \( N = 45 \div 5 = 9 \)
- **Output:**
  ```
  You selected 5. The new N is 9.
  ```

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- **Current N:** 9
- **Prime Divisors of 9:** 3
- **Command-Line Prompt:**
  ```
  Player 2, enter a prime divisor of 9: 
  ```
- **Player 2 enters:** `3`
- **Calculation:** \( N = 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
- **Output:**
  ```
  You selected 3. The new N is 3.
  ```

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- **Current N:** 3
- **Prime Divisors of 3:** 3
- **Command-Line Prompt:**
  ```
  Player 1, enter a prime divisor of 3: 
  ```
- **Player 1 enters:** `3`
- **Calculation:** \( N = 3 \div 3 = 1 \)
- **Output:**
  ```
  You selected 3. The new N is 1.
  ```
- **Result:**
  ```
  Player 1 has reduced N to 1 and wins the game!
  ```

### **Strategies and Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice will affect the remaining prime divisors for your opponent.
- **Prime Awareness**: Familiarize yourself with prime numbers and their factors to make quick and valid decisions.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into a position where the only available moves benefit you or limit their options.
- **Avoid Reducing N to a Prime on Opponent's Turn**: If possible, avoid leaving the shared number as a prime greater than 1 on your opponent's turn, as it gives them an immediate win.

---

### **Game Flow Summary**

1. **Initialize** the shared number **N**.
2. **Player 1** starts the game by selecting a valid prime divisor of **N**.
3. **Update** **N** by dividing it by the selected prime divisor.
4. **Alternate Turns**: Players continue to take turns following the same process.
5. **Win Condition**: The player who reduces **N** to exactly **1** on their turn wins the game.
6. **Loss Condition**: If a player cannot make a valid move when **N** is greater than **1**, they lose the game.
