# Digit Battle Rule Book

## Objective

**Digit Battle** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to reduce your opponent's Life Points to zero by strategically manipulating a shared number according to specific rules. Victory is achieved by carefully selecting digits to alter the shared number, imposing penalties on your opponent while avoiding detrimental effects on yourself.

## Setup

- **Life Points**: Both players start with **10 Life Points**.
- **Shared Number**: There is a shared number accessible to both players, which starts at **0**.

At the beginning of the game, the shared number is displayed as `Current Number: 0`, and both players have their Life Points set:

- `Player 1 Life Points: 10`
- `Player 2 Life Points: 10`

Players decide who will take the first turn, perhaps by a random selection or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Digits (1-9)**: Players will use digits from **1** to **9** to alter the shared number. Digits can be used multiple times throughout the game.
- **Shared Number**: A number that both players modify on their turns according to the game rules.
- **Life Points**: A score representing each player's remaining life. Starts at 10 and decreases based on in-game penalties.

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Display Status**: At the start of each turn, display:
   - Both players' Life Points.
   - The current value of the shared number.
2. **Action Phase**:
   - The active player selects a digit between **1** and **9**.
   - Based on the game rules, the selected digit is either **added to** or **subtracted from** the shared number.
3. **Result and Effects**:
   - Update the shared number with the new value.
   - Apply any penalties or special effects resulting from the move.
4. **Turn Progression**:
   - The turn passes to the next player.

### Example Turn Flow

- **Player 1's Turn**:
  - Current Number: 0 (even)
  - Player 1 selects digit **5**.
  - Adds 5 to the current number (0 + 5 = 5).
  - Updates the shared number to 5.
- **Player 2's Turn**:
  - Current Number: 5 (odd)
  - Player 2 selects digit **3**.
  - Subtracts 3 from the current number (5 - 3 = 2).
  - Updates the shared number to 2.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Digit Selection**:
   - On each turn, a player selects any digit from **1** to **9**.
   - Digits can be reused; there are no limits on the number of times a digit can be selected.

2. **Operation Based on Shared Number**:
   - **If the shared number is even**:
     - The selected digit **must be added** to the shared number.
   - **If the shared number is odd**:
     - The selected digit **must be subtracted** from the shared number.

3. **Resulting Shared Number**:
   - After the operation, the shared number is updated to the new value.
   - The shared number can be positive, zero, or negative.

### Special Conditions and Penalties

1. **Negative Shared Number**:
   - **Penalty to Active Player**:
     - If the shared number becomes **negative** after the player's turn, the **active player loses 1 Life Point**.
     - The shared number remains negative unless reset by game rules.

2. **Reaching 15**:
   - **Penalty to Opponent**:
     - If the shared number becomes exactly **15** after the player's turn, the **opponent loses 3 Life Points**.
     - The shared number is then **reset to 0**.

3. **Over 20 Condition**:
   - **Penalty to Active Player**:
     - If the shared number exceeds **20** after the player's turn, the **active player loses 2 Life Points**.
     - The shared number is then **reset to 10**.

### Winning the Game

- The game continues with players taking turns according to the rules.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to reduce their opponent's Life Points to **0 or below** wins the game.
- **Defeat**:
  - A player loses if their own Life Points are reduced to **0 or below**.

## Scoring

- **Life Points Tracking**:
  - Each player starts with **10 Life Points**.
  - Life Points are decreased based on penalties from the game mechanics.
  - Life Points cannot exceed the starting amount (no healing or bonuses to increase Life Points).
- **Life Points Penalties**:
  - **Lose 1 Life Point**: If the active player's move results in a negative shared number.
  - **Lose 3 Life Points (Opponent)**: If the active player's move results in the shared number becoming exactly **15**.
  - **Lose 2 Life Points**: If the active player's move results in the shared number exceeding **20**.
