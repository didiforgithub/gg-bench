# Factor Duel

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a valid move. Players take turns subtracting proper divisors from a shared number. The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move (i.e., when the current number has no proper divisors) wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number (N)**:
   - Choose a positive integer to start the game. It is recommended that N be a composite number greater than 30 to allow for strategic gameplay.
   - Players can agree upon the starting number or have it randomly selected.

2. **Player Order**:
   - Decide which player will go first. This can be determined by mutual agreement, a coin toss, or random selection by the program if implemented.

## Game Components

- **Current Number (N)**:
  - The shared number that players manipulate during the game.
  
- **Proper Divisors**:
  - Positive integers greater than 1 and less than N that divide N exactly without leaving a remainder.

## Turns

### Turn Order

- Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.

### Turn Actions

On your turn:

1. **Identify Proper Divisors**:
   - List all the proper divisors of the current number N (excluding 1 and N).

2. **Select a Proper Divisor (d)**:
   - Choose one proper divisor from the list.

3. **Subtract the Divisor**:
   - Subtract the chosen divisor from N: `N = N - d`.

4. **Announce Move**:
   - State your chosen divisor and the new value of N.

5. **Pass Turn**:
   - The updated N is now the starting point for the opponent's turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - You must subtract a proper divisor of the current N.
   - Proper divisors are greater than 1 and less than N.
   - The divisor must divide N exactly (no remainder).

2. **Restrictions**:
   - You cannot subtract 1 or N itself.
   - If N has no proper divisors (i.e., it is prime or equal to 2), and it's your turn, you lose.

3. **End of Game**:
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - The player who cannot move loses; the other player wins.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts an invalid move, they must choose again.
   - Repeated invalid attempts may result in forfeiture, depending on agreed rules.

## Scoring

- The game is won by the player who forces their opponent into an impossible move.
- No points are tracked; it's a win/lose outcome.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Number**: N = 30

#### Turn 1 - Player 1

- **Current N**: 30
- **Proper Divisors**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 1 chooses**: 15
- **Calculation**: N = 30 - 15 = 15
- **Announce**: "I subtract 15. New N is 15."

#### Turn 2 - Player 2

- **Current N**: 15
- **Proper Divisors**: 3, 5
- **Player 2 chooses**: 5
- **Calculation**: N = 15 - 5 = 10
- **Announce**: "I subtract 5. New N is 10."

#### Turn 3 - Player 1

- **Current N**: 10
- **Proper Divisors**: 2, 5
- **Player 1 chooses**: 5
- **Calculation**: N = 10 - 5 = 5
- **Announce**: "I subtract 5. New N is 5."

#### Turn 4 - Player 2

- **Current N**: 5
- **Proper Divisors**: None (5 is prime)
- **Player 2 cannot move**.
- **Result**: Player 2 loses.
- **Announce**: "I cannot make a valid move. I lose."

**Player 1 wins!**

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start
Starting Number N = 30

Player 1's Turn
Current N: 30
Proper Divisors of 30 are: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Player 1, enter your chosen proper divisor: 15
You subtract 15 from 30.
New N is 15.

Player 2's Turn
Current N: 15
Proper Divisors of 15 are: 3, 5
Player 2, enter your chosen proper divisor: 5
You subtract 5 from 15.
New N is 10.

Player 1's Turn
Current N: 10
Proper Divisors of 10 are: 2, 5
Player 1, enter your chosen proper divisor: 5
You subtract 5 from 10.
New N is 5.

Player 2's Turn
Current N: 5
No proper divisors available for 5.
Player 2 cannot make a move and loses.
Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategies

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves to avoid leaving N as a prime number on your turn.
- **Control the Number**: Aim to reduce N to numbers with fewer proper divisors when it's your opponent's turn.
- **Avoid Certain Numbers**: Be cautious of numbers that may allow your opponent to force a win, such as small composites with limited divisors.

## Notes

- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; there is always a winner.
- **Skill Advantage**: Strategic planning allows skilled players to consistently outperform less experienced players.
- **Quick Gameplay**: With simple rules and mechanics, games progress rapidly.
