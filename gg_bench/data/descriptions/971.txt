# Digit Deletion Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce your opponent's number to a **single digit** by strategically removing digits from their number.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Starting Numbers**: Each player starts with a unique **three-digit number** composed of digits from 1 to 9 (inclusive). Zero is not used in any position.
  - Players can choose their own starting numbers or have them assigned randomly.
- **Game Start**: Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., through a coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Player Numbers**: Each player maintains their current number, initially a three-digit number (e.g., 123, 987).
- **Digit Positions**:
  - **Left**: The hundreds place.
  - **Middle**: The tens place.
  - **Right**: The ones place.
- **Turn Indicator**: A simple mechanism to keep track of whose turn it is (e.g., a prompt in the command-line interface).

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately throughout the game.
- **During a Turn**:
  1. **Select Digit Position**: The current player chooses one digit position (**left**, **middle**, or **right**) to remove from the opponent's number.
  2. **Update Opponent's Number**: The opponent's number is updated by removing the chosen digit and shifting the remaining digits to form a new number.
  3. **Check for Win**: If the opponent's number is reduced to a single digit, the current player wins.
  4. **Pass Turn**: If the game hasn't ended, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Digit Removal

- **Valid Choices**: On your turn, you must choose one of the digit positions in your opponent's current number:
  - **Left** (hundreds place)
  - **Middle** (tens place)
  - **Right** (ones place)
- **Removal Process**:
  - Remove the selected digit from your opponent's number.
  - Shift the remaining digits to form the new number without changing their order.
    - *Example*: If the number is **456** and you remove the **middle** digit (**5**), the new number becomes **46**.

### 2. Turn Progression

- **Mandatory Move**: You cannot skip your turn; you must remove a digit from the opponent's number if it has more than one digit.
- **Single-Digit Numbers**: If the opponent's number is already a single digit at the start of your turn, you cannot remove any digits.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: If your action reduces the opponent's number to a single digit, you win the game immediately.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player achieves the victory condition.

### 4. Game End

- The game ends when one player's number is reduced to a single digit.
- Declare the winner and optionally reset for another round.

## Scoring

- **Single-Game Win**: The player who reduces their opponent's number to a single digit wins the game.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Keep track of wins over multiple games to determine an overall champion.
  - Assign points or simply count the number of games won.

## Examples

### Example Scenario 1

**Initial Setup**:

- Player 1's number: **732**
- Player 2's number: **865**

**Gameplay**:

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to remove the **middle** digit from Player 2's number (**865**).
   - Player 2's new number: **85** (digits **8** and **5**).
2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses to remove the **right** digit from Player 1's number (**732**).
   - Player 1's new number: **73** (digits **7** and **3**).
3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses to remove the **left** digit from Player 2's number (**85**).
   - Player 2's new number: **5** (single digit).

**Outcome**:

- Player 2's number is now a single digit.
- **Player 1 wins the game**.

### Example Scenario 2 (Command-Line Interaction)

**Game Start**:

- Player 1's number: **549**
- Player 2's number: **876**

**Gameplay**:

- **Turn 1 - Player 1**:
  ```
  Player 1, choose a digit position to remove from Player 2's number (left, middle, right): right
  ```
  - Player 2's number becomes **87**.

- **Turn 2 - Player 2**:
  ```
  Player 2, choose a digit position to remove from Player 1's number (left, middle, right): middle
  ```
  - Player 1's number becomes **59**.

- **Turn 3 - Player 1**:
  ```
  Player 1, choose a digit position to remove from Player 2's number (left, middle, right): left
  ```
  - Player 2's number becomes **7**.

**Outcome**:

- Player 2's number is now a single digit.
- **Player 1 wins the game**.

## Strategic Depth

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Consider how your opponent might respond and plan your digit removals to put them at a disadvantage.
- **Digit Importance**: Sometimes removing a certain digit can leave the opponent with a stronger or weaker number in terms of future options.
- **Defensive Play**: Plan your moves not only to reduce your opponent's number but also to protect your own number from being reduced quickly.

## Conclusion

Digit Deletion Duel is a straightforward yet strategic game perfect for quick matches on a command-line interface. Its simplicity makes it easy to code and play, while the strategic element ensures that skilled players can consistently outperform their opponents.

Enjoy the duel!
