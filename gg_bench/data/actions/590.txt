The action space indices map to game moves as follows: indices 0-4 represent the addition of numbers 1-5 to the current number, and indices 5-9 represent the multiplication of the current number by numbers 1-5, respectively. Thus, each index corresponds to a combination of an operation (either "add" or "multiply") and a specific number within the range 1 to 5.
