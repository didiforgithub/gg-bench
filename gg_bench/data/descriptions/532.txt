# Grid Conquest

**A Strategic Two-Player Command-Line Game**

---

## Objective

*Be the first player to reach or exceed **15 points** by strategically claiming cells on a hidden-value grid.*

---

## Setup

- **Grid Initialization**:
  - The game is played on a **5x5 grid**, with cells labeled from **A1** to **E5**.
  - Each cell is randomly assigned a **hidden value** between **1** and **5**.
  - All cell values are hidden at the start of the game.

- **Player Preparation**:
  - Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
  - Both players start with a **score of 0**.

- **Game Start**:
  - Decide which player goes first (e.g., by a coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **The Grid**:
  - A virtual 5x5 grid with cells labeled:
    ```
    A1 A2 A3 A4 A5
    B1 B2 B3 B4 B5
    C1 C2 C3 C4 C5
    D1 D2 D3 D4 D5
    E1 E2 E3 E4 E5
    ```

- **Cells**:
  - Each cell contains:
    - **Hidden Value**: A random integer between **1** and **5**.
    - **Status**:
      - **Unclaimed**: Not yet selected by any player.
      - **Claimed**: Selected by a player; value revealed and added to their score.

- **Player Scores**:
  - A running total of points accumulated by each player based on claimed cells.

---

## Turns

- Players take turns in sequential order.
- **During a Turn**, a player:
  1. **Selects an Unclaimed Cell**:
     - Must choose a cell that has not been claimed by either player.
     - Can be a hidden cell or a previously revealed cell.
  2. **Claims the Cell**:
     - The cellâ€™s value is revealed.
     - The value is **added to the player's score**.
     - The cell is marked as **claimed** by the player.
  3. **Reveals Adjacent Cells**:
     - All **orthogonally and diagonally adjacent** unclaimed cells become **revealed** (values shown but not claimed).

- **Turn Progression**:
  - After completing these steps, the turn passes to the next player.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Claiming Cells

- **Selecting Cells**:
  - Players may choose any **unclaimed** cell on the grid.
  - Selecting a cell strategically can influence the game's outcome.

- **Hidden and Revealed Cells**:
  - **Hidden Cells**: Values are not visible until selected or revealed.
  - **Revealed Cells**: Values are visible but remain unclaimed until a player chooses to claim them.

### Revealing Adjacent Cells

- When a cell is claimed:
  - All surrounding unclaimed cells (up to 8 cells) are revealed.
  - Revealed cells provide strategic information for future turns.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The first player to reach or exceed **15 points** wins the game **immediately**.

- **End of Game**:
  - If all cells are claimed and no player has reached 15 points:
    - The player with the **higher score** wins.
    - If scores are **tied**, the game enters **sudden death**.

### Sudden Death Rules

- Players continue taking turns claiming one cell at a time.
- The first player to gain a **lead in points** wins.
- If no unclaimed cells remain and the tie persists, the game is declared a **draw** (though initial rules state no draws, sudden death ensures a winner).

---

## Scoring

- **Accumulating Points**:
  - Players gain points equal to the **value of each cell** they claim.
  - Scores are updated immediately after each turn.

- **Tracking Scores**:
  - Scores should be displayed after each turn for both players.

## Strategic Tips

- **Consider Future Reveals**:
  - Claiming a cell not only adds to your score but also reveals adjacent cells that may benefit your opponent.
  
- **Balance Risk and Reward**:
  - High-value revealed cells can boost your score but may expose better options for your opponent.

- **Control High-Value Areas**:
  - Aim to reveal and claim cells around high-value cells to prevent your opponent from accessing them.

- **Monitor Scores**:
  - Keep track of both scores to gauge how aggressive you need to be in claiming higher-value cells.
