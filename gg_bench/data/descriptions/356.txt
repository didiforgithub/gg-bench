# Prime Division Duel

## Objective

**Prime Division Duel** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared "Current Number" to exactly **1** by dividing it by its prime factors. Players achieve victory by strategically choosing prime factors to divide the Current Number on their turn. The player who cannot make a valid move (either because the Current Number is 1 or there are no valid prime factors to divide by) loses the game.

---

## Setup

1. **Choose the Starting Number:**
   - Select an initial integer **N** greater than **1** to be the **Current Number**. This can be a predefined number (e.g., N = 60) or one agreed upon by both players at the start.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide which player will take the first turn. This can be done by mutual agreement or by a random method like a coin toss.

3. **Initialize the Game Environment:**
   - Prepare a command-line interface where players can input their moves and see the Current Number and available prime factors on each turn.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number (N):**
  - An integer greater than **1** that both players will manipulate during the game. It is updated after each turn based on players' actions.

- **Prime Factors:**
  - Prime numbers that are exact divisors of the Current Number. These are the valid options players can choose to divide the Current Number.

- **Players:**
  - Two participants (Player 1 and Player 2) who alternate turns making strategic decisions to reach the game's objective.

- **Command-Line Interface:**
  - The platform where the game is played. It displays the Current Number, available prime factors, and accepts players' inputs.

---

## Turns

1. **Start of Turn:**
   - The game announces which player's turn it is and displays the Current Number.

2. **Determine Prime Factors:**
   - Calculate and display all prime factors of the Current Number (excluding **1**).

3. **Player's Action:**
   - The player selects one of the available prime factors.
   - The chosen prime factor must divide the Current Number exactly (without a remainder).

4. **Update Current Number:**
   - Divide the Current Number by the chosen prime factor using integer division.
   - The result becomes the new Current Number for the next turn.

5. **End of Turn:**
   - Check if the Current Number is **1**:
     - If **yes**, the player who made the last valid move wins the game.
     - If **no**, pass the turn to the other player.

6. **Invalid Moves:**
   - If a player cannot make a valid move (no valid prime factors), they lose the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules:

1. **Valid Prime Factors:**
   - Only prime numbers that are exact divisors of the Current Number can be used.
   - **1** is not considered a prime factor and cannot be used.

2. **Division Process:**
   - Players must perform exact division; the Current Number divided by the chosen prime factor must result in an integer without any remainder.

3. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players cannot skip their turn. If there is a valid move, they must make one.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins by reducing the Current Number to exactly **1** on their turn.
   - If a player cannot make a move because the Current Number is **1**, they lose.

5. **Losing the Game:**
   - A player loses if they cannot perform a valid division because there are no prime factors (other than **1**) for the Current Number.

### Strategic Mechanics:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Players should anticipate future moves and consider how their choice of prime factor will affect subsequent turns.

- **Prime Factor Selection:**
  - Choosing larger prime factors can reduce the Current Number more significantly but may open opportunities for the opponent.

- **Endgame Strategy:**
  - Players must be cautious when the Current Number becomes small to avoid setting up an unavoidable loss.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game:**
  - The player who reduces the Current Number to **1** wins the game outright.

- **No Point System:**
  - There is no cumulative scoring or points; victory is determined solely by achieving the game's objective.

## Examples

### Example Game Starting with N = 60

#### Initial Setup:

- **Current Number:** 60
- **Player 1** will start.

---

#### Gameplay:

1. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 60
   - **Prime Factors of 60:** [2, 3, 5]
   - **Player 1 chooses:** 5
   - **Calculation:** 60 รท 5 = 12
   - **New Current Number:** 12

2. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 12
   - **Prime Factors of 12:** [2, 3]
   - **Player 2 chooses:** 3
   - **Calculation:** 12 รท 3 = 4
   - **New Current Number:** 4

3. **Player 1's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 4
   - **Prime Factors of 4:** [2]
   - **Player 1 chooses:** 2
   - **Calculation:** 4 รท 2 = 2
   - **New Current Number:** 2

4. **Player 2's Turn:**

   - **Current Number:** 2
   - **Prime Factors of 2:** [2]
   - **Player 2 chooses:** 2
   - **Calculation:** 2 รท 2 = 1
   - **New Current Number:** 1

---

#### Outcome:

- **Player 2** has reduced the **Current Number** to 1 and **wins** the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Game Start: Current Number = 60

Player 1's turn. Current Number: 60
Prime factors of 60: [2, 3, 5]
Enter a prime factor to divide by: 5
You chose 5.
New Current Number: 12

Player 2's turn. Current Number: 12
Prime factors of 12: [2, 3]
Enter a prime factor to divide by: 3
You chose 3.
New Current Number: 4

Player 1's turn. Current Number: 4
Prime factors of 4: [2]
Enter a prime factor to divide by: 2
You chose 2.
New Current Number: 2

Player 2's turn. Current Number: 2
Prime factors of 2: [2]
Enter a prime factor to divide by: 2
You chose 2.
New Current Number: 1

Player 2 has reduced the Current Number to 1 and wins the game!
```

## Additional Notes

### Strategic Tips:

- **Think Ahead:**
  - Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the Current Number after your turn.

- **Prime Factor Selection:**
  - Sometimes selecting a smaller prime factor can be advantageous by limiting your opponent's options.

- **Avoiding Traps:**
  - Be cautious of reducing the Current Number to a point where your opponent can force a win.

### Complexity and Depth:

- Despite simple rules, the game offers strategic depth as players must consider arithmetic and the implications of each move.

### Variations:

- **Different Starting Numbers:**
  - Use larger or smaller starting numbers to adjust game length and complexity.

- **Restricted Prime Factors:**
  - Introduce rules where certain primes cannot be used to add complexity.

- **Multiple Rounds:**
  - Play multiple rounds with different starting numbers, tallying wins to determine an overall champion.
