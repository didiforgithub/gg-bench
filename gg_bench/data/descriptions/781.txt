# Bit Flip

## Objective

**Bit Flip** is a two-player, turn-based strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reduce a shared binary number to zero by flipping bits according to the game rules. The player who changes the binary number to all zeros on their turn wins the game.

## Setup

1. **Initial Binary Number**: Agree on the length of the binary number (number of bits) to be used in the game. A recommended starting length is **8 bits** for a quick game, but any reasonable length (e.g., 5 to 16 bits) can be used.
2. **Starting Configuration**: Initialize the binary number to all ones. For example, with 8 bits, the starting number is **11111111**.
3. **Player Assignment**: Decide which player will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. This can be done randomly or by mutual agreement.
4. **First Turn**: Player 1 begins the game.

## Game Components

- **Binary Number**: A sequence of bits represented as ones (`1`) and zeros (`0`). It is shared between both players and displayed during each turn.
- **Bit Positions**: Each bit in the binary number has a position index, starting from **1** on the leftmost bit to **N** on the rightmost bit, where **N** is the length of the binary number.
- **Players**: Two participants designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## Turns

- The game proceeds in alternating turns, starting with Player 1.
- During a turn, the active player performs one valid action to modify the shared binary number.
- After the action, the updated binary number is displayed.
- The turn then passes to the other player.
- The game continues until one player wins according to the winning condition.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Actions on a Turn

On their turn, a player must perform one of the following actions:

1. **Flip a Single Bit**:
   - Choose any one bit that is currently set to `1`.
   - Flip it to `0`.

2. **Flip Two Adjacent Bits**:
   - Choose two bits that are both currently set to `1` and are next to each other (adjacent).
   - Flip both bits to `0`.

### Restrictions

- **Valid Moves**:
  - A player can only flip bits that are currently set to `1`.
  - When flipping two bits, they must be adjacent and both set to `1`.
- **Mandatory Action**:
  - A player must make a valid move on their turn. Skipping a turn or passing is not allowed.
- **No Reversing**:
  - Bits set to `0` cannot be changed back to `1`.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - The player who reduces the binary number to all zeros (`0`) on their turn immediately wins the game.
- **No Valid Moves**:
  - If a player has no valid moves on their turn (because all bits are `0`), they lose the game.

## Scoring

- **Win/Loss Outcome**:
  - The game is won by the player who successfully reduces the binary number to zero on their turn.
  - There is no point system or scoring beyond determining the winner of each game.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting Binary Number**: `11111` (5 bits)

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Flip a single bit at position **3**.
- **Explanation**: Bit at position 3 (counting from the left) is flipped from `1` to `0`.
- **Updated Binary Number**: `1 1 0 1 1`

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Action**: Flip two adjacent bits starting at position **4**.
- **Explanation**: Bits at positions 4 and 5 are both `1` and adjacent. Both are flipped to `0`.
- **Updated Binary Number**: `1 1 0 0 0`

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Action**: Flip two adjacent bits starting at position **1**.
- **Explanation**: Bits at positions 1 and 2 are both `1` and adjacent. Both are flipped to `0`.
- **Updated Binary Number**: `0 0 0 0 0`

**Result**: Player 1 wins by reducing the binary number to all zeros.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

Player 1's Turn
Current Binary Number: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

Choose your action:
1) Flip a single bit
2) Flip two adjacent bits
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1

Enter the position of the bit to flip (1-8): 4

You flipped bit at position 4.

Updated Binary Number: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Player 1 has reduced the binary number to zero and wins the game!
```

**Explanation**:

- Players take turns strategically flipping bits to force the opponent into a position with no winning moves.
- Optimal play involves anticipating the opponent's responses and planning several moves ahead.
