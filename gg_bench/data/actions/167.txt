In the provided gym environment for Sequence Duel, the action space is a discrete space with 9 possible actions, represented by indices 0 through 8. Each index corresponds directly to selecting a number from the available numbers in the game pool, which are the numbers 1 to 9. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, index 1 to selecting number 2, and so forth up to index 8, which corresponds to selecting the number 9. Thus, a player's move in the game is determined by choosing an action index that maps to the respective number they wish to pick from the pool during their turn.
