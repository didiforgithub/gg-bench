The action space indices in the game are mapped directly to the player's choices regarding the drawn card:

- Action 0: The player chooses to keep the current card, adding its value to their cumulative score.
- Action 1: The player opts to discard the first drawn card, which allows them to draw a second card that must be kept if possible.
