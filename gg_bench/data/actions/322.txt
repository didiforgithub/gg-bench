The action space indices in the CustomEnv gym environment map directly to the numbers in the game. Specifically, each index from 0 to 19 in the action space corresponds to numbers 1 to 20 in the game. Therefore, an action of index 0 selects the number 1, an action of index 1 selects the number 2, and so on, with an action of index 19 selecting the number 20.
