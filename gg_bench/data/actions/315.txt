In the `CustomEnv` environment for **Binary Clash**, the `action_space` is defined as a discrete space with size `N`, where `N` is the length of the binary number. Each index in the `action_space` corresponds directly to a bit position in the shared binary number, ranging from `0` to `N-1`. A player's action is choosing an index in this space, which represents flipping the corresponding bit from `0` to `1` in the shared binary number.
