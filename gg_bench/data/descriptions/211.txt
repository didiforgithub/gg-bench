# Star Capture

## Objective

The objective of **Star Capture** is to be the first player to collect **three (3) stars** on a 5x5 grid. Players navigate the grid, capturing stars and strategically moving to outmaneuver their opponent. The game ends when a player successfully captures their third star, thus achieving victory.

## Setup

1. **Grid Initialization**: Create a 5x5 grid represented by coordinates `(0,0)` to `(4,4)`.
2. **Star Placement**: Randomly place **seven (7)** stars on the grid. Stars cannot be placed on the players' starting positions.
3. **Player Positions**:
   - **Player 1** starts at the top-left corner `(0,0)`.
   - **Player 2** starts at the bottom-right corner `(4,4)`.
4. **Starting Conditions**:
   - Both players begin with zero stars captured.
   - The positions of the stars and players are known to both players.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 matrix representing the game space.
- **Stars (`*`)**: Collectible items placed randomly on the grid cells except for the starting positions.
- **Players**:
  - **Player 1 (`P1`)**: Represented by their coordinates on the grid.
  - **Player 2 (`P2`)**: Represented similarly to Player 1.
- **Empty Cell**: A grid space that does not contain a star or a player.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.
- **Actions Per Turn**:
  - **Move**: A player must move to one of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right). Diagonal movements are not allowed.
    - Movement should keep the player within the bounds of the grid.
  - **Capture**:
    - If a player moves onto a cell containing a star, they capture the star, and the star is removed from the grid.
    - If a player moves onto a cell occupied by the opponent, they **steal one captured star** from the opponent (if the opponent has any stars).
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After completing their move (and any resultant action), the turn passes to the other player.
  - Players cannot skip or pass their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement**:
   - Players must move each turn; staying in the same cell is not permitted.
   - Players cannot move off the grid.
2. **Capturing Stars**:
   - Collecting a star increases the player's star count by one.
   - The star is removed from the grid upon capture.
3. **Stealing Stars**:
   - Landing on the opponent's current position allows the player to steal one star from them.
   - If the opponent has no stars, no stars are stolen.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to have **three (3)** stars in their possession wins the game immediately.
5. **No Draws**:
   - The game continues until one player wins. There are no draw conditions.
6. **Star Availability**:
   - Once all stars on the grid are captured, players can only increase their star count by stealing from the opponent.

## Scoring

- **Star Count**:
  - Players keep track of the number of stars they have captured.
  - The score is simply the number of stars each player currently holds.
- **Victory Condition**:
  - A player wins upon capturing their third star.

## Additional Notes

- **Strategic Depth**:
  - Players must decide whether to pursue stars, block the opponent, or attempt to steal stars.
  - Awareness of the opponent's position and potential moves is crucial.
- **Game Balance**:
  - Random star placement ensures that each game is unique and requires adaptable strategies.
  - Starting positions are equidistant from most stars to provide a fair chance for both players.
  
Enjoy your game of **Star Capture**, and may the most strategic player win!
