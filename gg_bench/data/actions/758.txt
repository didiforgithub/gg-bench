The action space in the environment is defined as `spaces.Discrete(9)`, representing possible actions corresponding to playing number cards with values from 1 to 9. The indices in the action space (0 through 8) map directly to card values by adding 1 to the index. Therefore, action index 0 corresponds to playing card 1, action index 1 corresponds to playing card 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which corresponds to playing card 9.
