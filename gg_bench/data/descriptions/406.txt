# Grid Runner

## Objective

Be the first player to reach your opponent's baseline or capture their token. Strategically navigate your token across a 5x5 grid to outmaneuver your opponent. Victory is achieved by either:

- Moving your token to any square on your opponent's baseline.
- Capturing your opponent's token by landing on their square.

## Setup

1. **Grid Creation**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid, with rows and columns numbered from 0 to 4.

2. **Starting Positions**:
   - **Player 1**:
     - Token starts at position **(0, 2)** (the center square of the top row).
   - **Player 2**:
     - Token starts at position **(4, 2)** (the center square of the bottom row).

3. **Baselines**:
   - **Player 1's Baseline**: Row 0 (top row).
   - **Player 2's Baseline**: Row 4 (bottom row).

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 matrix representing the game board.
- **Tokens**: Each player has one token, which can be represented by unique symbols or colors in the command-line interface (e.g., "P1" for Player 1 and "P2" for Player 2).
- **Positions**: Tokens occupy grid coordinates denoted as **(row, column)**.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, with Player 1 starting the game.
- **Actions per Turn**:
  - A player moves their token according to the movement rules.
- **Turn Progression**:
  1. **Display Grid**: The current state of the grid is shown.
  2. **Player's Move**: The active player inputs their move.
  3. **Update Grid**: The grid updates to reflect the move.
  4. **Check for Win Conditions**: Determine if the game has been won.
  5. **Next Player's Turn**: If the game continues, the next player takes their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Directions**:
  - **Forward**: Toward the opponent's baseline.
    - Player 1 moves toward higher row numbers.
    - Player 2 moves toward lower row numbers.
  - **Lateral**: Left or right within the same row.
  - **Diagonal Forward**: Combines forward and lateral movement.
- **Allowed Moves**:
  - **Move Forward**: Advance one square toward the opponent's baseline.
  - **Move Left**: Move one square to the left (decreasing column number).
  - **Move Right**: Move one square to the right (increasing column number).
  - **Move Diagonally Forward Left**: Move one square diagonally forward and left.
  - **Move Diagonally Forward Right**: Move one square diagonally forward and right.
- **Restrictions**:
  - **No Backward Moves**: Moving toward your own baseline is not allowed.
  - **Stay Within Bounds**: Tokens cannot move off the grid.
  - **Single Square Movement**: Only one square per turn.

### Capturing

- **Landing on Opponent's Token**:
  - If a player moves their token onto the square occupied by the opponent's token, they capture it and win the game.

### Winning the Game

- **Reaching Opponent's Baseline**:
  - A player wins by moving their token onto any square of the opponent's baseline.
- **Capturing Opponent's Token**:
  - A player wins by capturing the opponent's token as described above.
- **Simultaneous Baseline Reach**:
  - If both players reach each other's baseline on the same turn, the player who moved first (Player 1) wins.

## Scoring

- **No Point System**: The game is a win/lose scenario without point tracking.
- **Match Play** (Optional):
  - Players may agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion after a set number of games.

  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][P2][ ][ ]
  ```

**Turn 4**:
- **Player 2**:
  - **Possible Moves**:
    - Forward to (2, 2) â€” Occupied by Player 1
    - Diagonal Forward Left to (2, 1)
    - Diagonal Forward Right to (2, 3)
  - **Chooses**: Move Forward to **(2, 2)** to capture
- **Result**:
  - Player 2 lands on **(2, 2)**, captures Player 1's token, and wins the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Player 1's Turn**:
```
Current Grid:
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][P1][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][P2][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Player 1, enter your move (format: row,column):
> 2,2

Move accepted. Player 1 moved to (2,2).
```

**Player 2's Turn**:
```
Current Grid:
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][P1][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][P2][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

Player 2, enter your move (format: row,column):
> 2,2

Move accepted. Player 2 moved to (2,2).

Player 2 has captured Player 1's token and wins the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Predict Opponent's Moves**: Anticipate where your opponent might move and position yourself to block or capture.
- **Control the Center**: Holding central positions can give you more movement options.
- **Balance Offense and Defense**: While advancing toward the baseline, be wary of exposing yourself to capture.

## Additional Rules (Optional Variations)

- **Blocked Squares**:
  - Players may agree to designate certain squares as blocked, adding complexity to movement options.
- **Teleport Squares**:
  - Introducing squares that allow tokens to teleport to another part of the grid.
- **Multiple Tokens**:
  - Each player controls multiple tokens, with victory conditions adjusted accordingly.
