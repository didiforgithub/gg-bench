# Parity Duel Rule Book

## Objective

**Parity Duel** is a two-player turn-based game where players strategically select numbers based on parity rules. The primary goal is to be the last player able to make a valid move. You achieve victory by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot select a number that meets the game's parity requirements on their turn.

---

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: The game uses a shared pool of numbers from **1 to 20**.
- **Initial State**: All numbers are initially available and unselected.
- **Starting Player**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., flip a coin or mutual agreement).

---

## Game Components

1. **Number Pool**:
   - A list of numbers from 1 to 20.
   - Numbers are removed from the pool as they are selected.

2. **Parity Tracker**:
   - Keeps track of the required parity (**even** or **odd**) for each turn.
   - Based on the parity of the number selected in the previous turn.

3. **Players**:
   - **Player 1** and **Player 2** alternate turns.
   - Each player makes selections from the shared number pool.

## Turns

### Structure of a Turn

1. **Player's Selection**:
   - On their turn, a player selects an unused number from the pool that matches the required parity.

2. **Update Game State**:
   - Remove the selected number from the number pool.
   - Update the parity tracker for the next turn.

3. **Announce Move**:
   - The player announces their selected number and its parity.
   - Indicate the required parity for the next player.

### Order of Actions

1. **First Turn**:
   - Player 1 selects any number from 1 to 20 without parity restrictions.

2. **Subsequent Turns**:
   - Players alternate turns following the parity rules.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Numbers**:
   - Players choose from the remaining unselected numbers in the number pool.

2. **Parity Rules**:
   - The required parity for a player's selection depends on the parity of the number chosen in the previous turn:
     - **If the previous number was _even_**, the next player must select an **_odd_** number.
     - **If the previous number was _odd_**, the next player must select an **_even_** number.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - A move is valid if:
     - The number selected matches the required parity.
     - The number has not been previously selected.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player selects a number that does not match the required parity or has already been selected, it is an invalid move. The player must choose a valid number.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn due to the lack of available numbers matching the required parity.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game continues until one player wins. There is no mechanism for a draw.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The player who forces their opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move wins the game.
- **No Points System**: The game does not use a points system; it is a win/loss game.
- **Game End**: The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Keep track of the remaining numbers to anticipate future parity requirements.
- **Limit Opponent's Options**: Try to select numbers that will force your opponent into a position with fewer valid moves.
- **Balance Number Selection**: Avoid using all of one parity too quickly, as it may backfire if the other player manipulates the parity to their advantage.
