# **Prime Seize**: A Strategic Number Elimination Game

---

## **Objective**

Be the player to make the last valid move by strategically selecting prime numbers from a shared list and eliminating options for your opponent.

---

## **Setup**

1. **Number Range**

   - The game begins with a sequential list of integers starting from **2** up to a predetermined maximum number **N** (e.g., N = 50).
   - Example Starting List: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 50]`

2. **Display the List**

   - The list of available numbers is displayed to both players in the command-line interface.

3. **Player Assignment**

   - Decide which player will take the first turn (**Player 1** and **Player 2**).
   - This can be determined by mutual agreement or randomly (e.g., coin toss).

---

## **Game Components**

1. **Number List**

   - A shared, dynamic list of integers from **2** to **N**.
   - The list is updated after each turn based on the selections made.

2. **Players**

   - **Player 1** and **Player 2**, who alternate turns throughout the game.

3. **Command-Line Interface**

   - The game is played via a command-line interface where the list of numbers and prompts are displayed.

4. **Prime Selection Mechanism**

   - A function or process to verify if a chosen number is prime.
   - Mechanism to remove the selected prime and its multiples from the list.

---

## **Turns**

### **Turn Order**

- Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.

### **Turn Actions**

On each turn, a player must perform the following steps:

1. **Select a Number**

   - Choose a number from the current list of available numbers.

2. **Validity Check**

   - Ensure the selected number is **prime**.

3. **Eliminate Multiples**

   - Remove the selected prime number and all of its multiples from the list.

4. **Update the List**

   - Display the updated list of available numbers to both players.

---

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**

   - Only prime numbers that are present in the current list can be selected.
   - A move is valid if it satisfies both conditions:
     - The number is **prime**.
     - The number is **available** in the list.

2. **Elimination of Numbers**

   - Upon selecting a prime number, the following numbers are removed from the list:
     - The selected prime number itself.
     - All multiples of the selected prime number.

3. **Unavailable Choices**

   - Non-prime numbers or numbers not in the list cannot be selected.
   - Attempting to select such numbers results in an invalid move.

4. **End of Game Condition**

   - If a player cannot select a valid prime number on their turn because no primes remain in the list, they **lose** the game.
   - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

5. **Invalid Moves**

   - If a player selects an invalid number:
     - The move is declared invalid.
     - The player **immediately loses** the game.
     - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

6. **Time Limits (Optional)**

   - A time limit per turn (e.g., 30 seconds) may be enforced to keep the game progressing quickly.
   - Exceeding the time limit results in an automatic loss.

---

## **Scoring**

- The game does not involve point accumulation.
- Winning is based solely on being the player to make the last valid move.
- The winner is the player who successfully forces their opponent into a position where no valid moves remain.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game Playthrough**

**Starting List:**  
`[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 50]`

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Selection:** `2`
- **Reasoning:** `2` is the smallest prime number.
- **Action:** Remove `2` and all multiples of `2` from the list.
- **Numbers Eliminated:** `2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 50`
- **Updated List:**  
  `[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, ..., 49]`

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Selection:** `3`
- **Reasoning:** `3` is the next smallest available prime.
- **Action:** Remove `3` and all multiples of `3` from the list.
- **Numbers Eliminated:** `3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45`
- **Updated List:**  
  `[5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49]`

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Selection:** `5`
- **Reasoning:** `5` is the next available prime.
- **Action:** Remove `5` and all multiples of `5` from the list.
- **Numbers Eliminated:** `5, 25, 35, 45`
- **Updated List:**  
  `[7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49]`

---

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Selection:** `7`
- **Reasoning:** `7` is the next available prime.
- **Action:** Remove `7` and all multiples of `7` from the list.

- **Updated List:**  
  `[11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]`

---

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Selection:** `11`
- **Action:** Remove `11` (multiples beyond 50 are not in the list).

*The game continues in this fashion until no valid moves remain for the player whose turn it is.*

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

**Turn 1: Player 1**

```
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, ..., 50]
Player 1, select a prime number: 2
You have selected 2.
2 and its multiples are removed.
Updated Numbers: [3, 5, 7, ..., 49]
```

---

**Turn 2: Player 2**

```
Available Numbers: [3, 5, 7, ..., 49]
Player 2, select a prime number: 3
You have selected 3.
3 and its multiples are removed.

```

---

**Turn 3: Player 1**

```
Available Numbers: [5, 7, 11, ..., 49]
Player 1, select a prime number: 5
You have selected 5.
5 and its multiples are removed.
Updated Numbers: [7, 11, 13, ..., 47]
```

## **Strategic Considerations**

1. **Prime Number Knowledge**

   - Familiarity with prime numbers up to **N** is advantageous.
   - This knowledge helps in quickly identifying valid moves.

2. **Anticipate Opponent's Options**

   - Consider which primes will remain after your move.
   - Aim to limit the available primes for your opponent.

3. **Forcing Moves**

   - Plan moves that force your opponent into a position with no valid primes.
   - Controlling the flow of the game increases your chances of winning.

4. **Avoid Invalid Moves**

   - Double-check your selections to ensure they are both prime and available.
   - An invalid move results in an immediate loss.

5. **Time Management**

   - If a time limit is enforced, manage your time wisely.
   - Quick decision-making can put pressure on your opponent.

---

## **Game End and Winning**

- The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- The last player to make a valid move is declared the **winner**.
- The losing player is the one who:
  - Has no valid primes to select on their turn.
  - Makes an invalid move (selects a non-prime or unavailable number).
  - Exceeds the time limit per turn (if applicable).

---

## **Summary**

"Prime Seize" is a strategic two-player game that combines basic arithmetic with tactical foresight. By selecting prime numbers and eliminating options, players engage in a battle of wits to outmaneuver their opponent. The simplicity of the rules makes it easy to learn and code, while the depth of strategy ensures replayability and competitive gameplay.
