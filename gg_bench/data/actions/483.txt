In the "Pattern Builder" game gym environment, the action space consists of integers from 0 to 8, each representing selecting a unique number from 1 to 9. The mapping is as follows: action index 0 corresponds to selecting number 1, action index 1 to number 2, action index 2 to number 3, and so on, up to action index 8 for number 9. This mapping directly ties the action index to the selection of the respective number from the pool.
