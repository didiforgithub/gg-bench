In the game environment, the action space consists of integers from 0 to 7, which correspond to the valid divisors 2 to 9. Specifically, each action index is mapped to a divisor by adding 2 to the index value. Thus, action index 0 maps to divisor 2, action index 1 maps to divisor 3, and so on, up to action index 7 mapping to divisor 9.
