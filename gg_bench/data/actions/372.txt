In this game, the action space indices (0-8) correspond directly to the digits (1-9) that a player can use for attacking or defending. Each index in the action space maps to a specific digit by simply adding 1 to the index: index 0 maps to digit 1, index 1 maps to digit 2, and so on, up to index 8 mapping to digit 9. This mapping allows players to select their desired digit for each turn within the framework of the action space.
