The action space in the environment is represented as a discrete space with 25 possible actions, corresponding to each cell in the 5x5 grid. The action indices range from 0 to 24, with each index representing a unique cell on the grid. This mapping is done through a zero-based row-major order: index 0 refers to the cell at (0,0), index 1 to (0,1), ..., index 4 to (0,4), index 5 to (1,0), and so on, up to index 24 which represents cell (4,4). To convert an action index to a grid position, the index is divided by 5 to get the row and taken modulo 5 to get the column.
