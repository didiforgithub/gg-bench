# **Factor Duel**

## **Objective**

Factor Duel is a two-player, turn-based mathematical strategy game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Specifically, a player wins by reducing the shared number to a prime number at the start of their opponent's turn, leaving them with no valid factors to choose from.

## **Setup**

- **Starting Number (N):** The game begins with a shared positive integer greater than 2. The recommended starting number is **30**, but players can agree on any suitable number.
- Both players are aware of the starting number and understand that they will be manipulating this number throughout the game.

## **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N):** A positive integer that both players will manipulate by selecting factors.
- **Factors:** Divisors of the current number N (excluding 1 and N) that players can choose on their turn.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Players input their chosen factors through the command line.

## **Turns**

1. **Turn Order:**
   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., by mutual agreement or a random method).
   - Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.

2. **Player's Turn Structure:**
   - **Display Current Number:** The current value of N is displayed.
   - **Available Factors:** The game lists all valid factors of N (excluding 1 and N itself).
   - **Player Action:** The active player selects one of the available factors.
   - **Update N:** N is divided by the chosen factor, and the result becomes the new N.
   - **End Turn:** Control passes to the other player.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - On your turn, you must select a factor of the current N that is neither 1 nor N itself.
   - The factor must divide evenly into N (no remainders).

2. **Division Process:**
   - After selecting a valid factor, divide N by that factor.
   - The result becomes the new N for the next player's turn.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - **Victory by Prime:** If after your turn N becomes a prime number greater than 1, you win the game. This is because your opponent will have no valid factors to choose from on their turn.
   - **Victory by No Valid Moves:** If your opponent has no valid moves on their turn because N is prime, you win.
   - **Invalid Move Penalty:** If a player selects an invalid factor (not a factor of N, or 1 or N itself), they immediately lose the game.

4. **Game End:**
   - The game ends when one player wins according to the winning conditions.
   - There are no draws in Factor Duel.

## **Scoring**

- **Winning the Game:** The player who forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves wins the game.
- **No Point System:** There is no point tracking; the outcome is simply a win or loss based on the game's objective.

## **Examples**

### **Example Game Play Starting with N = 30**

**Starting N:** 30

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 30
- **Available Factors:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 1 selects factor:** **5**
- **Calculation:** 30 รท 5 = **6**
- **N is now 6**

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 6
- **Available Factors:** 2, 3
- **Player 2 selects factor:** **2**
- **Calculation:** 6 รท 2 = **3**
- **N is now 3**

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 3
- **Available Factors:** None (since 3 is prime)
- **Player 1 has no valid moves and loses.**

**Result:** Player 2 wins the game.

### **Alternative Strategy**

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 30
- **Available Factors:** 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Player 1 selects factor:** **2**
- **Calculation:** 30 รท 2 = **15**
- **N is now 15**

---

**Player 2's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 15
- **Available Factors:** 3, 5
- **Player 2 selects factor:** **5**
- **Calculation:** 15 รท 5 = **3**
- **N is now 3**

---

**Player 1's Turn:**

- **Current N:** 3
- **Available Factors:** None
- **Player 1 has no valid moves and loses.**

**Result:** Player 2 wins the game.

## **Sample Command-Line Interaction**

```
Welcome to Factor Duel!
Starting number (N) is 30.

Player 1's turn.
Current N: 30
Available factors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter your chosen factor: 5
You selected 5.
N is now 6.

Player 2's turn.
Current N: 6
Available factors: 2, 3
Enter your chosen factor: 2
You selected 2.
N is now 3.

Player 1's turn.
Current N: 3
No valid factors available. 3 is a prime number.
Player 1 has no valid moves.
Congratulations, Player 2! You win the game!
```

## **Strategy Tips**

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate your opponent's possible moves based on the factors available after your turn.
- **Control the Game:** Aim to leave N as a composite number with limited factors on your opponent's turn.
- **Avoid Primes on Your Turn:** Ensure that you do not reduce N to a prime number on your own turn unless it's a strategic move to win.
- **Force Prime on Opponent's Turn:** Position the game so that N becomes a prime at the start of your opponent's turn, leaving them without valid moves.

## **Conclusion**

Factor Duel combines simple arithmetic with strategic planning, offering players a quick and engaging experience. Its easy-to-understand rules and minimal components make it ideal for a command-line interface implementation. The game encourages players to think ahead and apply basic number theory to outmaneuver their opponent.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
