# Digit Removal Duel

## Objective

Be the **player who forces your opponent to remove the last digit(s)** of a shared number, thereby winning the game. The goal is to strategically reduce the number to compel your opponent to make the final move that empties the number.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a large positive integer. For a standard game, the starting number is:

  ```
  987654321
  ```

- **Player Roles**: Two players participate, taking turns. Determine randomly or by agreement who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer displayed on the command-line interface, accessible and visible to both players. This number changes as players remove digits.

- **No Physical Pieces**: The game requires no physical componentsâ€”players interact solely through digit removal commands.

---

## Turns

- **Alternating Turns**: Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display Current Number**: The game shows the current value of **N**.
  2. **Player Decision**: The active player chooses how many digits to remove and from which end.
  3. **Update Number**: The game updates **N** based on the player's move.
  4. **Check for Game End**: If **N** is empty, the game ends.

- **No Skipping**: Players must make a valid move on their turn; passing is not allowed.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Digit Removal

- **Removal Options**:
  - **Start of N**: Remove one or more consecutive digits from the beginning of **N**.
  - **End of N**: Remove one or more consecutive digits from the end of **N**.

- **Consecutive Digits**: The digits removed must be consecutive and from one end only; you cannot skip or remove digits from the middle.

- **Minimum Removal**: At least one digit must be removed on each turn.

### 2. Updating N

- **New N**: After removal, the remaining digits form the new **N** for the next player's turn.
  
- **Examples**:
  - If **N** is `987654321` and you remove `"9876"` from the start, the new **N** is `54321`.
  - If **N** is `54321` and you remove `"21"` from the end, the new **N** is `543`.

### 3. Winning the Game

- **Objective**: Force your opponent to remove the last digit(s), leaving **N** empty.
  
- **Victory Condition**:
  - If a player's move results in **N** becoming empty (no digits remaining), that player **loses** the game.
  - The opposing player is then declared the **winner**.

- **No Draws**: The game always results in a win or loss; there are no tie scenarios.

## Scoring

- **No Points System**: The game does not track points.
  
- **Win/Loss Outcome**:
  - The player who avoids removing the last digit(s) **wins**.
  - The player who removes the last digit(s) **loses**.
