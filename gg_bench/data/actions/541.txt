In the `CustomEnv` gym environment, the action space is defined as a `Discrete` space with a range from 0 to `starting_number` + 1. However, the valid actions within this space correspond only to the indices that match the factors of the current number (excluding 1 and the number itself). Each action index, when chosen, represents a factor by which the current number is divided during a player's turn. Thus, to make a valid move, a player selects an action where the index matches a true factor of the current number, as determined by the `get_factors` method.
