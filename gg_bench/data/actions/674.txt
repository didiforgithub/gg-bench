In the gym environment for the Number Line Duel game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(5)`, meaning there are five possible actions indexed from `0` to `4`. These indices map to the possible moves a player can make on their turn, corresponding to moving `1` to `5` positions forward on the number line:

- Action `0` corresponds to moving `1` position.
- Action `1` corresponds to moving `2` positions.
- Action `2` corresponds to moving `3` positions.
- Action `3` corresponds to moving `4` positions.
- Action `4` corresponds to moving `5` positions.

Thus, each action index is mapped to a move length by adding `1` to the index.
