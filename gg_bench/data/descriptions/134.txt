# Rule Book for "Pathfinder Pursuit"

## Objective

**Pathfinder Pursuit** is a two-player turn-based strategy game where players race to discover and traverse a hidden path on a 5x5 grid. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach the **End Point** by correctly following the hidden path from the **Start Point**. Players must use logical deduction and memory to uncover the correct sequence of moves while strategically outmaneuvering their opponent.

---

## Setup

### Game Board

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid with positions labeled from `(1,1)` [top-left corner] to `(5,5)` [bottom-right corner].
- **Start Point**: The starting position for both players at `(1,1)`.
- **End Point**: The final destination at `(5,5)` that players aim to reach.
- **Hidden Path**: A secret sequence of connected cells from the **Start Point** to the **End Point**. This path is randomly generated but follows specific rules:
  - The path consists of adjacent moves (including diagonals).
  - The path does not revisit any cell.
  - Only one unique path exists per game.

### Players

- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token representing their current position on the grid.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method (e.g., a coin toss).

---

## Game Components

### Grid

- A visual or conceptual representation of a 5x5 grid.
- Each cell is identified by its coordinates `(row, column)`.

### Hidden Path

- Known only to the game system (or a neutral party if playing manually).
- Determines valid moves for players.

### Player Tokens

- Represent the current position of each player.
- Start at `(1,1)`.

### Feedback Mechanism

- Provides players with immediate feedback on the validity of their moves:
  - **"Correct"**: Move is on the hidden path.
  - **"Incorrect"**: Move is not on the hidden path; player returns to previous position.

---

## Turns

### Turn Structure

- Players take turns in alternating order.
- Each turn consists of:
  1. **Movement Phase**: The player attempts to move to an adjacent cell.
  2. **Feedback Phase**: The player receives feedback on their move.

### Movement Phase

- A player may move to any **adjacent** cell, including diagonals, resulting in up to 8 possible moves from any cell.
- Players input the coordinates `(row, column)` of the cell they wish to move to.
- Example of valid moves from `(2,2)`:
  - `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`
  - `(2,1)`,        `(2,3)`
  - `(3,1)`, `(3,2)`, `(3,3)`

### Feedback Phase

- After the move, immediate feedback is provided:
  - **"Correct" Move**:
    - The player's token remains on the new cell.
    - The turn ends.
  - **"Incorrect" Move**:
    - The player’s token returns to their previous cell.
    - The turn ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

1. **Adjacency**: Moves must be to an adjacent cell (including diagonally).
2. **Grid Boundaries**: Players cannot move off the grid.
3. **Occupied Cells**:
   - Players cannot move into a cell currently occupied by the opponent, except for the **Start Point**.
   - Both players can be on the **Start Point** simultaneously.

### Feedback Rules

- The feedback only indicates whether the move is part of the hidden path.
- No additional hints are provided.
- Feedback must be accurate and immediate.

### Winning the Game

- The first player to reach the **End Point** at `(5,5)` by following the correct sequence of moves wins the game.
- If both players reach the **End Point** on the same turn, the player who moved first wins.

### Memory and Deduction

- Players must remember their own moves and the feedback received.
- Observing the opponent's moves and feedback can provide valuable clues.
- Note-taking is not allowed unless both players agree before the game begins.

### Restrictions

- **Invalid Moves**:
  - If a player attempts an invalid move (e.g., non-adjacent cell), they are informed, and the turn is forfeited.
- **Skipping Turns**: Players cannot skip their turn.
- **Communication**: Players cannot share information about the hidden path with each other.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- The game concludes when a player reaches the **End Point**.
- The winner is the first to successfully navigate the hidden path to `(5,5)`.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

#### Initial Setup

- Both players start at `(1,1)`.

#### Turn 1

- **Player 1's Move**:
  - Moves to `(1,2)`.
  - **Feedback**: "Correct"
  - **Player 1** is now at `(1,2)`.

- **Player 2's Move**:
  - Attempts to move to `(2,1)`.
  - **Feedback**: "Incorrect"
  - **Player 2** remains at `(1,1)`.

#### Turn 2

- **Player 1's Move**:
  - Moves to `(2,3)`.
  - **Feedback**: "Incorrect"
  - Returns to `(1,2)`.

- **Player 2's Move**:
  - Moves to `(1,2)` (cannot occupy; moves to `(1,3)` instead).
  - **Feedback**: "Correct"
  - **Player 2** is now at `(1,3)`.

#### Turn 3

- **Player 1's Move**:
  - Moves to `(2,2)`.
  - **Feedback**: "Correct"
  - **Player 1** is now at `(2,2)`.

- **Player 2's Move**:
  - Moves to `(2,4)`.
  - **Feedback**: "Incorrect"
  - Returns to `(1,3)`.

Players continue taking turns, using feedback to deduce the hidden path. The player who successfully reaches `(5,5)` first wins the game.

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

### Player Move

```
Player 1, your current position: (1,1)
Enter your move (row,column): 1,2
Feedback: Correct move!
```

### Invalid Move

```
Player 2, your current position: (1,1)
Enter your move (row,column): 3,3
Feedback: Invalid move. You can only move to an adjacent cell. Turn forfeited.
```

### Incorrect Move

```
Player 1, your current position: (1,2)
Enter your move (row,column): 2,3
Feedback: Incorrect move. Return to previous position.
```

### Winning Move

```
Player 1, your current position: (5,5)
Congratulations! You have reached the End Point and won the game!
```

## Strategies

### Observation

- Pay close attention to the opponent's moves and the feedback they receive.
- Use this information to infer parts of the hidden path.

### Memory

- Remember the outcomes of your previous moves.
- Avoid repeating incorrect moves.

### Logical Deduction

- Use the process of elimination to determine possible correct moves.
- Consider all possible adjacent cells that haven’t been attempted or were "Incorrect."

### Risk Management

- Decide whether to explore new paths or follow the opponent if they seem to be making progress.
- Balancing between exploration and cautious advancement can be key.

- The simplicity of the rules allows for quick gameplay and easy implementation in a command-line interface.
- Careful planning and keen observation give skilled players an edge over unskilled opponents.
- With no possibility of a draw and a race to the **End Point**, each game is engaging and competitive.
