In the custom environment for the "Blockade Run" game, the action space indices range from 0 to 624 and correspond to specific game actions based on two components: movement and block placement. Each action comprises two steps:

1. **Movement Index**: The first component (action index // 25) represents the cell to which the current player's piece will be moved. Since there are 25 possible cells on the 5x5 grid, this component can take values from 0 to 24, corresponding to cells 1 through 25 in row-major order.

2. **Block Placement Index**: The second component (action index % 25) determines where to place the block. This value also ranges from 0 to 24, corresponding to cells 1 through 25 in row-major order.

Thus, each action index uniquely specifies a move to a target cell and the placement of a block on another cell.
