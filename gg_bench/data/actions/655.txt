In the provided gym environment for the "Prime Clash" game, the action space indices directly correspond to the indices of the prime numbers in the predefined list `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]`. Each index from `0` to `9` in the action space represents selecting that position's prime number during a player's turn. For example, choosing action `0` equates to selecting the prime number `2`, action `1` equates to selecting `3`, and so on, up to action `9`, which selects `29`. This mapping allows players to select a prime number to apply as damage to their opponent's life total during their turn.
