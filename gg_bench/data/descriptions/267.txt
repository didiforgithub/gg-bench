**Game Name: Prime Division**

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Prime Division** is to be the player who reduces the shared number **N** to exactly **1** by dividing it by specific prime numbers. Players take turns dividing **N** by a valid prime factor. The player who reduces **N** to **1** on their turn **wins** the game. If a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., there are no allowable prime factors of **N**), that player **loses**.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Initial Number (N):**
   - Choose a starting number **N**, which must be a positive integer greater than **1**.
   - For a quick game, it's recommended to start with a moderately sized number like **210**.

2. **Players:**
   - This is a two-player game: **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
   - Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., flip a coin or agree amicably).

3. **Prime Divisors:**
   - The allowable prime numbers for division are **2**, **3**, **5**, and **7**.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (N):** The current number that players will manipulate during the game.
- **Prime Divisors List:** The set of primes **[2, 3, 5, 7]** that players can use to divide **N**.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Players will input their chosen prime numbers and receive updates through the CLI.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order:**
  - Players alternate turns starting with **Player 1**.

- **Player Actions:**
  - On their turn, a player must:
    1. **Identify Valid Primes:** Determine which primes from **[2, 3, 5, 7]** are factors of the current **N**.
    2. **Choose a Prime:** Select one of the valid prime factors.
    3. **Divide N:** Divide the current **N** by the chosen prime, resulting in a new **N**.
    4. **Announce Move:** Declare the chosen prime and the new value of **N**.

- **Turn Progression:**
  - The new **N** becomes the starting point for the next player's turn.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves:**
   - Players can only divide **N** by **2**, **3**, **5**, or **7**, and only if the prime is a factor of **N**.
   - If none of these primes are factors of **N**, the player cannot make a move and loses the game.

2. **Division:**
   - The division must result in an integer with no remainder.
   - Example: If **N = 30**, valid divisions are by **2**, **3**, or **5**.

3. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins by reducing **N** to exactly **1** on their turn.

4. **Losing the Game:**
   - A player loses if:
     - They cannot make a valid move on their turn.
     - They make an invalid move (e.g., dividing by a prime that is not a factor of **N**).

5. **No Skipping Turns:**
   - Players must make a valid move if possible; skipping a turn is not allowed.

6. **Example Moves:**
   - **Valid Move:** N = 14; player divides by 7; new N = 2.
   - **Invalid Move:** N = 14; player attempts to divide by 5 (since 5 is not a factor of 14).

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition:**
  - The game is won immediately when a player reduces **N** to **1**.
- **No Points System:**
  - There are no points or scoring beyond determining the winner of the game.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Initial Setup:**

- Starting **N**: **210**
- Players: **Player 1** and **Player 2**

**Game Progression:**

1. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **N = 210**
   - Valid primes: **2**, **3**, **5**, **7**
   - Chooses to divide by **7**
   - Calculation: **210 รท 7 = 30**
   - Announces: "I divide 210 by 7. New N is 30."

2. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **N = 30**
   - Valid primes: **2**, **3**, **5**
   - Chooses to divide by **5**
   - Calculation: **30 รท 5 = 6**
   - Announces: "I divide 30 by 5. New N is 6."

3. **Player 1's Turn:**
   - **N = 6**
   - Valid primes: **2**, **3**
   - Chooses to divide by **3**
   - Calculation: **6 รท 3 = 2**
   - Announces: "I divide 6 by 3. New N is 2."

4. **Player 2's Turn:**
   - **N = 2**
   - Valid prime: **2**
   - Chooses to divide by **2**
   - Calculation: **2 รท 2 = 1**
   - Announces: "I divide 2 by 2. New N is 1."
   - **Player 2 wins the game!**

#### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

```
Welcome to Prime Division!

Starting N is 210.

Player 1's turn.
Available primes to divide 210: [2, 3, 5, 7]
Enter prime to divide N: 7
Player 1 divides 210 by 7. New N is 30.

Player 2's turn.
Available primes to divide 30: [2, 3, 5]
Enter prime to divide N: 5
Player 2 divides 30 by 5. New N is 6.

Player 1's turn.
Available primes to divide 6: [2, 3]
Enter prime to divide N: 3
Player 1 divides 6 by 3. New N is 2.

Player 2's turn.
Available primes to divide 2: [2]
Enter prime to divide N: 2
Player 2 divides 2 by 2. New N is 1.

Congratulations, Player 2! You have reduced N to 1 and won the game!

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead:**
  - Anticipate the results of your move on future turns.
  - Try to force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.

- **Prime Factorization:**
  - Understanding the prime factors of numbers can give you an advantage.
  - Aim to leave **N** as a prime number that only you can exploit.

- **Control the Game Pace:**
  - Decide whether to reduce **N** quickly or slowly based on your strategy.

### **Conclusion**

**Prime Division** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players' mathematical skills and foresight. It's easy to code for a command-line interface and provides an engaging experience where a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled one. The game ends decisively with a victory for one player and has no mechanism for a draw, ensuring quick and clear outcomes.

Enjoy the challenge of prime numbers and may the best strategist win!
