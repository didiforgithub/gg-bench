# Command Line Conquer: Rule Book

## Objective

**Command Line Conquer** is a two-player turn-based strategy game played on a linear battlefield. The primary goal of the game is to capture your opponent's base by advancing your units across the battlefield. Players must strategically recruit and maneuver their units to overpower the enemy forces and reach the opponent's base. The first player to successfully move a unit into the opponent's base wins the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement

- **Moving Units**:
  - Units can only move **one position** per turn.
  - Units must move **towards the opponent's base**:
    - Player 1 units move from lower to higher positions (e.g., from 3 to 4).
    - Player 2 units move from higher to lower positions (e.g., from 7 to 6).
  - **Strength Increase**:
    - When a unit moves, its strength **increases by 1**.
    - Maximum strength is **5**; a unit cannot exceed this limit.

### Recruiting

- **Adding New Units**:
  - A player can recruit a new unit at their base if they have **fewer than 3 units** on the battlefield.
  - The new unit is placed at the player's base position with a **strength of 1**.

### Battles

- **Engagement**:
  - If a unit moves into a position occupied by an enemy unit, a **battle** occurs.
- **Battle Resolution**:
  - Compare the **strength** of the opposing units.
    - **Stronger Unit Wins**:
      - The unit with the higher strength remains on the position.
      - The weaker unit is **removed from the battlefield**.
    - **Tie**:
      - If both units have equal strength, **both units are removed** from the battlefield.
- **Post-Battle**:
  - The winning unit (if any) remains at the contested position.
  - There is **no additional strength gain** from winning a battle.

### Movement Restrictions

- **Maximum Units**:
  - A player can have a maximum of **3 units** on the battlefield at any time.
- **Occupying Bases**:
  - Players cannot have units at the opponent's base unless it's a move to **capture** it.
- **Strength Cap**:
  - Units cannot exceed a strength of **5**, even if they move multiple times.

### Victory Conditions

- **Winning the Game**:
  - A player **wins immediately** if one of their units moves into the opponent's base.
- **Defeat**:
  - A player **loses** if their base is captured by an opponent's unit.

### Additional Mechanics

- **Visibility**:
  - Both players can see the entire battlefield and the positions and strengths of all units.
- **No Skipping Turns**:
  - Players must perform an action on their turn; they cannot pass.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**:
  - The game does not use a point-based scoring system.
  - Victory is achieved by **capturing the opponent's base**.
- **Tracking Progress**:
  - Players should keep track of unit positions and strengths to plan their strategies effectively.
