In the custom gym environment for the Prime Rumble game, the action space indices map directly to the integer numbers available in the pool. Each index from 0 to 48 corresponds to a number from 2 to 50. Specifically, an action with index `i` represents selecting the number `i + 2`. Therefore, when a player chooses an action with index `i`, it indicates selecting and removing the number `i + 2` along with all its multiples within the pool.
