In the game environment, the action space is defined as a discrete set from 0 to 8, where each index corresponds to selecting a number from the shared pool of the game, which consists of numbers 1 to 9. Specifically, the action indices map to the numbers as follows: index 0 corresponds to the number 1, index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on, up to index 8, which corresponds to the number 9. The action chosen by a player thus directly selects a number by its position minus one in this index-based mapping.
