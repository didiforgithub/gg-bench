1. **Choosing Attack Numbers**:
   - On each turn, players select an attack number (**1** to **10**) without knowledge of the opponent's choice.
   - Players **cannot** choose the **same attack number they used in the immediate previous turn**.
2. **Damage Calculation**:
   - If one player's attack number is **higher** than the opponent's, they deal damage equal to the **difference between the numbers**.
   - If both players choose the **same number**, **no damage** is dealt.
3. **Health Points Reduction**:
   - Damage is **subtracted** from the opponent's HP.
   - HP cannot go below **0**; once it reaches **0**, the player loses.
4. **No Repeat Rule**:
   - Players must select a **different attack number** from their previous turn.
   - Violation of this rule results in an **automatic forfeit** of the game.
5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends when a player's HP is reduced to **0** or below.
   - The opposing player is declared the **winner**.
6. **Game Integrity**:

## Strategic Tips

- **Predict Opponent's Moves**:
  - Try to anticipate which numbers your opponent might choose based on their previous choices.
- **Vary Your Attack Numbers**:
  - Avoid patterns in your number selection to prevent the opponent from predicting your moves.
- **Manage High Numbers**:
  - Higher numbers can deal more damage if the opponent chooses a much lower number, but they may also leave you vulnerable if the opponent chooses an even higher number.
- **Use No Repeat Rule to Your Advantage**:
  - Keep track of numbers your opponent cannot use in the next turn to narrow down their possible choices.
