In the custom gym environment for the game, the action space indices map to player moves as follows:

- **Indices 0-4**: Correspond to attacking the opponent's blocks at the respective positions in their stack. For Player 1, these refer to Player 2's blocks, and for Player 2, these refer to Player 1's blocks. The index chosen must correspond to a block in the opponent's stack that is equal to or weaker than the top block of the current player's stack.
  
- **Index 5**: Represents passing the turn. This occurs when there are no valid blocks in the opponent's stack that can be attacked by the current player's top block, leading to an unsuccessful attack and removal of the top block without eliminating any opponent block.
