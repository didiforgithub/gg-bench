In this gym environment for the Dice Duel game, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(2)`, which means there are two possible actions: `0` and `1`. Here, the actions map to game moves as follows:

- **Action 0**: Corresponds to the move "Add," where the player chooses to add the rolled die value to their current score.
- **Action 1**: Corresponds to the move "Subtract," where the player chooses to subtract the rolled die value from their current score.
