   - The chosen number is removed from the Number Pool.
2. **Defense Phase**:
   - The defending player chooses how many HP to sacrifice to block the attack.
   - The block amount must be between **0** and the **attack number**.
3. **Damage Calculation**:
   - Calculate the **damage taken** and **total HP lost** by the defender.

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Attack Phase

- **Selection**:
  - Choose any available number from the Number Pool.
  - Announce the selected number to your opponent.
- **Number Usage**:
  - Each number can only be used once per game.

### 2. Defense Phase

- **Sacrifice HP to Block**:
  - Decide how much HP to sacrifice to reduce incoming damage.
  - **Block Amount**:
    - Must be a whole number between **0** and the **attack number**.
  - Announce the block amount to the attacker.

### 3. Damage Calculation

- **Damage Taken**:
  - **Damage Taken** = **Attack Number** - **Block Amount**
- **Total HP Lost**:
  - **Total HP Lost** = **Block Amount** (sacrificed) + **Damage Taken**
- **HP Adjustment**:
  - Subtract the **Total HP Lost** from the defender's current HP.

### 4. Health Management

- **Strategic Sacrifice**:
  - Sacrificing HP can reduce incoming damage but decreases your own HP.
- **Zero HP Limit**:
  - If a player's HP drops to **zero or below**, they lose the game.

### 5. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - Reduce your opponent's HP to **zero or below**.
- **Game End**:
  - The game ends immediately when the victory condition is met.

## Examples

### Initial State

- **Player A HP**: 50
- **Player B HP**: 50
- **Number Pool**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

---

### Example Turn Sequence

#### **Turn 1: Player A's Turn**

- **Attack Phase**:
  - **Player A** selects **7** from the Number Pool.
- **Defense Phase**:
  - **Player B** decides to sacrifice **3 HP** to block.
- **Damage Calculation**:
  - **Damage Taken** = 7 (attack) - 3 (block) = **4**
  - **Total HP Lost** = 3 (sacrificed) + 4 (damage) = **7 HP**
- **Result**:
  - **Player B HP**: 50 - 7 = **43 HP**
  - **Number Pool**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}

---

#### **Turn 2: Player B's Turn**

- **Attack Phase**:
  - **Player B** selects **9** from the Number Pool.
- **Defense Phase**:
  - **Player A** decides to sacrifice **0 HP** to block.
- **Damage Calculation**:
  - **Damage Taken** = 9 (attack) - 0 (block) = **9**
  - **Total HP Lost** = 0 (sacrificed) + 9 (damage) = **9 HP**
- **Result**:
  - **Player A HP**: 50 - 9 = **41 HP**
  - **Number Pool**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10}

---

#### **Turn 3: Player A's Turn**

- **Attack Phase**:
  - **Player A** selects **6** from the Number Pool.
- **Defense Phase**:
  - **Player B** decides to sacrifice **6 HP** to block.
- **Damage Calculation**:
  - **Damage Taken** = 6 - 6 = **0**
  - **Total HP Lost** = 6 + 0 = **6 HP**
- **Result**:
  - **Player B HP**: 43 - 6 = **37 HP**
  - **Number Pool**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10}

---

#### **Turn 4: Player B's Turn**

- **Attack Phase**:
  - **Player B** selects **10** from the Number Pool.
- **Defense Phase**:
  - **Player A** decides to sacrifice **5 HP** to block.
- **Damage Calculation**:
  - **Damage Taken** = 10 - 5 = **5**
  - **Total HP Lost** = 5 + 5 = **10 HP**
- **Result**:
  - **Player A HP**: 41 - 10 = **31 HP**
  - **Number Pool**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
