In the game environment, actions correspond to valid divisors greater than 1 for the current number. The action space indices are mapped to divisors as follows: each action index `i` represents the divisor `i + 2`. For instance, an action with index 0 corresponds to dividing by the divisor 2, index 1 corresponds to 3, and so on up to `max_starting_number - 1`, which corresponds to dividing by `max_starting_number`. This mapping ensures that the set of actions encompasses all possible valid divisors for any given current number.
