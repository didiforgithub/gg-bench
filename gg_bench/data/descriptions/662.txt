**Prime Path**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first player to reach Position 1 by strategically moving down a numerical path using prime number steps.

---

### **Setup**

- **Starting Position**: Both players begin at the highest position on a shared numerical path, designated as **N** (e.g., N = 20).
- **Agree on N**: Players decide on the starting number **N** before the game begins.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Numerical Path**: A sequence of numbered positions from **N** down to **1**.
  - Example for N = 20:
    ```
    [20][19][18][17][16][15][14][13][12][11][10][9][8][7][6][5][4][3][2][1]
    ```
- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a marker to indicate their current position on the path.
- **Prime Numbers**: A list of prime numbers less than **N** (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19).

---

### **Turns**

- **Order of Play**: Players alternate turns. Decide who goes first by mutual agreement or a random method.
- **Turn Actions**:
  - **Select a Prime Number**: Choose a prime number less than your current position.
  - **Move**: Subtract the chosen prime number from your current position to determine your new position.
  - **Announce Move**: Declare your chosen prime and new position.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - You **must** subtract a prime number less than your current position.
     - *Example*: If you're on position 15, valid primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.
   - The result must be a positive integer greater than 0.
   - You cannot move to a position occupied by your opponent.

2. **Occupied Positions**:
   - If the new position is occupied, you must choose a different prime.
   - If no valid moves are available (all possible positions are occupied or invalid), you lose your turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach **Position 1** wins.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose, and the other player wins.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Selecting a prime number equal to or greater than your current position is invalid.
   - Moving to a negative or zero position is invalid.
   - If an invalid move is made, you must choose a valid move before ending your turn.

### **Scoring**

- **Win Condition**: Reach Position 1 according to the rules.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; play continues until one player wins.

### **Example Gameplay**

#### *Starting the Game*

- **Players**: Alice (A) and Bob (B)
- **Starting Position (N)**: 10
- **Initial Positions**: Both at position 10.

#### *Turn-by-Turn Example*

1. **Alice's Turn**:
   - Current Position: 10
   - Available Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7
   - Chooses Prime: 3
   - New Position: 10 - 3 = **7**
   - Alice moves to position 7.

2. **Bob's Turn**:
   - Current Position: 10
   - Available Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7
   - Chooses Prime: 7
   - New Position: 10 - 7 = **3**
   - Bob moves to position 3.

3. **Alice's Turn**:
   - Current Position: 7
   - Available Primes: 2, 3, 5
   - Chooses Prime: 5
   - New Position: 7 - 5 = **2**
   - Alice moves to position 2.

4. **Bob's Turn**:
   - Current Position: 3
   - Available Prime: 2
   - Chooses Prime: 2
   - New Position: 3 - 2 = **1**
   - Bob moves to position 1 and **wins** the game.

### **Strategic Considerations**

- **Blocking**: Plan moves that block your opponent's path or limit their options.
- **Position Awareness**: Keep track of both positions to anticipate possible moves.
- **Prime Selection**: Choose primes that benefit your position while disadvantaging your opponent.

---

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

- **Prompt**: "Player A, you are at position 10. Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7. Enter your chosen prime:"
- **Player Input**: `3`
- **Output**: "Player A moves to position 7."
- **Next Prompt**: "Player B, you are at position 10. Available primes to subtract: 2, 3, 5, 7. Enter your chosen prime:"

---

### **Game End**

- **Victory Declaration**: The game announces when a player reaches position 1 or when the opponent cannot move.
- **Example**: "Player B has reached position 1 and wins the game!"

---

### **Conclusion**

"Prime Path" is a strategic numerical game that challenges players to think ahead and use basic arithmetic and prime numbers to outmaneuver their opponent. Its simple rules and quick gameplay make it ideal for command-line implementation while offering depth and replayability.
