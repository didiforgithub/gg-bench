**Factor Frenzy**

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Factor Frenzy** is to be the player who reduces the shared number, **N**, to **1** through strategic selection and division by its factors. Players take turns choosing factors of the current number and dividing the number by the chosen factor. The player who successfully reduces **N** to **1** wins the game. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn (no available factors), they lose the game.

---

### **Setup**

1. **Initial Number Selection**: The game starts with a positive integer **N**. By default, **N = 30**, but players can agree on any positive integer greater than **1** to increase or decrease the game's difficulty and length.

2. **Determine Turn Order**: Decide which player goes first. This can be done by mutual agreement, coin toss, or any random fair method.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Number (**_N_**)**: A positive integer that both players manipulate throughout the game. Starts at the agreed-upon initial value (default is 30).

- **Available Factors List**: A dynamic list of factors of the current **N** (excluding **1** and **N** itself). This list changes as **N** changes and factors are used.

- **Used Factors Set**: A set containing all factors that have been chosen previously. Used factors are removed from future consideration.

_No physical components are necessary; the game can be played entirely through command-line interaction._

---

### **Turns**

1. **Player Action**: On their turn, a player must:

   - **Choose a Valid Factor**: Select a factor of the current **N** that is neither **1** nor **N**, and that has not been used before.
   
   - **Divide**: Divide **N** by the chosen factor to get a new **N**.

2. **Turn Progression**:

   - **Update**: The chosen factor is added to the **Used Factors Set** and removed from future consideration.
   
   - **Announce**: The player announces their chosen factor and the new value of **N**.
   
   - **Check for Win/Loss Conditions**: If **N** is reduced to **1**, the player who made the last valid move wins. If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose.
   
   - **Next Turn**: The turn passes to the other player.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Moves**:

   - A move is valid if the player selects a factor of **N** (excluding **1** and **N**) that has not been previously used.
   
   - The chosen factor must divide **N** exactly (no remainders).

2. **Updating N**:

   - After dividing, **N** becomes the quotient of the division.

3. **Used Factors**:

   - Once a factor has been used, it cannot be selected again for the remainder of the game.
   
   - Players must keep track of used factors.

4. **Winning the Game**:

   - A player wins if they successfully reduce **N** to **1** on their turn.
   
   - If a player cannot make a valid move because there are no available factors (excluding **1** and **N**, or all factors have been used), they lose, and the other player wins.

5. **Illegal Moves**:

   - If a player attempts to make an invalid move (selects a non-factor, a used factor, or tries to divide resulting in a remainder), they forfeit their turn, and the other player may choose to enforce a loss or allow the player to retry (must be agreed upon before the game starts).

---

### **Scoring**

- **Victory**: The player who reduces **N** to **1** wins the game.
  
- **Forfeit**: If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose the game.

_No point system is involved; the game outcome is win or loss._

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Starting the Game**

- **N = 30**
- **Used Factors Set**: Empty
- **Player 1** and **Player 2** decide that Player 1 will start.

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Available Factors of 30**: 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
- **Move**: Player 1 chooses **5**
- **Calculation**: 30 รท 5 = **6**
- **Update**:
  - **N = 6**
  - **Used Factors Set**: {5}
- **Announcement**: "I divide by 5. N is now 6."

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Available Factors of 6**: 2, 3
- **Unused Factors**: 2, 3 (since 5 is already used)
- **Move**: Player 2 chooses **3**
- **Calculation**: 6 รท 3 = **2**
- **Update**:
  - **N = 2**
  - **Used Factors Set**: {3, 5}
- **Announcement**: "I divide by 3. N is now 2."

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Available Factors of 2**: None (excluding 1 and 2)
- **Unused Factors**: N/A
- **Move**: Player 1 has no valid factors to choose.
- **Result**: Player 1 cannot make a move and loses.
- **Announcement**: "I have no valid moves. You win!"

**Winner**: Player 2

#### **Command-Line Interaction Sample**

```
Game Start! N is 30.
Used Factors: None

Player 1's Turn:
Available Factors of 30 (excluding used factors): 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
Enter your chosen factor: 5
You chose 5.
N is now 6.
Used Factors: 5

Player 2's Turn:
Available Factors of 6 (excluding used factors): 2, 3
Enter your chosen factor: 3
You chose 3.
N is now 2.
Used Factors: 3, 5

Player 1's Turn:
Available Factors of 2 (excluding used factors): None
No valid moves left. Player 2 wins!
```

### **Strategic Notes**

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the factors that will be available to your opponent after your move.

- **Control the Game**: Aim to force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.

- **Factor Awareness**: Keep track of used factors to avoid illegal moves and to predict upcoming plays.

- **Prime Numbers**: Reducing **N** to a prime number (other than 2) can limit the available moves for the next player.
