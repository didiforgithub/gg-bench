# Mind Maze: Rule Book

### Objective
**Mind Maze** is a two-player turn-based deduction game. The primary goal is to be the first player to correctly deduce your opponent's secret number. Players achieve victory by asking strategic yes-or-no questions to narrow down the possibilities and making an accurate guess of the opponent's number. A win is achieved when a player successfully guesses the opponent's secret number, while a loss occurs if a player's guess is incorrect or if the opponent guesses your number first.

### Setup
1. **Secret Number Selection**: Each player secretly chooses an integer between **1** and **20**, inclusive. This number represents their secret number that the opponent will attempt to guess.
2. **Game Records**: Both players should have a means to record questions and answers, such as paper and pencil or a text file, to keep track of the information revealed during the game.

### Game Components
- **Number Range**: Integers from **1** to **20**, inclusive. These are the possible secret numbers.
- **Question Record**: A method for each player to record the questions asked and the answers received, aiding in the deduction process.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played in a command-line environment where players input questions and receive answers.

### Turns
1. **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first through mutual agreement or by a random method (e.g., coin toss).
2. **Player Actions**:
   - **Ask a Question**: On their turn, a player asks the opponent a single yes-or-no question about their secret number.
   - **Make a Guess**: Instead of asking a question, a player may choose to guess the opponent's secret number.
3. **Turn Progression**: After a player asks a question and receives an answer, or makes a guess, the turn passes to the opponent.

### Rules and Mechanics
1. **Types of Questions**:
   - Questions must be answerable with **"Yes"** or **"No"**.
   - Questions must pertain directly to the properties of the opponent's secret number.
   - Examples of valid questions:
     - "Is your number greater than 10?"
     - "Is your number an even number?"
     - "Is your number a prime number?"
     - "Is your number a multiple of 3?"
2. **Answering Questions**:
   - Players must answer all questions **truthfully** and **accurately** to the best of their knowledge.
   - Answers are limited to **"Yes"** or **"No"**.
3. **Making a Guess**:
   - A player can use their turn to guess the opponent's secret number instead of asking a question.
   - Each player has only **one opportunity** per game to guess the opponent's number.
   - If the guess is **correct**, the game ends, and the guessing player **wins**.
   - If the guess is **incorrect**, the game ends, and the guessing player **loses**.
4. **Restrictions**:
   - Players cannot ask questions that are not yes-or-no questions.
   - Players cannot ask questions that do not pertain to the opponent's secret number.
   - Players must not reveal their own secret number during the game.
5. **Deduction and Record-Keeping**:
   - Players are encouraged to keep track of all questions and answers to logically deduce the opponent's number.
   - Strategic questioning is vital to narrow down the possibilities efficiently.

### Scoring
- **Winning the Game**: The player who **first** correctly guesses the opponent's secret number wins the game.
- **Losing the Game**:
  - If a player makes an incorrect guess, they immediately lose, and the opponent wins.
  - If the opponent guesses your secret number before you guess theirs, you lose.
- **No Draws**: There are no draw conditions in **Mind Maze**. Each game results in a win for one player and a loss for the other.

### Strategy Tips

- **Efficient Questioning**: Aim to eliminate as many numbers as possible with each question. Questions that split the remaining possibilities roughly in half are ideal.
- **Keep Detailed Notes**: Record all answers to avoid confusion and to make logical deductions.
- **Balance Risk and Reward**: Deciding when to make your one allowed guess is crucial. Guess too early, and you risk losing the game; wait too long, and your opponent may guess first.
- **Anticipate Opponent's Choices**: Consider common strategies and numbers your opponent might choose and tailor your questions accordingly.

### Conclusion

**Mind Maze** is a game of logic, deduction, and strategic questioning. By carefully selecting your questions and keeping track of the information revealed, you can outsmart your opponent and emerge victorious. Enjoy the challenge of unraveling the mystery of your opponent's secret number!
