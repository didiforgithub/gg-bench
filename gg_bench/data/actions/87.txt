In the game environment, the action space is discrete with two possible actions represented by indices: 

- Index `0` corresponds to the move of adding an opening bracket `(` to the sequence.
- Index `1` corresponds to the move of adding a closing bracket `)` to the sequence.

This mapping allows the player to decide which type of bracket to add during their turn based on the available sequences.
