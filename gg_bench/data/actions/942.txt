In the "Number Wars" game implemented in the provided Gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, which represents integers 0 through 9. These indices map directly to the attack numbers, where action index 0 corresponds to the attack number 1, action index 1 corresponds to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 9, which corresponds to the attack number 10. This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index to determine the actual attack number used in the game.
