The action space in the game is defined using the `self.primes` list, which includes the prime numbers `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`. Each index of the `action_space` corresponds directly to one of these primes. Specifically, the mapping is as follows:

- Action index 0 maps to the prime number 2.
- Action index 1 maps to the prime number 3.
- Action index 2 maps to the prime number 5.
- Action index 3 maps to the prime number 7.
- Action index 4 maps to the prime number 11.
- Action index 5 maps to the prime number 13.

When an action is chosen (represented by an index), it selects the corresponding prime from the list to be used for the player's move in the game.
