# Factor Duel

**A Strategic Two-Player Turn-Based Game for the Command Line**

---

## Objective

The primary goal of **Factor Duel** is to be the player who reduces the shared number to **1**, thereby forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. Victory is achieved by strategically selecting factors to divide the shared number, leaving your opponent without options on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer known as the **starting number**. The default starting number is **60**, but players can agree on any positive integer greater than 1.

2. **Players**: Two players participate, taking turns manipulating the shared number according to the game rules.

3. **Interface**: The game is played through a command-line interface, displaying the shared number and prompting players for their moves.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: A positive integer that both players manipulate during the game. It starts at the agreed-upon starting number and changes as players make their moves.

- **Factors**: The positive integers greater than 1 that evenly divide the current shared number (excluding the number itself unless it's prime).

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**:

   - Players decide who goes first (Player 1 and Player 2).
   - Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.

2. **Player Actions**:

   - **Select a Factor**: On your turn, choose a valid factor of the current shared number (greater than 1).
   - **Divide the Shared Number**: Divide the shared number by the chosen factor.
   - **Update**: The result becomes the new shared number for the next turn.

3. **Progression**:

   - The game continues with players alternating turns and updating the shared number until the game ends.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### 1. Valid Moves

- **Choosing Factors**:

  - You must select a factor of the current shared number that is greater than 1 and less than the shared number.
  - The factor must divide the shared number evenly (no remainders).

- **Division**:

  - Divide the shared number by the chosen factor.
  - The result becomes the new shared number.

### 2. Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:

  - If you reduce the shared number to **1** on your turn, you **win** the game.
  - If the shared number becomes a **prime number**, the next player loses because they have no valid factors to choose from (since the only factors are 1 and itself, and 1 is not allowed).

- **Losing the Game**:

  - If you have no valid moves on your turn (because the shared number is **1** or a **prime number**), you **lose** the game.

### 3. Additional Rules

- **No Repetition Restrictions**:

  - Factors can be reused; there are no restrictions on selecting factors that have been used in previous turns.

- **Valid Factor Reminder**:

  - Dividing by **1** or the shared number itself (unless it's prime) is **not allowed**.

---

## Scoring

- **Single Game Win**:

  - The player who forces the shared number to **1** during their turn wins the game.

- **Match Play**:

  - Players may agree to play multiple rounds.
  - Keep track of wins, and the player with the most wins at the end of the match is the overall winner.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting Number**: 60

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Shared Number**: 60
- **Available Factors** (greater than 1): 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
- **Player 1 Chooses**: 5
- **Calculation**: 60 รท 5 = **12**
- **New Shared Number**: 12

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Current Shared Number**: 12
- **Available Factors**: 2, 3, 4, 6
- **Player 2 Chooses**: 4
- **Calculation**: 12 รท 4 = **3**
- **New Shared Number**: 3

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Shared Number**: 3
- **Available Factors**: None (since 3 is prime and factors are only 1 and itself)
- **Player 1** cannot make a valid move and **loses**.
- **Player 2** **wins** the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Game Start! The starting number is 60.

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number: 60
Available Factors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
Enter your chosen factor: 5
You divided 60 by 5.
New Shared Number is 12.

Player 2's Turn:
Current Number: 12
Available Factors: 2, 3, 4, 6
Enter your chosen factor: 4
You divided 12 by 4.
New Shared Number is 3.

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number: 3
No valid factors remaining. You cannot make a move.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategies

- **Avoid Prime Numbers**: Be cautious not to leave the shared number as a prime (other than 2) on your turn, as this may force you into a losing position.

- **Factor Selection**: Choose factors that reduce the shared number to a value with fewer factors for your opponent.

- **Anticipate Moves**: Plan ahead by calculating potential future shared numbers based on different factor choices.

---

## Game Variations

- **Custom Starting Number**:

  - Players can agree on a different starting number to change the game's difficulty and length.

- **Limited Factors**:

  - Introduce a rule where once a factor is used, it cannot be used again in the same game.

- **Time Challenge**:

  - Set a time limit for each turn to increase the pressure and excitement.

## Conclusion

**Factor Duel** is a simple yet strategically rich game that tests players' mathematical skills and foresight. Its straightforward mechanics make it easy to code and ideal for a command-line interface, while the depth of strategy ensures engaging and competitive gameplay.

Enjoy the duel, and may the best strategist win!
