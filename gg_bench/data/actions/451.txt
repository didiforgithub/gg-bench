In the given gym environment for Divisor Duel, the action space allows for integers from 0 to max_N (inclusive). However, valid game moves correspond to choosing a proper divisor of the current number N, which should be an integer greater than 1 and less than N itself that divides N evenly. Thus, the valid actions are those indices within the action space that represent proper divisors of N, excluding 0, 1, and numbers equal to or greater than N. Attempts to choose an invalid index result in the game ending with a penalty.
