The action space indices in the Quantum Flip game map to moves as follows:

- **Indices 0-24**: Each index corresponds to flipping one specific tile on the 5x5 grid, where index 0 represents tile A1, index 1 represents tile A2, continuing in row-major order up to index 24, which represents tile E5.
  
- **Indices 25 onward**: These indices correspond to Quantum Flip actions involving pairs of adjacent tiles. Each index beyond 24 represents one unique pair of adjacent tiles that can be flipped simultaneously. The precomputed adjacent pairs are sorted and each pair is uniquely associated with a specific index from 25 onwards.
