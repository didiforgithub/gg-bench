# CountDown Clash

## Objective

Be the first player to **reduce both Counter A and Counter B to zero** by strategically decrementing them during your turns. The player who reduces the second counter to zero wins the game.

## Setup

- The game features **two shared counters**:
  - **Counter A**: Initialized to **10**.
  - **Counter B**: Initialized to **10**.
- Both players start the game without any additional pieces or positions.

## Game Components

- **Counter A**:
  - Starts at **10**.
  - Represents one of the two targets players aim to reduce to zero.
- **Counter B**:
  - Starts at **10**.
  - Represents the second target for players to reduce to zero.
- **Players**:
  - **Player 1** and **Player 2** take alternating turns.
- **Actions**:
  - Players choose a counter and reduce it by a chosen amount within the allowed range on their turn.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.
- **On your turn**:
  1. **Choose a counter** to decrement: either **Counter A** or **Counter B**.
  2. **Select an amount** to reduce the chosen counter by:
     - The amount must be at least **1**.
     - The amount cannot exceed the current value of the chosen counter.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Counter Decrementing

- **Valid Moves**:
  - You must reduce **only one counter** per turn.
  - The decrement amount must be a **positive integer** between **1** and the counter's current value.
- **Updating Counters**:
  - Subtract the chosen amount from the selected counter.
  - The other counter remains unchanged.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**:
  - **You win** if, after your turn, **both Counter A and Counter B are exactly zero**.
  - This means you have reduced the second counter to zero on your turn.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game cannot end in a tie.
  - There are no scenarios where both players win simultaneously.

### Game Progression

- **Strategic Choices**:
  - Decide whether to focus on one counter or alternate between them.
  - Anticipate your opponent's moves based on the counters' values.
- **Forced Moves**:
  - If both counters are at zero, the game ends.
  - You must make a valid move if possible; passing is not allowed.

## Scoring

- **No Points System**:
  - The game does not track points.
  - The focus is solely on achieving the victory condition.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - The winner is the player who reduces the second counter to zero.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Initial State**:
- **Counter A**: 10
- **Counter B**: 10

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Chooses Counter A**.
- Reduces Counter A by **3**.
- **Counter A** is now **7**.
- **Counter B** remains **10**.

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Chooses Counter B**.
- Reduces Counter B by **5**.
- **Counter B** is now **5**.
- **Counter A** remains **7**.

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Chooses Counter A**.
- Reduces Counter A by **7**.
- **Counter A** is now **0**.
- **Counter B** remains **5**.

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Chooses Counter B**.
- Reduces Counter B by **5**.
- **Counter B** is now **0**.
- **Counter A** is already **0**.

**Outcome**:

- Both counters are zero.
- **Player 2 wins** by reducing the second counter to zero.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start!
Counter A: 10, Counter B: 10

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a counter to decrement (A/B): A
Enter amount to decrement (1-10): 3
Counter A is now 7
Counter B remains at 10

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a counter to decrement (A/B): B
Enter amount to decrement (1-10): 5
Counter B is now 5
Counter A remains at 7

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a counter to decrement (A/B): A
Enter amount to decrement (1-7): 7
Counter A is now 0
Counter B remains at 5

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a counter to decrement (A/B): B
Enter amount to decrement (1-5): 5
Counter B is now 0
Counter A is already 0

Both counters are zero.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**:
  - Anticipate your opponent's possible moves.
  - Plan your decrements to control the flow of the game.
- **Counter Control**:
  - Decide whether to focus on reducing one counter quickly or balance reductions across both.
- **Forcing Moves**:
  - Manipulate the counters to force your opponent into reducing a counter to a specific value, limiting their options.
- **Mathematical Calculations**:
  - Use basic arithmetic to calculate future states and strategize accordingly.

## Tips for Skilled Play

- **Monitor Counter Values**:
  - Keep track of the remaining values to predict future moves.
- **Optimal Decrements**:
  - Reducing counters to certain key values can force advantageous positions.
- **Opponent Anticipation**:
  - Consider what options your opponent will have after your turn.

## Summary

**CountDown Clash** is a simple yet strategically rich game where two players compete to be the first to reduce both shared counters to zero. By carefully choosing which counter to decrement and by how much, players can outmaneuver their opponent and secure victory. The game's straightforward mechanics make it easy to learn and play, while offering depth for those who wish to develop advanced strategies.
