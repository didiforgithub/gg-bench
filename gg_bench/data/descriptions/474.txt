# Operation Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Operation Duel** is a two-player turn-based game where the goal is to be the first player to reach the **target number** exactly by strategically applying mathematical operations to a **current number**. The player who successfully reaches the target number without exceeding it wins the game. If a player causes the current number to exceed the target number, they lose immediately.

---

## Setup

1. **Initial Number**: The game starts with a current number of **1**.
2. **Target Number**: The target number that players aim to reach is **20**.
3. **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2) by mutual agreement or a random method such as a coin toss.

---

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that both players manipulate during their turns. It starts at **1**.
- **Target Number**: A fixed number set at **20** that players aim to reach exactly.
- **Operations**: Players can perform specific mathematical operations on the current number during their turns.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players take turns alternately. Player 1 makes the first move, followed by Player 2.
2. **Actions Per Turn**:
   - **Add 1**: Increment the current number by 1.
   - **Multiply by 2**: Multiply the current number by 2.
3. **Turn Progression**:
   - After a player performs an operation, the turn passes to the other player.
4. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players must choose an operation that does not cause the current number to exceed the target number (20).
   - If no valid moves are available, the player loses their turn.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Operation Choices**:
   - On each turn, a player must choose one of the following operations to perform on the current number:
     - **Addition**: `current number = current number + 1`
     - **Multiplication**: `current number = current number * 2`
2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to adjust the current number to exactly **20** wins the game.
3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's operation causes the current number to exceed **20**, that player loses immediately.
4. **No Valid Moves**:
   - If a player has no valid operations that keep the current number at or below **20**, they lose their turn, and play passes to the opponent.
5. **Game End Conditions**:
   - **Win by Exact Match**: A player wins by reaching the target number exactly.
   - **Lose by Exceeding Target**: A player loses if they exceed the target number.
6. **Game Continuation**:
   - The game continues until one of the end conditions is met.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winning player is the one who reaches the target number of **20** exactly through strategic operations.
- **Loss**: The losing player is the one who either causes the current number to exceed **20** or is unable to make a valid move when it's their turn.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial State**:

- Current Number: 1
- Target Number: 20

**Turn 1**: Player 1's Turn
- **Action**: Multiply by 2
- **Calculation**: 1 * 2 = 2
- **Current Number After Turn**: 2

**Turn 2**: Player 2's Turn
- **Action**: Multiply by 2
- **Calculation**: 2 * 2 = 4
- **Current Number After Turn**: 4

**Turn 3**: Player 1's Turn
- **Action**: Add 1
- **Calculation**: 4 + 1 = 5
- **Current Number After Turn**: 5

**Turn 4**: Player 2's Turn
- **Action**: Multiply by 2
- **Calculation**: 5 * 2 = 10
- **Current Number After Turn**: 10

**Turn 5**: Player 1's Turn
- **Action**: Multiply by 2
- **Calculation**: 10 * 2 = 20
- **Current Number After Turn**: 20

**Outcome**:
- **Player 1 wins** by reaching the target number exactly.

### Invalid Move Example

**Current Number**: 19

**Player's Turn**:

- **Available Actions**:
  - Add 1: 19 + 1 = 20 (Valid)
  - Multiply by 2: 19 * 2 = 38 (Invalid, exceeds target number)

**Player Chooses**: Multiply by 2

**Outcome**:

- The current number becomes 38, which exceeds 20.
- **Player loses** immediately for exceeding the target number.
- **Opponent wins** the game.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Consider the potential results of both operations not just for your current turn but for future turns.
- **Force Opponent Errors**: Aim to leave the current number at a value where the opponent has limited or risky options.
- **Avoid Exceeding Target**: Always verify that your chosen operation won't cause the current number to surpass the target.
