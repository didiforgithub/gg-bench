The action space in the game is represented by 225 discrete actions, calculated as 25 possible cells on the 5x5 grid times 9 possible numbers (1 through 9) that can be placed in a cell. Each action index corresponds to a specific move, determined by the following mapping:

- The action index is divided by 9 to determine the cell index (from 0 to 24), which specifies which cell on the grid (0 corresponds to (1,1) or grid position 0 and 24 corresponds to (5,5) or grid position 24) the number will be placed in.
- The remainder of the action index when divided by 9 determines the number (from 0 to 8, corresponding to numbers 1 to 9), which is placed in the chosen cell.

Thus, each action index uniquely identifies a combination of grid cell and number placement for a given turn.
