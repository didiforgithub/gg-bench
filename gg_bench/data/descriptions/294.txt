# Divider

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a valid move by reducing the shared number according to the game rules. Force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move to win the game.

## Setup

- **Initial Number (N):** Choose a starting positive integer greater than 1. For a quick game, a smaller number like **16** is recommended.
- **Players:** Two players take turns.

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N):** A positive integer that changes throughout the game based on players' moves.

## Turns

- The game is played in alternating turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- On each turn, a player:
  1. **Selects a Proper Divisor:** Chooses a proper divisor of the current number **N** (a whole number greater than 1 and less than **N** that divides **N** without a remainder).
  2. **Divides the Number:** Divides **N** by the selected divisor.
  3. **Updates N:** The result becomes the new **N** for the next turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Proper Divisors

- A **proper divisor** of a number **N** is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than **N** that divides **N** exactly (without leaving a remainder).

### Valid Moves

- On their turn, a player must:
  - Choose a proper divisor of the current **N**.
  - Divide **N** by this divisor to obtain a new **N**.
- If a player cannot choose a proper divisor (because **N** is prime), they lose their turn and the game.

### Ending the Game

- The game ends when:
  - A player cannot make a valid move on their turn because **N** is a prime number.
  - The last player to make a valid move wins the game.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- The outcome is either a **win** or a **loss**.
- The player who forces the opponent into a position with no valid moves wins.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Starting N = 16**

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current **N**: 16
   - Proper divisors of 16: 2, 4, 8
   - **Player 1 selects 8**
   - New **N**: 16 รท 8 = **2**

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current **N**: 2
   - **2 is a prime number**
   - **Player 2 cannot make a valid move**
   - **Player 1 wins the game**

### Command-Line Interaction

```
Game Start! Initial N is 16.

Player 1's turn.
Current N is 16.
Choose a proper divisor of 16: 8
You chose 8. N is now 2.

Player 2's turn.
Current N is 2.
2 is a prime number with no proper divisors.
Player 2 cannot make a move.
Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Anticipate your opponent's potential moves and aim to leave them with a prime number on their turn.
- **Choose Larger Divisors Early:** Reducing **N** significantly can limit your opponent's options.
- **Avoid Prime Numbers on Your Turn:** Try not to leave yourself with a prime number when possible.

## Notes

- **Ease of Coding:** This game involves simple arithmetic operations and can be easily implemented in a command-line interface.
- **No Draws:** The game cannot end in a draw due to the nature of the moves and winning conditions.
- **Skill Matters:** Strategic planning allows a skilled player to consistently beat an unskilled player.

Enjoy playing **Divider** and may the best strategist win!
