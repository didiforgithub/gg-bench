# Divide and Conquer

## Objective

"Divide and Conquer" is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the player who reduces the shared number to exactly **1** through a series of permitted divisions. Victory is achieved by executing optimal strategies to force your opponent into a position where they cannot avoid the inevitable reduction to **1** on your turn.

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer **N**, set to **100**.
2. **Players**: Two players, Player 1 and Player 2, participate in the game.
3. **Turn Order**: Player 1 makes the first move.

_The initial setup simply requires the starting number to be displayed and the players to be assigned._

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: A positive integer that both players manipulate. Initially set to **100**.
- **Allowed Divisors**: Integers ranging from **2** to **9** (inclusive). These are the numbers players can choose to divide **N** by on their turn.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input their chosen divisors through the command line when prompted.

_No physical components are required. All game elements are managed digitally within the command-line interface._

## Turns

1. **Player Prompt**: On their turn, the player is prompted to input a divisor between **2** and **9**.
2. **Action Execution**: The shared number **N** is divided by the chosen divisor.
3. **Number Update**: **N** is updated to the integer part of the division result (i.e., discarded any fractional part).
4. **Turn Progression**: The turn passes to the next player unless the game has ended.

_Turns alternate between players until the game concludes._

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Divisors**: On each turn, a player must choose an integer between **2** and **9** (inclusive) to divide **N**.
2. **Division Process**: The shared number **N** is divided by the chosen divisor. Only the integer part of the result is kept. For example, if **N** is **7** and the divisor is **2**, **N** becomes **3**.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who reduces **N** to exactly **1** on their turn **wins** the game.
4. **Forced Move**: If a player is faced with **N** less than **2**, they lose their turn (though this scenario cannot occur under the rules if both players play correctly).
5. **Invalid Moves**: If a player inputs an invalid divisor (not an integer between **2** and **9** or one that doesn't divide **N**), they are prompted again for a valid input.

_The game's core mechanic revolves around strategic selection of divisors to control the progression of **N** towards **1**._

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who reduces **N** to exactly **1** wins the game.
- **No Points System**: There is no point accumulation or scoring system beyond winning or losing the game.

_Scoring is straightforward: the objective is to win the game by following the rules and applying strategic choices._

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

**Initial State**:
- **N** = 100

**Turn 1**: Player 1's turn
- **Player 1** chooses to divide by **2**.
- **Calculation**: 100 รท 2 = **50**
- **N** is now **50**.

**Turn 2**: Player 2's turn
- **Player 2** chooses to divide by **5**.
- **Calculation**: 50 รท 5 = **10**
- **N** is now **10**.

**Turn 3**: Player 1's turn
- **Player 1** chooses to divide by **2**.
- **Calculation**: 10 รท 2 = **5**
- **N** is now **5**.

**Turn 4**: Player 2's turn
- **Player 2** chooses to divide by **5**.
- **Calculation**: 5 รท 5 = **1**
- **N** is now **1**.

**Outcome**:
- **Player 2** has reduced **N** to **1** and wins the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

```
Starting Number (N): 100

Player 1's turn.
Enter a divisor between 2 and 9: 2
N is now 50.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a divisor between 2 and 9: 5
N is now 10.

Player 1's turn.
Enter a divisor between 2 and 9: 2
N is now 5.

Player 2's turn.
Enter a divisor between 2 and 9: 5
N is now 1.

Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Depth

To excel at "Divide and Conquer," players should:

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the results of possible divisors to control the future value of **N**.
- **Control the Game**: Force the opponent into positions where their options are limited.
- **Mathematical Calculation**: Calculate the outcomes of different divisors to make optimal choices.

Understanding the mathematical properties of numbers and divisibility can provide a significant advantage, allowing a skilled player to consistently outperform an unskilled opponent.
