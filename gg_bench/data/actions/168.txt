In the game, the action space indices (0-8) map to the digits (1-9) that players choose to append to the cumulative number. Specifically, action index 0 corresponds to appending the digit 1, index 1 corresponds to appending the digit 2, and so on, up to index 8, which corresponds to appending the digit 9. Each action index directly represents its corresponding digit in increasing order from 1 to 9.
