In the environment, the action space is discrete with indices ranging from 0 to 7. Each index corresponds to a specific factor from the game's factor pool (2 to 9). This mapping is direct: the index 0 corresponds to choosing the factor 2, index 1 corresponds to choosing the factor 3, and so on, up to index 7 which corresponds to choosing the factor 9.
