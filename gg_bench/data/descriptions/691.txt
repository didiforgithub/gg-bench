### **Strategic Tips**

- **Energy Management**:
  - Balance your EP between attacking and charging.
  - Anticipate your opponent's moves to avoid running out of EP.

- **Attack Timing**:
  - High-cost attacks (3 EP) deal significant damage but deplete your own EP quickly.
  - Consider the opponent's EP before choosing your Attack Cost.

- **Charging Strategically**:
  - Use charging to recover EP when low.
  - Be cautious: charging gives the opponent an opportunity to attack.

- **Predicting Opponent's Moves**:
  - Observe patterns in your opponent's actions.
  - If the opponent has low EP, they may be forced to charge.
