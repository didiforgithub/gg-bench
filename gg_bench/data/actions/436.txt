In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, representing numbers 1 through 10. Each action index corresponds to a specific number move as follows: action index 0 corresponds to choosing the number 1, action index 1 corresponds to choosing the number 2, and so on up to action index 9 corresponding to choosing the number 10. This mapping allows players to select a number by specifying the associated action index.
