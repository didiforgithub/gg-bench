The action space indices in the game map to the combination of movement directions and block placements. Each action index in the range of 0 to 91 is calculated as:

\[ \text{action\_index} = (\text{move\_direction} \times \text{num\_block\_positions}) + \text{block\_position\_index} \]

Where:
- **`move_direction`** (0 to 3) maps to one of the four possible movement directions: 
  - 0: Up (-1, 0)
  - 1: Down (1, 0)
  - 2: Left (0, -1)
  - 3: Right (0, 1)
- **`num_block_positions`** is 23, representing the total number of possible block positions.
- **`block_position_index`** maps to a specific valid block position on the grid.

This index calculation ensures that each action uniquely corresponds to a pair of movement and block placement choices.
