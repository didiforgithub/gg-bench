**Sum Battle**

---

**Objective**

Sum Battle is a two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach an exact cumulative total of **15** by selecting numbers from a shared pool. A player wins by achieving a cumulative score of **15** without exceeding it. If a player's cumulative score exceeds **15**, they lose immediately. The game emphasizes strategic selection to reach the target while potentially blocking the opponent.

**Setup**

1. **Shared Number Pool**: Initialize the game with a shared pool of numbers from **1** to **9**.
   - *Shared Pool*: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`

2. **Player Scores**: Both players start with a cumulative score of **0**.
   - *Player 1 Score*: `0`
   - *Player 2 Score*: `0`

3. **Determine First Player**: Decide which player will take the first turn.
   - This can be done by mutual agreement or by using a random method such as a coin toss.

**Game Components**

- **Shared Number Pool**:
  - A collection of numbers from **1** to **9** available for selection.
  - Numbers are removed from the pool once selected.

- **Player Scores**:
  - Each player maintains their own cumulative score.
  - Scores are updated each turn by adding the selected number.

---

**Turns**

Players take turns performing the following actions:

1. **Select a Number**:
   - Choose one available number from the shared pool.
   - Example command: `select 5`

2. **Update Score**:
   - Add the selected number to your cumulative score.
   - Example: If your score was `7` and you selected `5`, your new score is `12`.

3. **Remove Number from Pool**:
   - The selected number is removed from the shared pool and cannot be selected again.

4. **Turn Progression**:
   - The turn passes to the other player after the above actions are completed.

**Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Number Selection**:
   - On your turn, you **must** select one number from the available numbers in the shared pool.
   - You cannot skip a turn or pass.

2. **Score Limit**:
   - Your cumulative score must not exceed **15**.
   - If selecting a number would cause your score to exceed **15**, you **still must select a number** and consequently lose the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - You win if:
     - Your cumulative score reaches exactly **15**.
     - Your opponent's score exceeds **15**.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - You lose if:
     - Your cumulative score exceeds **15**.
     - Your opponent reaches a cumulative score of **15** before you.

5. **End of Numbers**:
   - If all numbers are exhausted from the pool and no player has reached a cumulative score of **15**, the player with the **highest cumulative score without exceeding 15** wins the game.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw due to the finite pool of numbers and the win/loss conditions.

**Scoring**

- **Cumulative Score Tracking**:
  - Keep a running total of the numbers you have selected.
  - Example:
    - Turn 1: Select `4` → Cumulative Score: `4`
    - Turn 2: Select `6` → Cumulative Score: `10`

- **Winning Condition**:
  - Achieve a cumulative score of exactly **15**.

- **Losing Condition**:
  - Exceed a cumulative score of **15**.

**Strategic Notes**

- **Planning Ahead**:
  - Keep track of both your own and your opponent's cumulative scores.
  - Anticipate which numbers your opponent might need and consider selecting them to block their path to 15.

- **Avoiding Overextension**:
  - Be cautious when your cumulative score is close to 15.
  - Selecting a number that causes you to exceed 15 results in an immediate loss.

- **Forcing Opponent's Hand**:
  - Leave numbers in the pool that, if taken by your opponent, would cause them to exceed 15.
  - This can pressure your opponent into a difficult decision.
