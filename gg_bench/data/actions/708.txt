In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 10 possible actions, corresponding to the numbers 1 through 10 in the game. The mapping is as follows: 

- Action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1.
- Action index 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2.
- Action index 2 corresponds to selecting the number 3.
- Action index 3 corresponds to selecting the number 4.
- Action index 4 corresponds to selecting the number 5.
- Action index 5 corresponds to selecting the number 6.
- Action index 6 corresponds to selecting the number 7.
- Action index 7 corresponds to selecting the number 8.
- Action index 8 corresponds to selecting the number 9.
- Action index 9 corresponds to selecting the number 10.

This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index to determine the corresponding number in the game.
