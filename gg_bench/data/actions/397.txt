In the game environment, the action space indices [0-8] correspond to the numbers 1-9. Each index maps directly to a number in the shared pool by adding 1 to the index. For example, an action of index 0 maps to the number 1, index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on up to index 8, which maps to the number 9. This mapping allows players to select a number from the shared pool by choosing the corresponding index in the action space.
