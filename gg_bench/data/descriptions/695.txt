# Divide and Conquer

---

## Objective

Be the first player to reduce the shared number to exactly **1** on your turn by dividing it by a chosen divisor and rounding down to the nearest whole number.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting Number**: Decide on a starting positive integer greater than 1. A common choice is **100**.
2. **Player Order**: Determine who will be **Player 1** and **Player 2**. You can flip a coin or agree amicably.
3. **Game Interface**: Use a command-line interface to input moves and display the game's progress.

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number**: An integer that both players manipulate throughout the game. It starts at the chosen starting number.
- **Divisors**: Players can choose any integer between **2** and **9** (inclusive) as a divisor on their turn.
- **No Physical Pieces**: The game requires only the shared number and the available divisors. All tracking is done via the command-line interface.

---

## Turns

### Turn Structure

1. **Current Shared Number Display**: The game announces the current shared number.
2. **Player's Choice of Divisor**:
   - The active player chooses a divisor between **2** and **9** (inclusive).
3. **Calculation**:
   - Divide the shared number by the chosen divisor.
   - If the result is not a whole number, round it down to the nearest whole number (use floor division).
4. **Update Shared Number**:
   - The result becomes the new shared number for the next turn.
5. **Turn Ends**:
   - The turn passes to the other player.

### Progression of Turns

- Players alternate turns following the above structure until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing Divisors**:
   - On your turn, you must select a divisor between **2** and **9**.
   - You can choose any valid divisor on each turn, regardless of previous choices.
2. **Division and Rounding**:
   - Perform integer division of the shared number by your chosen divisor.
   - If the division results in a decimal, round down to the nearest whole number.
     - For example, **7 ÷ 3** equals **2** (since 7/3 ≈ 2.33, which rounds down to 2).
3. **Updating the Shared Number**:
   - The result after rounding down becomes the new shared number.
   - This new number is used by the next player on their turn.
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces the shared number to exactly **1** on their turn **wins** the game.
5. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts to use a divisor not between **2** and **9**, they must choose a valid divisor.
6. **No Skipping Turns**:
   - Players cannot skip their turn; a valid divisor must be chosen each turn.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- The first player to reduce the shared number to **1** wins the game.
- The game is quick, focusing on strategic choices rather than accumulated scoring.

## Examples

### Sample Game Play

**Starting Shared Number**: 100

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 100
- **Player 1's Divisor Choice**: 2
- **Calculation**: 100 ÷ 2 = 50
- **New Shared Number**: 50

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Current Number**: 50
- **Player 2's Divisor Choice**: 3
- **Calculation**: 50 ÷ 3 ≈ 16.66... → 16 (after rounding down)
- **New Shared Number**: 16

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 16
- **Player 1's Divisor Choice**: 2
- **Calculation**: 16 ÷ 2 = 8
- **New Shared Number**: 8

#### Turn 4: Player 2

- **Current Number**: 8
- **Player 2's Divisor Choice**: 3
- **Calculation**: 8 ÷ 3 ≈ 2.66... → 2 (after rounding down)
- **New Shared Number**: 2

#### Turn 5: Player 1

- **Current Number**: 2
- **Player 1's Divisor Choice**: 2
- **Calculation**: 2 ÷ 2 = 1
- **New Shared Number**: 1

**Result**: **Player 1 wins** by reducing the shared number to **1**.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```plaintext
Welcome to Divide and Conquer!
Starting number is 100.

Player 1's turn.
Current number: 100
Choose a divisor between 2 and 9: 2
You chose to divide by 2.
Calculation: 100 / 2 = 50
New number is 50.

Player 2's turn.
Current number: 50
Choose a divisor between 2 and 9: 3
You chose to divide by 3.
Calculation: 50 / 3 = 16 (after rounding down)
New number is 16.

Player 1's turn.
Current number: 16
Choose a divisor between 2 and 9: 2
You chose to divide by 2.
Calculation: 16 / 2 = 8
New number is 8.

Player 2's turn.
Current number: 8
Choose a divisor between 2 and 9: 3
You chose to divide by 3.
Calculation: 8 / 3 = 2 (after rounding down)
New number is 2.

Player 1's turn.
Current number: 2
Choose a divisor between 2 and 9: 2
You chose to divide by 2.
Calculation: 2 / 2 = 1
New number is 1.

Congratulations, Player 1! You have reduced the number to 1 and won the game!

## Strategic Depth and Complexity

- **Anticipate Opponent's Moves**: Plan your divisor choices to control the shared number, forcing your opponent into a losing position.
- **Key Numbers**: Recognize certain numbers that, when reached, can guarantee a win if played correctly.
- **Divisor Selection**: Choosing higher divisors reduces the shared number more significantly but may open opportunities for your opponent. Balancing your choices is crucial.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force the opponent into a position where no matter what divisor they choose, you can win on your next turn.

---

## Tips for Players

- **Think Ahead**: Always consider how your move will affect the next turn.
- **Control the Pace**: Manipulate the shared number to limit your opponent's options.
- **Practice**: Familiarize yourself with different starting numbers to develop winning strategies.

## Conclusion

Divide and Conquer is a fast-paced, strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and make calculated decisions. With simple rules and minimal requirements, it's perfect for quick matches and easy to implement in a command-line interface. Mastery comes from understanding the mathematical implications of each move, ensuring that skillful play is rewarded.
