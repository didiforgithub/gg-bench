# Gridlock: A Two-Player Command-Line Strategy Game

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a valid move. Players take turns placing markers on a grid while strategically blocking their opponent's options. The player who makes the final valid move wins the game.

## Setup

- **Grid Initialization**: The game is played on a 5x5 grid of empty cells.
- **Starting Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by mutual agreement or random selection).

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A 5x5 grid represented in the command-line interface. Each cell is identified by its row and column numbers (e.g., `(1,1)` for the top-left corner).
  
  ```
    1   2   3   4   5
  +---+---+---+---+---+
1 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
2 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
3 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
4 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
5 |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  ```
  
- **Markers**: Each player uses a unique marker to denote their placed cells:
  - Player 1: `X`
  - Player 2: `O`
  
- **Blocked Cells**: Cells that are unavailable for selection, marked as `#`.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Selection Phase**: The active player selects an available (unblocked and unoccupied) cell to place their marker.
  2. **Blocking Phase**: Upon placing their marker, all orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to the selected cell become blocked and are marked with `#`.
  3. **Turn End**: The turn ends, and control passes to the opponent.

- **Turn Progression**:
  - Players alternate turns.
  - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they lose the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Valid Moves**:
  - A cell is valid for selection if it is not already occupied (`X` or `O`) and is not blocked (`#`).
  - Players must select a valid cell on their turn.

- **Blocking Mechanism**:
  - After placing a marker, immediately block all orthogonally adjacent cells.
  - Diagonal cells are not affected.
  - If an adjacent cell is already occupied or blocked, no additional action is needed.

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The game continues until one player cannot make a valid move on their turn.
  - The last player to make a valid move wins the game.
  
- **Game End Condition**:
  - A player loses if:
    - There are no valid cells available on their turn.
    - They forfeit or concede the game.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: The winning player is the one who successfully places the last marker.
- **No Point System**: There is no scoring or point tracking beyond determining the winner.

## Strategy Tips

- **Control the Center**: Placing your marker near the center can block more options for your opponent.
- **Force Moves**: Try to limit the available cells in such a way that your opponent has fewer choices.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate the blocking effect of your move on future turns.
- **Avoid Corners Early**: Corner cells block fewer cells; save them for later in the game.

## Conclusion

Gridlock is a strategic game that combines foresight and tactical planning. By understanding the blocking mechanics and anticipating your opponent's moves, you can gain a strategic advantage and secure victory. Enjoy the challenge and may the best strategist win!
