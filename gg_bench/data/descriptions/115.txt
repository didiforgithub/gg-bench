**Strategic Tips:**

- **Aim for Totals Just Below Multiples of 7:**
  - Try to leave the cumulative total at **6, 13, 20,** etc. (one less than a multiple of 7) after your turn. This forces the opponent into a position where any addition from 1 to 5 will cause them to lose.

- **Memorize Safe Totals:**
  - Safe totals are those that are not one less than a multiple of 7. Avoid bringing the total to these numbers on your turn.

- **Predict Opponent's Moves:**
  - Anticipate what numbers your opponent might add and plan your moves to avoid giving them an advantage.

---

**Ensure Fair Play:**

- **Valid Moves Only:**
  - Players must adhere strictly to the rules regarding number selection and updating the total.

- **Honesty in Reporting Totals:**
  - The cumulative total should be accurately reported after each turn to maintain game integrity.
