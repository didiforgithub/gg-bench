In the CustomEnv gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 9 actions, corresponding to selecting one of the weight tokens numbered from 1 to 9. The action indices (0-8) directly map to the weight values (1-9) by adding 1 to the action index. For example, an action with index 0 selects the weight token 1, an action with index 1 selects the weight token 2, and so forth up to index 8, which selects the weight token 9.
