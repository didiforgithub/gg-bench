# Prime Path

## Objective

Be the first player to reach exactly position 25 on a numerical path by strategically selecting prime numbers to advance. Outmaneuver your opponent by managing prime resources and positioning, while potentially sending them back to the start.

## Setup

- **Numerical Path**: A linear path numbered from **1** to **25**.
- **Starting Position**: Both players begin at **position 0**, just before the number 1.
- **Player Tokens**: Each player has a token represented by their name or initials.
- **Prime Number Pool**: A shared list of prime numbers less than 20: **[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide who goes first (coin toss, agreement, etc.).

## Game Components

- **Numerical Path**: A sequence of numbers from 1 to 25 displayed linearly.
- **Player Tokens**: Indicators of each player's current position on the path.
- **Prime Number Pool**: The list of available prime numbers for movement.

## Turns

- Players take turns alternately.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Select a Prime**: Choose a prime number from the available pool.
  2. **Move Token**: Advance your token forward by the number selected.
  3. **Update Prime Pool**: Remove the chosen prime from the pool.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting Primes**:
   - Choose any available prime number from the pool on your turn.
   - Once a prime is used, it's **removed** from the pool.

2. **Moving the Token**:
   - Advance your token forward by the exact number of spaces equal to the chosen prime.
   - Movement is **only forward**; no backward moves allowed.

3. **Landing on the Opponent**:
   - If you land on the same position as your opponent, their token is sent back to **position 0**.
   - If both players are on position 0, they coexist without affecting each other.

4. **Exact Landing**:
   - To win, you must land **exactly** on position 25.
   - Moves that would take you beyond 25 are **invalid**; you must choose a different prime.

5. **No Valid Moves**:
   - If no available primes allow a valid move, you **skip your turn**.
   - Managing primes to avoid this scenario is part of the strategy.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The first player to land exactly on **position 25** wins.
- There is no point system; the game is won by reaching the end of the path first.

## Examples

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses prime **19**.
   - Moves to **position 19**.
   - Prime Pool now: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17]

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Cannot use **17** (13+17=30 > 25).
   - Chooses prime **7**.
   - Moves to **position 20**.
   - Prime Pool now: [2, 3, 5, 11, 17]

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses prime **5**.
   - Moves to **position 24**.
   - Prime Pool now: [2, 3, 11, 17]

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses prime **3**.
   - Moves to **position 23**.
   - Prime Pool now: [2, 11, 17]

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Cannot use any primes (all moves exceed 25).
   - **Skips turn**.

7. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses prime **2**.
   - Moves to **position 25**.
   - **Player 1 wins!**

## Strategic Depth

- **Prime Resource Management**: Decide when to use high or low primes. Using large primes early can be advantageous but may limit options later.
- **Position Awareness**: Keep track of both players' positions to avoid aiding your opponent or to plan sending them back to start.
- **Blocking Moves**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves to block them by removing certain primes from the pool.
- **Forced Skips**: Strategically use primes to force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves.

By mastering prime management and anticipating your opponent's options, you can consistently outplay less skilled players in **Prime Path**.
