**Game Title**: Reach 100 - A Strategic Multiplication Game

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Reach 100** is to be the first player to reach **exactly 100** by strategically multiplying a cumulative product. Players must carefully choose their multipliers to reach the target without exceeding it. If a player's move causes the cumulative product to exceed 100, they lose the game.

---

### **Setup**

- **Players**: Two players participate in the game.
- **Starting Value**: The game begins with a cumulative product of **1**.
- **Game Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their chosen multipliers.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Cumulative Product**: A shared number starting at 1, updated after each turn.
- **Available Multipliers**: Numbers from **2** to **9** inclusive. Players use these to multiply the cumulative product on their turn.

---

### **Turns**

Players take turns alternately throughout the game.

**Turn Structure**:

1. **Display**: The current cumulative product is displayed to both players.
2. **Action**: The active player chooses a multiplier between 2 and 9.
3. **Calculation**: The cumulative product is multiplied by the chosen multiplier.
4. **Update**: The new cumulative product is announced.
5. **Check**: Determine if the cumulative product is exactly 100 (win), exceeds 100 (lose), or if the game continues.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Choosing a Multiplier**:
   - On your turn, select a multiplier between **2** and **9** inclusive.
   - Input this number when prompted.

2. **Updating the Cumulative Product**:
   - Multiply the current cumulative product by your chosen multiplier.
   - The result becomes the **new cumulative product**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If your move results in the cumulative product being **exactly 100**, you **win** the game.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If your move causes the cumulative product to **exceed 100**, you **lose** the game, and your opponent wins.

5. **Continuing Play**:
   - If the cumulative product is less than 100 after your turn, the game continues to the next player.

6. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Choosing a multiplier outside the range of **2** to **9** is invalid.
   - If an invalid move is made, you must choose again.

7. **Strategic Play**:
   - Anticipate future cumulative products to avoid exceeding 100.
   - Consider available multipliers to force your opponent into a losing position.

### **Scoring**

### **Examples**

#### **Sample Gameplay**

**Starting the Game**:
- **Cumulative Product**: 1

---

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Current Product**: 1
- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **5**
- **Calculation**: 1 × 5 = **5**
- **New Product**: 5

---

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Current Product**: 5
- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **4**
- **Calculation**: 5 × 4 = **20**
- **New Product**: 20

---

**Player 1's Turn**:
- **Current Product**: 20
- **Action**: Chooses multiplier **3**
- **Calculation**: 20 × 3 = **60**
- **New Product**: 60

---

**Player 2's Turn**:
- **Current Product**: 60
- **Decision Point**:
  - Multiplying by 2: 60 × 2 = 120 (exceeds 100)
  - Any multiplier (2-9) will cause the product to exceed 100.
- **Outcome**: Cannot make a valid move without exceeding 100.
- **Result**: **Player 2 loses**, **Player 1 wins**.

---

#### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

```plaintext
Cumulative Product: 1
Player 1, choose a multiplier (2-9): 5
New Cumulative Product: 5

Cumulative Product: 5
Player 2, choose a multiplier (2-9): 4
New Cumulative Product: 20

Cumulative Product: 20
Player 1, choose a multiplier (2-9): 3
New Cumulative Product: 60

Cumulative Product: 60
Player 2, choose a multiplier (2-9): 2
Invalid move! Multiplying will exceed 100.
Player 2 has no valid moves and loses.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

### **Strategic Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Always calculate potential outcomes for both your move and your opponent's next move.
- **Critical Numbers**: Be aware of cumulative products where any multiplier will force an exceed (e.g., 60 × 2 = 120).
- **Force Errors**: Try to put your opponent in a position where any choice they make will cause them to exceed 100.
- **Multiplier Selection**: Early in the game, lower multipliers can provide more control in the late game.

### **Conclusion**

**Reach 100** is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and make calculated decisions. With straightforward rules and quick gameplay, it offers an engaging experience where skillful planning can consistently lead to victory.
