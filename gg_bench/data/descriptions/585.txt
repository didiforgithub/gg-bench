# Divisor Duel

## Objective

Be the player to force your opponent into a position where they **cannot make a valid move**, by strategically dividing the current number by its proper divisors. This typically happens when the current number on your opponent's turn is **1** or a **prime number** greater than 1. The player who forces their opponent into such a position **wins** the game.

## Setup

- The game begins with a shared positive integer called the **Current Number**.
- The **Initial Current Number** is **100**.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A positive integer shared between both players, starting at **100**.
- **Proper Divisors**: For any Current Number, these are the positive integers **greater than 1 and less than the Current Number** that divide it evenly (without leaving a remainder).

## Turns

Players take turns in alternating order, starting with **Player 1**.

### On Your Turn

1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: List all proper divisors of the Current Number.
2. **Select a Proper Divisor**: Choose one proper divisor from the list.
3. **Divide the Current Number**: Divide the Current Number by the selected proper divisor.
4. **Update the Current Number**: The result becomes the new Current Number.
5. **Announce the Move**: State the chosen divisor and the new Current Number.

### Example Turn

- **Current Number**: 100
- **Proper Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
- **Player's Choice**: Select 25
- **Calculation**: 100 ÷ 25 = 4
- **New Current Number**: 4
- **Announcement**: "I divide 100 by 25. The new Current Number is 4."

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Proper Divisor Selection**
   - You **must** choose a proper divisor of the Current Number on your turn.
   - A proper divisor is an integer greater than 1 and less than the Current Number that divides it evenly.
   - **1** and the Current Number itself are **not** proper divisors and cannot be selected.

2. **Valid Moves**
   - If you cannot make a valid move because there are no proper divisors (i.e., the Current Number is prime or 1), you **lose** the game.
   - The division must result in an integer. Fractions or decimals are not allowed.

3. **Winning the Game**
   - You win if your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
   - This happens when the Current Number on their turn is a **prime number** (greater than 1) or **1**.

4. **Division Mechanics**
   - Always perform integer division; ensure the result is a whole number.
   - Update the Current Number immediately after your turn.

5. **No Reversing Moves**
   - Once a move is made, it cannot be reversed. Be strategic with your choices.

## Scoring

- The game is won by a single player when the opponent cannot make a valid move.
- There are no points or cumulative scoring; it's a win/loss outcome per game.

## Examples

### Example Game 1

**Starting Current Number**: 100

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Proper Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
   - Chooses: 25
   - Calculation: 100 ÷ 25 = 4
   - Announces: "I divide 100 by 25. The new Current Number is 4."

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Number: 4
   - Proper Divisors: 2
   - Chooses: 2
   - Calculation: 4 ÷ 2 = 2
   - Announces: "I divide 4 by 2. The new Current Number is 2."

3. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Current Number: 2
   - Proper Divisors: None (since 2 is prime)
   - **No valid moves available**
   - **Player 1 loses. Player 2 wins.**

### Example Game 2

**Starting Current Number**: 60

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30
   - Chooses: 30
   - Calculation: 60 ÷ 30 = 2
   - Announces: "I divide 60 by 30. The new Current Number is 2."

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Number: 2
   - Proper Divisors: None
   - **No valid moves available**
   - **Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins.**

### Example Game 3

**Starting Current Number**: 24

1. **Player 1's Turn**
   - Proper Divisors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
   - Chooses: 12
   - Calculation: 24 ÷ 12 = 2
   - Announces: "I divide 24 by 12. The new Current Number is 2."

2. **Player 2's Turn**
   - Current Number: 2
   - Proper Divisors: None
   - **No valid moves available**
   - **Player 2 loses. Player 1 wins.**

## Strategy Tips

- **Aim for Primes**: Try to leave a prime number as the Current Number on your opponent's turn.
- **Consider Divisibility**: Select a divisor that reduces the Current Number to a number with few or no proper divisors.
- **Anticipate Moves**: Think ahead about possible divisors your opponent can use on their turn.
- **Avoid Leaving Composite Numbers**: Leaving numbers with many divisors gives your opponent more options.

## Command-Line Interaction Examples

**Game Start**

```
Current Number: 100
Player 1's Turn.
Enter a proper divisor of 100: 25
Player 1 divides 100 by 25.
New Current Number is 4.
```

**Next Turn**

```
Current Number: 4
Player 2's Turn.
Enter a proper divisor of 4: 2
Player 2 divides 4 by 2.
New Current Number is 2.
```

**Final Turn**

```
Current Number: 2
Player 1's Turn.
No proper divisors available.
Player 1 cannot make a move.
Player 2 wins the game!
```

## Conclusion

"Divisor Duel" is a strategic two-player game that combines basic division with tactical planning. By carefully selecting divisors, players can control the flow of the game and potentially force their opponent into a losing position. The simplicity of the rules makes it easy to code and play in a command-line interface, yet offers enough depth for skilled players to consistently outperform unskilled opponents.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
