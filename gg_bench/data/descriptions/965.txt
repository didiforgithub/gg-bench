# Sequence Builder

## Objective

Be the first player to reach the **target number** exactly by strategically adding or multiplying the **current number**. The player who successfully reaches the target number first **wins** the game.

## Setup

1. **Determine the Target Number**: Players agree on a target number to reach. The default target number is **23**, but any positive integer can be used to adjust the game's difficulty.

2. **Initialize the Current Number**: The game starts with the **current number** set to **1**.

3. **Player Assignment**: Decide which player goes first. This can be done by a coin toss, random selection, or mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: An integer that starts at 1 and changes as players take their turns.

- **Target Number**: The agreed-upon integer that players aim to reach exactly.

- **Operations**:
  - **Addition**: Players can add **1** or **2** to the current number.
  - **Multiplication**: Players can multiply the current number by **2**.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Display the Current Number**: The game shows the current number before each turn.
  2. **Choose an Operation**: On their turn, a player selects one of the allowed operations:
     - Add **1** to the current number.
     - Add **2** to the current number.
     - Multiply the current number by **2**.
  3. **Apply the Operation**: The chosen operation is applied, and the current number is updated.
  4. **Check for Victory**: If the current number equals the target number, the player wins.
  5. **Turn Ends**: If the target number is not reached, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Allowed Operations**:
   - **Addition**:
     - Players may add **1** or **2** to the current number.
   - **Multiplication**:
     - Players may multiply the current number by **2**.
2. **Staying Within Bounds**:
   - The current number **must not exceed** the target number after an operation.
   - If all possible operations would result in a number greater than the target number, the player **loses their turn**.
3. **Reaching the Target**:
   - The player who updates the current number to exactly match the target number **wins immediately**.
4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts an operation that would exceed the target number, they are prompted to choose a different operation.
   - Repeated invalid attempts result in **loss of turn**.
5. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player reaches the target number.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The player who reaches the target number exactly is declared the **winner**.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use points; victory is achieved by meeting the objective.
- **Match Play (Optional)**:
  - Players can play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

**Target Number**: 23  
**Current Number**: 1  
**Players**: Alice (Player 1) and Bob (Player 2)

#### Turn-by-Turn Play

1. **Turn 1 - Alice**
   - Current Number: 1
   - Alice chooses to add 2.
   - New Current Number: 3

2. **Turn 2 - Bob**
   - Current Number: 3
   - Bob chooses to multiply by 2.
   - New Current Number: 6

3. **Turn 3 - Alice**
   - Current Number: 6
   - Alice chooses to add 1.
   - New Current Number: 7

4. **Turn 4 - Bob**
   - Current Number: 7
   - Bob chooses to multiply by 2.
   - New Current Number: 14

5. **Turn 5 - Alice**
   - Current Number: 14
   - Alice chooses to add 2.
   - New Current Number: 16

6. **Turn 6 - Bob**
   - Current Number: 16
   - Bob wants to multiply by 2, but 16 * 2 = 32 exceeds the target number.
   - Bob chooses to add 1.
   - New Current Number: 17

7. **Turn 7 - Alice**
   - Current Number: 17
   - Alice chooses to add 2.
   - New Current Number: 19

8. **Turn 8 - Bob**
   - Current Number: 19
   - Bob chooses to add 2.
   - New Current Number: 21

9. **Turn 9 - Alice**
   - Current Number: 21
   - Alice cannot multiply by 2 (would be 42) or add 2 (would be 23, which is acceptable).
   - Alice chooses to add 2.
   - New Current Number: 23
   - Alice reaches the target number and **wins** the game.

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

Below is how a command-line version of the game might look during play.

```
Game Start!
Target Number: 23

Alice's Turn:
Current Number is 1
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Add 2
3. Multiply by 2
Enter choice (1-3): 2
You chose to add 2.
New Current Number is 3

Bob's Turn:
Current Number is 3
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Add 2
3. Multiply by 2
Enter choice (1-3): 3
You chose to multiply by 2.
New Current Number is 6

Alice's Turn:
Current Number is 6
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Add 2
3. Multiply by 2
Enter choice (1-3): 1
You chose to add 1.
New Current Number is 7

...

Alice's Turn:
Current Number is 21
Choose an operation:
1. Add 1
2. Add 2
3. Multiply by 2
Enter choice (1-3): 2
You chose to add 2.
New Current Number is 23

Congratulations, Alice! You have reached the target number and won the game!
```

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your operations to control the flow of the game.
- **Avoid Overshooting**: Be cautious with multiplication as it can quickly overshoot the target number.
- **Force the Win**: Try to set up the current number so that you can reach the target on your next turn, regardless of your opponent's moves.
- **Learn Optimal Paths**: Familiarize yourself with number sequences that lead to a win to enhance your chances against less skilled players.

## Conclusion

Sequence Builder is a simple yet strategic game that tests your arithmetic skills and foresight. With straightforward rules and quick gameplay, it offers an engaging experience that rewards planning and strategy.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
