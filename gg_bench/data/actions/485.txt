In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for Factor Duel, the action space is represented by discrete indices ranging from `0` to `starting_N` (inclusive). Each index corresponds to a potential divisor `D` that a player can choose to divide the current number `N`. However, only indices representing proper divisors (i.e., integers greater than `1` and less than `N` that divide `N` evenly) result in valid moves. Choosing an index corresponding to a non-proper divisor or an improper action results in an invalid move.
