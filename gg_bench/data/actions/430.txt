In the given gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(self.MAX_N + 1)`, representing actions from `0` to `MAX_N` inclusive. The action `0` corresponds to subtracting `1` from `N` when `N` is prime. Actions from `2` to `MAX_N` represent dividing `N` by the corresponding number, provided that number is a proper divisor of `N` (i.e., `N % action == 0`). Thus, actions map to moves by either subtracting `1` or dividing by a proper divisor, depending on the state of `N`.
