# Game Title: Dice Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to reach a score of **exactly 15** by strategically adding or subtracting dice rolls from your total. The game combines luck and strategy, allowing skilled players to outmaneuver their opponents.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players compete against each other.
- **Starting Scores**: Both players begin with a score of **0**.
- **Dice**: A simulated six-sided die will be used for rolling numbers between 1 and 6.

## Game Components

- **Scores**: Each player has an individual score starting at 0.
- **Die**: A six-sided die providing random numbers from 1 to 6.

## Turns

- Players take turns in sequence.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Roll the Die**: The current player rolls the die to generate a number between 1 and 6.
  2. **Choose Operation**: The player decides whether to **add** or **subtract** the rolled number from their current score.
  3. **Update Score**: The player's score is adjusted according to their choice.
  4. **Check for Win/Loss**: If the player's score reaches exactly 15, they win. If their score goes below 0 or exceeds 15, they lose.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Rolling the Die**:
   - On each turn, the player must roll the die once.
   - The die generates a random integer between 1 and 6 inclusive.

2. **Adding or Subtracting**:
   - After rolling, the player chooses to either **add** or **subtract** the rolled number to/from their current score.
   - Example: If the current score is 10 and the player rolls a 4, they can choose to have a new score of **14** (10 + 4) or **6** (10 - 4).

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to adjust their score to **exactly 15** wins the game immediately.

4. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's score becomes **negative** (below 0) or **exceeds 15** after their turn, they **lose** the game immediately.
   - If a player cannot make a move without their score going below 0 or above 15, they lose on their turn.

5. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players must make a move on their turn; passing is not allowed.
   - The only operations are addition and subtraction of the rolled number.

6. **No Draws**:
   - The game cannot end in a draw. Play continues until one player wins or loses according to the rules.

## Scoring

- **Score Tracking**:
  - Players maintain their own scores throughout the game.
  - Scores can range from 0 to 15 inclusive.

- **Winning Condition**:
  - Reach a score of **exactly 15**.

- **Losing Conditions**:
  - Score drops below **0**.
  - Score exceeds **15**.
  - Unable to make a valid move without causing the score to go below 0 or above 15.

#### Turn-by-Turn Play

   - **Options**: Add (0 + 5 = 5) or Subtract (0 - 5 = -5)

   - **Options**: Add (5 + 6 = 11) or Subtract (5 - 6 = -1)

   - **New Score**: 11
   - **Reasoning**: Subtracting would result in a negative score.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Rolls**: 4
   - **Options**: Add (3 + 4 = 7) or Subtract (3 - 4 = -1)
   - **Chooses**: Add
   - **New Score**: 7

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Rolls**: 4
   - **Options**: Add (11 + 4 = 15) or Subtract (11 - 4 = 7)
   - **Chooses**: Add
   - **New Score**: 15
   - **Outcome**: Player 1 wins by reaching exactly 15.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Avoiding Loss**: Players should be cautious when their score is close to 0 or 15 to avoid forced losses.
