The action space indices in the gym environment map directly to the numbers in the game by offsetting them by 2. Since the available numbers range from 2 to N, the action index of 0 corresponds to the number 2, the index of 1 corresponds to the number 3, and so on, up to an index of N-2 corresponding to the number N. Thus, an action index of `i` selects the number `i + 2` from the list of available numbers.
