In the Divisor Duel gym environment, the action space indices represent potential moves in the game by allowing the player to select any number from 0 to the maximum starting number (100). However, valid moves correspond to the proper divisors of the current shared number \( N \), which players can subtract from \( N \). Therefore, although the action space includes all numbers, only those indices that match the proper divisors of \( N \) at any given turn are legally valid moves. Invalid actions, i.e., those not representing a proper divisor, will result in a penalty.
