In the gym environment, the action space indices (0-8) correspond to selecting numbers (1-9) in the game. The mapping is straightforward: action index 0 maps to selecting the number 1, action index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8 mapping to the number 9. This creates a 1-to-1 correspondence between action indices and the available numbers in the game.
