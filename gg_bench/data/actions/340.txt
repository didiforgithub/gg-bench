In the provided gym environment for the Factor Duel game, the action space indices (ranging from 0 to max_number - 1) map directly to possible moves in the game by adding 1 to the index. This means that an action index of 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, an action index of 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on up to the maximum starting number, allowing players to choose factors of the Current Number.
