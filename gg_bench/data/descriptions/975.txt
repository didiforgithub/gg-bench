# Tower Siege: Rule Book

## Objective

**Tower Siege** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game played in a command-line interface. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach the opponent's tower located at position **10** on the linear battlefield. Players must navigate their hero across the battlefield while strategically managing their limited battle resources to overcome their opponent. Victory is achieved by reaching the opponent's tower, thus conquering it.

## Setup

- **Battlefield Layout**: A linear path consisting of positions numbered from **0** to **10**.
  - Position **0**: Each player's base.
  - Position **10**: The opponent's tower.
- **Player Heroes**: Each player controls a single hero token.
  - Player 1's hero starts at position **0** (Player 1's base).
  - Player 2's hero starts at the opposite position **0** (Player 2's base).
- **Battle Cards**: Each player has a set of battle cards numbered **1** to **5**.
  - These cards represent the hero's battle strength.
  - Each card can be used **once** before it must be restored.

## Game Components

### Battlefield

- **Positions**: Numbered from **0** to **10**.
  - Positions **1** to **9** are neutral ground.
  - Position **0** is each player's base; position **10** is the opponent's tower.

### Hero Tokens

- Represented by unique identifiers (e.g., **P1** for Player 1, **P2** for Player 2).
- Move along the battlefield positions according to game rules.

### Battle Cards

- **Cards**: Numbered **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, and **5**.
  - **Strength**: Higher number indicates greater strength.
- **Usage**:
  - Each card can be used **once**.
  - Cards are replenished when a player **rests** at their own base.

## Turns

- Players alternate turns; Player 1 starts the game.
- On their turn, a player must choose one of the following actions:
  1. **Move Forward**:
     - Move the hero forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
     - Movement is only **forward** toward the opponent's tower.
  2. **Rest**:
     - **Only at own base (position 0)**.
     - Resting restores all previously used battle cards.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Forward Movement**:
  - Players choose to move **1**, **2**, or **3** positions forward.
  - Cannot move beyond position **10**.
- **Occupying Positions**:
  - Both heroes can occupy the same position, triggering a **battle**.

### Battle Mechanics

- **Triggering a Battle**:
  - Occurs when a player moves their hero onto a position occupied by the opponent's hero.
- **Conducting a Battle**:
  1. **Card Selection**:
     - Both players secretly select one available battle card from their hand.
     - Cards are numbered **1** to **5**; each number represents the card's strength.
  2. **Reveal**:
     - Players simultaneously reveal their chosen cards.
  3. **Determine Outcome**:
     - **Higher Card Wins**:
       - The player who played the higher card wins the battle.
       - The losing player's hero is sent back to their own base (position **0**).
     - **Tie**:
       - If both players play cards of equal value, **both heroes** are sent back to their respective bases.
  4. **Card Usage**:
     - Used battle cards are **discarded** and cannot be used again until restored by resting.
- **Post-Battle Movement**:
  - The winning hero remains on the contested position.
  - Movement ends after a battle; a player cannot move further on the same turn.

### Resting

- **Conditions**:
  - A hero must be at their own base (position **0**) to rest.
- **Effect**:
  - Resting restores all used battle cards to the player's hand.
- **Turn Use**:
  - Resting consumes the player's entire turn.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**:
  - The first player to move their hero onto position **10** (the opponent's tower) **wins the game**.
  - The game ends immediately upon a player reaching the opponent's tower.
- **No Draws**:
  - The game cannot end in a draw; it continues until one player wins.
