The action space indices in the game correspond to positions on the 5x5 grid, mapped linearly. Index 0 represents the top-left cell (row 0, column 0) of the grid, and index 24 represents the bottom-right cell (row 4, column 4). Each subsequent index increases from left to right across each row and then moves down to the next row, effectively unraveling the 2D grid into a 1D array of size 25. This mapping allows a player's move to be represented by a single integer indicating the target cell's position on the grid.
