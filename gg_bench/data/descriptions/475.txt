# Word Ladder Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to transform the **Shared Word** into your **Secret Target Word** by changing one letter at a time, following the game rules. A player wins by successfully changing the Shared Word into their Secret Target Word using valid intermediate words.

## Setup

1. **Shared Word**: Both players agree on a starting word of a specified length (e.g., 4-letter word "COLD"). This word is used as the starting point for both players.

2. **Secret Target Words**:
   - Each player secretly chooses a target word of the same length as the Shared Word. The target word must be a valid English word.
   - Players should not reveal their target words to each other until the end of the game or when a victory condition is met.

3. **Dictionary**: A predefined list of valid English words of the specified length is agreed upon or loaded into the game for word validation during play.

## Game Components

- **Shared Word**: The current word in play, visible to both players.
- **Secret Target Words**: The words each player aims to transform the Shared Word into, kept secret from the opponent.
- **Dictionary**: A list of valid words used to verify the legality of moves.
- **Turns Indicator**: Keeps track of whose turn it is to play.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players interact with the game via text commands in the command line.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.

2. **Player Actions During a Turn**:
   - **Change a Letter**: The player modifies the Shared Word by changing exactly one letter to another letter, creating a new valid word.
   - **Pass**: If no valid moves are available, the player may pass their turn.

3. **Updating the Shared Word**: After a player makes a valid move, the Shared Word is updated to the new word.

4. **Turn Progression**: The game continues with players alternating turns until a victory condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - A player must change exactly one letter of the Shared Word on their turn.
   - The resulting word must be a valid English word found in the agreed-upon dictionary.
   - The new word must not be the same as the previous Shared Word.
   - A player cannot undo the opponent's last move by reverting the Shared Word to a word used previously in the game.

2. **Word Validity**:
   - Words must be of the same length as the Shared Word and Secret Target Words.
   - Proper nouns, abbreviations, and acronyms are not allowed unless agreed upon before the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins if, after their turn, the Shared Word is identical to their Secret Target Word.
   - If both players' Secret Target Words are the same, the first player to reach it wins.

4. **Stalemate and Passing**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move, they may pass their turn.
   - If both players pass consecutively, the game ends in a forfeit for the player who cannot progress towards their Secret Target Word, as per the no-draw condition.

5. **Game Integrity**:
   - Players must not reveal their Secret Target Word until a victory condition is claimed.
   - Cheating (e.g., changing more than one letter, using invalid words) results in an immediate loss.

## Example Gameplay

### Initial Setup

- **Shared Word**: `COLD`
- **Player 1's Secret Target Word**: `WARM`
- **Player 2's Secret Target Word**: `HEAT`

### Turn-by-Turn Example

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Change 'C' to 'C' (illegal, since it doesn't change a letter).
- **Revision**: Change 'C' to 'C' is invalid.
- **Action**: Change 'C' to 'C' is invalid.
- **Correct Action**: Change 'C' to 'C' is invalid.
- Actually, that seems not useful.

But we need to correct the example to properly reflect the rules.

Let's provide a correct example:

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action**: Change `COLD` to `CORD` by changing 'L' to 'R'.
- **Shared Word**: `CORD`

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action**: Change `CORD` to `CARD` by changing 'O' to 'A'.
- **Shared Word**: `CARD`

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action**: Change `CARD` to `WARD` by changing 'C' to 'W'.
- **Shared Word**: `WARD`

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action**: Change `WARD` to `WARS` by changing 'D' to 'S'.
- **Shared Word**: `WARS`

**Turn 5: Player 1**

- **Action**: Change `WARS` to `WARM` by changing 'S' to 'M'.
- **Shared Word**: `WARM`

- **Victory**: Player 1's Secret Target Word is `WARM`. Player 1 wins!

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Assuming a simple command-line interface where players input commands in the format:

```
Player [Number]> [Command]
```

Commands might include:

- `change [old_letter][position][new_letter]` (e.g., `change L3R` to change the third letter 'L' to 'R')
- `pass`

### Sample Interaction

```
Shared Word: COLD

Player 1> change L3R
Shared Word updated to: CORD

Player 2> change O2A
Shared Word updated to: CARD

Player 1> change C1W
Shared Word updated to: WARD

Player 2> change D4S
Shared Word updated to: WARS

Player 1> change S4M
Shared Word updated to: WARM
Player 1 declares victory with the word: WARM
```

## Strategic Considerations

- **Anticipate Opponent's Target**: Try to deduce the opponent's Secret Target Word based on their moves to block their progress.
- **Word Selection**: Choose target words that are not easily reached from common words or that require rare intermediate words.
- **Diversify Moves**: Avoid creating a path that the opponent can use to reach their target word.
- **Word Validity**: Keep a mental or written note of words used to ensure you do not revert to a previous word, violating the rules.

## Additional Rules for Complexity

To increase strategic depth, players may agree to:

- **Limited Vocabulary**: Use a more restricted dictionary (e.g., only words from a specific category).
- **Move Limits**: Set a maximum number of turns for the game.
- **Time Limits**: Implement a time limit per turn to add pressure and test quick thinking.

By adhering to these rules and mechanics, players can engage in a challenging duel of wits, vocabulary, and strategy in the Word Ladder Duel game.
