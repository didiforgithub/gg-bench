In the game, the action space is represented by indices ranging from `0` to `Nmax-1`, corresponding to the numbers `1` to `Nmax` in the pool. When a player selects an action `a` (where `a` is the index), it maps to the selection of the number `a + 1` from the pool. This is because the pool numbers are 1-indexed, while the action space is 0-indexed. Thus, the mapping is simple: action `0` corresponds to number `1`, action `1` to number `2`, and so on up to action `Nmax-1` corresponding to number `Nmax`.
