In this game, the action space consists of discrete numbers ranging from 0 to 8, corresponding to the available digits 1 to 9 in the game. The mapping is direct, where action space index `i` maps to the move of selecting the digit `i + 1`. For instance, an action space index of 0 represents selecting the digit 1, an index of 1 represents selecting the digit 2, and so forth, culminating with an action space index of 8 which corresponds to selecting the digit 9.
