**Game Name:** Number Flip Duel

---

### **Objective**

Outsmart your opponent by deducing their secret binary sequence before they deduce yours. Use logic and strategy to uncover your opponent's sequence through tactical moves and careful analysis. The first player to correctly guess the opponent's full sequence wins the game.

---

### **Setup**

- **Secret Sequence Creation:**
  - Each player privately generates a secret binary sequence consisting of **5 bits** (each bit is either a `0` or a `1`).
  - Example of a sequence: `1 0 1 1 0`.
- **Starting Conditions:**
  - Players do not share their sequences with each other.
  - Decide who takes the first turn (e.g., by coin toss or mutual agreement).
- **Game Tracking:**
  - Each player should have a way to record their own sequence changes and the feedback received from the opponent (pen and paper or a digital notepad).

---

### **Game Components**

- **Binary Sequences:**
  - Each player has their own secret sequence of 5 bits.
- **Turn Indicator:**
  - Keeps track of whose turn it is.
- **Action Options:**
  - Options to **Flip a Bit** or **Guess Opponent's Sequence** on each turn.
- **Feedback Mechanism:**
  - Players provide Match Counts after each Flip action.
- **Recording Sheets (optional but recommended):**
  - For tracking sequences, moves, and received feedback.

---

### **Turns**

- Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **On Your Turn, Choose One of the Following Actions:**
  1. **Flip a Bit:**
     - Modify your own sequence by flipping (changing) one bit at a specified position.
  2. **Guess Opponent's Sequence:**
     - Attempt to guess the opponent's entire secret sequence.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

#### **1. Flipping a Bit**

- **Procedure:**
  - Announce the action and specify the position (1 through 5) of the bit you are flipping in your own sequence.
  - Example: "Flip bit at position 3."
- **Update Your Sequence:**
  - Change the specified bit in your sequence from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.
- **Opponent's Response:**
  - After you flip a bit, the opponent must tell you the **Match Count**:
    - The number of bits that are the **same and in the same positions** in your sequence and their secret sequence.
    - **Note:** Do not reveal which bits match, only the total count.
  - Example Response: "Match Count is 2."

#### **2. Guessing the Opponent's Sequence**

- **Procedure:**
  - Announce that you are making a guess of the opponent's sequence.
  - State your full guess, specifying all 5 bits.
  - Example: "Guessing your sequence: 1 0 1 1 0."
- **Opponent's Response:**
  - **Correct Guess:**
    - If your guess exactly matches the opponent's secret sequence, they confirm, and you win the game.
    - Example: "Correct! You win."
  - **Incorrect Guess:**
    - If your guess does not match, the opponent simply states that it is incorrect.
    - **No further information is given.**
    - Example: "Incorrect guess."

#### **3. Providing Feedback**

- **Match Count Rules:**
  - Only provided after a Flip action.
  - Reflects the total number of matching bits in the same positions.
- **Honesty Is Mandatory:**
  - Players must provide accurate Match Counts.
  - The integrity of the game relies on truthful feedback.

#### **4. Game Progression**

- **Alternating Turns:**
  - After one player completes their action and receives feedback, it becomes the other player's turn.
- **Action Limitations:**
  - Only one action (Flip or Guess) is allowed per turn.
- **No Skipping Turns:**
  - Players must take an action on their turn.

#### **5. Winning the Game**

- **Victory Condition:**
  - The first player to correctly guess the opponent's full secret sequence wins.
- **No Draws:**
  - The game continues indefinitely until one player wins.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Win/Loss Outcome:**
  - The game results in a win for one player and a loss for the other.
- **Optional Extended Scoring:**
  - In multiple rounds, keep track of the number of turns taken to win.
  - The player with the fewest total turns over all rounds can be declared the overall winner.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

**Initial Secret Sequences (Hidden from Opponent):**

- **Player 1's Secret Sequence:** `1 0 1 1 0`
- **Player 2's Secret Sequence:** `0 1 0 1 1`

---

**Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Action:** Flip bit at position 3.
- **Player 1's New Sequence:** `1 0 0 1 0`
- **Player 2's Feedback:** "Match Count is 2."

**Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Action:** Flip bit at position 2.
- **Player 2's New Sequence:** `0 0 0 1 1`
- **Player 1's Feedback:** "Match Count is 3."

**Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Action:** Flip bit at position 5.
- **Player 1's New Sequence:** `1 0 0 1 1`
- **Player 2's Feedback:** "Match Count is 3."

**Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Action:** Guessing Player 1's sequence: `1 0 0 1 1`.
- **Player 1's Response:** "Correct! You win."
- **Result:** Player 2 wins the game.

#### **Example Command-Line Interaction**

```
Player 1: Flip bit at position 3.
Player 2: Match Count is 2.

Player 2: Flip bit at position 2.
Player 1: Match Count is 3.

Player 1: Flip bit at position 5.
Player 2: Match Count is 3.

Player 2: Guessing your sequence: 1 0 0 1 1.
Player 1: Correct! You win.
```

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Track Your Own Changes:**
  - Keep a record of your sequence after each flip to understand how Match Counts change in response.
- **Analyze Feedback:**
  - Use the changes in Match Counts to deduce which bits are matching.
- **Logical Deduction:**
  - Compare the feedback over multiple turns to narrow down possibilities.
- **Timing Your Guess:**
  - Make a guess when you have sufficient information; an incorrect guess wastes a turn without gaining new information.
- **Misleading Moves:**
  - Flipping certain bits might mislead your opponent about your sequence, adding a layer of strategy.

---

### **Notes**

- **Honesty and Integrity:**
  - Players must provide accurate and truthful feedback for the game to function properly.
- **Recording Information:**
  - Keeping detailed notes will greatly enhance strategic planning and deduction capabilities.
- **No Outside Assistance:**
  - Players should not use external help or devices to calculate possibilities beyond personal notes.
