The action space indices map to potential factor choices by representing factors starting from 2 up to the maximum factor. An index `i` in the action space corresponds to the factor `i + 2`, as the factors themselves start from 2 (the smallest proper factor) and go up to `max_factor`. This means if `action = 0`, the move corresponds to choosing the factor `2`, if `action = 1`, it corresponds to choosing the factor `3`, and so on. This mapping excludes non-proper factors like 1 and numbers greater than `max_factor`.
