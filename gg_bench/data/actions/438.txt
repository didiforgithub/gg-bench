The action space indices directly correspond to the proper divisors that a player can choose to subtract from the shared number N during their turn. Specifically, index `i` represents choosing the divisor `i` to subtract from N, where `i` ranges from 1 to N-1, allowing for the selection of any proper divisor of N. Only indices corresponding to valid proper divisors at the current state of the game are considered valid moves.
