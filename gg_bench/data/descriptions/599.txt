# Number Stack

## Objective

The primary goal of **Number Stack** is to be the first player to collect numbers that sum **exactly to 15**. Players take turns drawing numbers from a shared stack and strategically decide whether to keep or discard them to achieve the target sum. The game emphasizes strategic planning and foresight, ensuring that a skilled player can consistently outperform an unskilled opponent.

## Setup

1. **Number Stack**: Create a stack of numbers from **1 to 9**. Shuffle the numbers randomly to form the stack.
2. **Player Areas**: Each player has a personal collection area to keep their collected numbers.
3. **Starting Player**: Decide who goes first by any agreed method, such as a coin toss.
4. **Game Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input commands to draw, keep, or discard numbers.

## Game Components

1. **Number Stack**:
   - A shuffled stack containing the numbers **1** through **9**, each appearing once.
   - The numbers are hidden from view until drawn.

2. **Player Collections**:
   - Each player has an area to keep their collected numbers.
   - Numbers in a player's collection are visible to both players.

3. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Players interact with the game by typing commands to perform actions like drawing, keeping, or discarding numbers.

## Turns

- The game proceeds in alternating turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- On each turn, the active player performs the following actions:
  1. **Draw**: Draw the top number from the Number Stack.
  2. **Decision**: Choose to **keep** or **discard** the drawn number.
     - If kept, the number is added to the player's collection.
     - If discarded, the number is removed from play.
- After the action, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Drawing Numbers

- Players must draw the **top number** from the Number Stack on their turn.
- The drawn number is **revealed** to both players.

### Keeping or Discarding

- After drawing, the player must decide immediately whether to keep or discard the number.
- **Keeping**:
  - The number is added to the player's collection.
  - All collected numbers are visible to both players.
- **Discarding**:
  - The number is removed from the game permanently.
  - Discarded numbers cannot be used by either player.

### Collecting Numbers

- Players aim to collect numbers that sum exactly to **15**.
- Only the numbers in a player's own collection count toward their sum.
- Players can hold any number of collected numbers.

### Winning the Game

- The first player whose collected numbers sum exactly to **15** wins **immediately**.
- The sum can be made from any combination of the player's collected numbers.
- If the Number Stack is exhausted without a player reaching a sum of 15, the player with the **closest sum to 15 without exceeding it** wins the game.
- There is **no draw** mechanism; a winner will always emerge.

### Restrictions

- Numbers cannot be transferred between players.
- Once a number is discarded, it cannot be retrieved.
- Players must make their keep or discard decision **immediately** after drawing.

## Scoring

- **Winning Condition**: Achieve a sum of exactly **15** with collected numbers.
- **Alternate Winning Condition** (if the stack is exhausted):
  - The player with the sum **closest to 15 without exceeding it** wins.
- **No Point System**: The game does not use points; victory is determined by the collected sums.
