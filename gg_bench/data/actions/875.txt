In the `CustomEnv` Gym environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(100)`, which means the actions range from `0` to `99`. Each action index corresponds directly to choosing a number between `1` and `100` by using the formula `chosen_number = action + 1`. For example, an action index of `0` maps to the number `1`, an action index of `1` maps to the number `2`, and so on, until action index `99`, which maps to the number `100`. This provides a direct linear mapping from the action indices to the numbers available in the game.
