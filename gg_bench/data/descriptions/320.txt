# Power Duel: Rule Book

## Objective

**Power Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where the primary goal is to reduce your opponent's Power Level to zero. Players must decide between charging their Attack Power or unleashing an attack on their opponent. The first player to decrease their opponent's Power Level to zero wins the game.

## Setup

- **Initial Power Levels**: Both players start with a **Power Level** of **10**.
- **Initial Attack Power**: Both players begin with an **Attack Power** of **1**.
- **Turn Order**: Decide randomly or mutually agree on which player takes the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Power Level**: Represents a player's health. Starts at 10 for each player.
- **Attack Power**: Determines the amount of damage a player can deal when attacking. Starts at 1 and increases when charging.
- **Actions**: On each turn, players choose one of two actions:
  - **Charge** (`C`): Increases your Attack Power by 1.
  - **Attack** (`A`): Deals damage equal to your current Attack Power to your opponent and resets your Attack Power to 1.

## Turns

- Players take turns performing actions.

## Strategy Tips

- **Balancing Charge and Attack**: Continuously charging increases your Attack Power, but leaves you vulnerable to attacks. Find the right moment to strike.
- **Predicting Opponent's Moves**: Anticipate whether your opponent will charge or attack to inform your own decisions.
- **Pressuring the Opponent**: Early attacks can pressure your opponent, forcing them to reset their Attack Power and potentially disrupting their strategy.
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Charging multiple times can lead to a powerful attack but comes with the risk of being attacked while defenseless.

Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!
