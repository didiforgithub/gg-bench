     - Only one swap per turn is allowed.
- **Adjacency Rules**:

  - Diagonal cells are **not** considered adjacent.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Placing Markers**:
   - A marker can be placed in any empty cell.
   - Once placed, a marker remains unless it is swapped by the opponent.

2. **Swapping Markers**:
   - After placing a marker, you may swap one **adjacent opponent's marker**.
   - Replace the opponent's marker with your own in that cell.
   - Swapping is **optional** and can only occur **immediately** after placing your marker.

3. **End of Game Conditions**:
   - The game ends when all 9 cells are filled.
   - **Victory**: The player with **more markers** on the grid wins.
   - **Tie-Breaker**: In case of an equal number of markers:
     - The **player who did not take the last turn** wins.
     - This rule ensures that there is **no draw**.

---

### **Scoring**

- **No cumulative score** is kept.
- **Winner Determination**:
  - Simply count the number of markers for each player at the end of the game.
  - The player with the higher count wins.

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Early Control**: Occupying the center cell early can increase swapping opportunities.
- **Defensive Play**: Be cautious when placing markers adjacent to your opponent's markers to avoid immediate swaps.
- **Swap Wisely**: Use the swap option to reclaim key positions and disrupt your opponent's plans.
- **Think Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves to maintain the majority.

---

### **Additional Rules**

- **Invalid Moves**:
  - If a player selects an occupied cell, they must choose again.
  - If a player attempts to swap a non-adjacent marker, the swap is not allowed.
- **Enforcement**:
  - The game should validate moves and swaps to ensure compliance with the rules.
  - Invalid inputs prompt the player to retry.

### **Game End and Winning**

- **Majority Rule**:
  - After the last cell is filled, count each player's markers.
  - **Winner**: The player with more markers.
- **Tie-Breaker Rule**:
  - If both players have 4 markers each, the player who **did not** place the last marker wins.
  - This ensures there is always a clear winner.
