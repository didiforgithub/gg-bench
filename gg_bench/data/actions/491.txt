In the custom gym environment for the game "Adjacent Eliminator," the action space is represented by indices corresponding to the positions of numbers in the sequence. Each index in the action space directly maps to a number in the sequence that a player can select for removal. When a player takes an action by selecting an index, the number at that position and its adjacent numbers are removed from the sequence, implementing the game's rule of removing a number and its neighboring numbers.
