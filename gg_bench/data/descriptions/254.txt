# Number Maze

## Rule Book

### Objective

The **primary goal** of **Number Maze** is to be the **first player to reach the target number exactly**. Players achieve victory by applying strategic mathematical operations to their current number, aiming to reach the target number before their opponent. 

- **Win Condition:** A player wins by adjusting their current number to exactly match the target number on their turn.
- **Loss Condition:** If a player's operation causes their current number to exceed the target number, they immediately lose the game.

### Setup

1. **Select Target Number:**
   - Decide on a target number that both players will aim to reach.
   - The **default target number is 100**, but players can agree on any positive integer greater than 1 to vary the game's difficulty and length.

2. **Starting Number:**
   - Both players begin the game with a **starting number of 1**.

3. **Determine Player Order:**
   - Decide who will take the first turn.
   - This can be determined randomly (e.g., coin toss) or by mutual agreement.

4. **Prepare Tracking Tools (Optional):**
   - While not necessary, players may use paper, a calculator, or a command-line interface to keep track of numbers and operations.

### Game Components

- **Current Number:**
  - Each player has their own current number, starting at 1.
  - This number changes based on the operations performed during the game.

- **Operations:**
  - **Add 1:** Increase the current number by 1.
  - **Multiply by 2:** Double the current number.

- **No Physical Components Required:**
  - All calculations and operations are performed mentally or tracked digitally/with paper.
  - Ideal for a command-line interface or simple program.

### Turns

- **Turn Order:**
  - Players take turns alternately throughout the game.
  
- **Structure of a Turn:**
  1. **Operation Selection:**
     - The player chooses one of the two available operations:
       - **Option 1:** Add 1
       - **Option 2:** Multiply by 2
  2. **Perform Operation:**
     - Apply the chosen operation to the current number.
  3. **Update Current Number:**
     - The player's current number is updated to reflect the operation.
  4. **Check for Win/Loss Conditions:**
     - If the current number **exactly equals** the target number, the player wins.
     - If the current number **exceeds** the target number, the player loses.
  5. **Pass Turn:**
     - The turn passes to the other player.

### Rules and Mechanics

1. **Available Operations:**
   - **Add 1:**
     - **Effect:** Increases the current number by 1.
     - **Example:** If the current number is 5, after adding 1, it becomes 6.
   - **Multiply by 2:**
     - **Effect:** Multiplies the current number by 2.
     - **Example:** If the current number is 5, after multiplying by 2, it becomes 10.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player **wins immediately** if their current number equals the target number after their operation.
   - The game ends upon a win; no further turns are played.

3. **Losing the Game:**
   - A player **loses immediately** if their current number exceeds the target number after their operation.
   - The game ends upon a loss; no further turns are played.

4. **No Draws:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw.
   - Each game will result in a win for one player and a loss for the other.

5. **Valid Moves:**
   - Players must choose an operation that results in a current number within the range of 1 to the target number.
   - There are no skips or passes; a player must perform one of the two operations on their turn.

6. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Players should plan ahead to avoid overshooting the target number.
   - Anticipating the opponent's possible moves can provide a strategic advantage.

### Scoring

- **Single Round Wins:**
  - Each game is a single round where the outcome is a win or loss.
  - The player who reaches the target number first is declared the winner of that round.

- **Match Play (Optional):**
  - Players can agree to play multiple rounds.
  - **Scoring System:** One point per win.
  - **Winning the Match:** The first player to reach a predetermined number of points (e.g., best of 5 games) wins the match.

- **Tie-Breaker:**
  - Since there are no draws, tie-breakers are unnecessary.

  - Consider the possible outcomes of both operations before making a move.

- **Watch Your Opponent:**
  - Pay attention to your opponent's current number.
  - Try to anticipate their next move and adjust your strategy accordingly.

- **Avoid Overshooting:**
  - As you approach the target number, choose operations that keep you within safe range.
  - Be cautious with multiplication when your current number is close to half of the target number.

- **Force Errors:**
  - Try to set up situations where your opponent has no safe moves and will be forced to exceed the target number on their turn.

### Variations

1. **Different Target Numbers:**
   - Change the target number to make the game shorter or longer.
   - Example: Target number of 50 for a shorter game.

2. **Additional Operations:**
   - Introduce new operations to increase complexity.
     - **Subtract 1:** Allow players to decrease their number by 1.
     - **Divide by 2:** Allow division if the current number is even.

3. **Limit Operation Use:**
   - Restrict the number of times an operation can be used.
   - Example: Each player can only multiply by 2 a maximum of 5 times.

4. **Time Constraints:**
   - Implement a time limit per turn to increase pressure and excitement.
