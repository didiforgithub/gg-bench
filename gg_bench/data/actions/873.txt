The action space of the Lockdown game is mapped into 33 discrete actions:

1. **Actions 0-8:** Represent the placement of a blocker in cells 1 to 9, respectively. These actions are usable if the cell is empty and meets the placement rules (adjacent to player's base or existing blocker).

2. **Actions 9-32:** Correspond to movements of a player's blocker from one cell to an adjacent cell. Each action index maps to a specific move defined between pairs of orthogonally adjacent cells. For example, action 9 represents moving a blocker from cell 1 to cell 2. These moves are valid if the target cell is empty and within the adjacency constraints.
