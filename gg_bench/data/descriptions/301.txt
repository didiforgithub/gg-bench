### **Objective**

Energy Duel is a two-player turn-based strategy game where each player aims to reduce their opponent's energy points (EP) from **10** to **0**. The primary goal is to outmaneuver your opponent through a series of actions that manage and deplete energy resources. A player wins the game by bringing their opponent's EP to zero or below while maintaining at least one EP themselves.

### **Strategic Depth**

- **Energy Management:**
  - Balancing when to Charge to gain EP versus when to Blast to deal damage is crucial.
- **Predicting Opponent's Moves:**
  - Anticipate if the opponent will Shield, allowing you to avoid wasting a Blast.
- **Action Restrictions:**
  - Utilize the knowledge that a Shielding player cannot Charge next turn to plan your strategy.
- **Risk vs. Reward:**
  - Blasting drains your own EP; consider if the potential damage is worth the cost.
