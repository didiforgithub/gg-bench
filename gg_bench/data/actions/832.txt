In the environment, the action space is represented as `spaces.Discrete(self.N_max + 1)`, which allows actions from 0 to `N_max` (0 to 100 by default). Each action index corresponds directly to a number that a player could choose to subtract from `N`, provided it is a valid proper divisor of `N`. A valid move requires the action to be a proper divisor of `N`; otherwise, it results in an invalid move, ending the game. Thus, the action space index represents the divisor a player selects and attempts to subtract from the current number `N`.
