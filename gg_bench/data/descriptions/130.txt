# Dual Jump

## Objective

Be the first player to reach or pass the finish line at position **10** on the track. Strategically advance along the track while potentially hindering your opponent's progress by sending them back to the start.

---

## Setup

- **Track Positions**: A linear track represented by positions numbered from **0** (start) to **10** (finish).
- **Player Markers**: Each player has a marker indicating their current position on the track.
  - **Player 1**'s marker: `P1`
  - **Player 2**'s marker: `P2`
- **Starting Positions**: Both players begin at position **0**.
- **First Turn**: Decide which player will go first (e.g., by coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Track**: A sequence of positions from 0 to 10.
- **Markers**: Representations of each player's current position.
  - In a command-line interface, the track can be displayed as numbers with player markers shown next to their respective positions.
- **Move Options**: Players can choose to move forward by 1, 2, or 3 positions on their turn.

---

## Turns

Players take turns alternately throughout the game. Each turn consists of the following steps:

1. **Choose Move Distance**: On your turn, select a move distance of **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
2. **Move Marker**: Advance your marker forward along the track by the chosen distance.
3. **Check for Collision**:
   - If you land on the same position as your opponent, you **"bump"** them back to the starting position (**0**).
4. **Check for Victory**:
   - If your new position is **10** or beyond, you win the game.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Movement Rules

- **Valid Moves**: On each turn, you must move forward by **1**, **2**, or **3** positions.
- **Forward Movement**: All movement is forward; you cannot move backward.
- **No Skipping Turns**: You must move on your turn; passing is not allowed.

### Collision Mechanics

- **Bumping Opponent**:
  - If, after moving, you land exactly on your opponent's current position, you **bump** them back to the starting position (**0**).
  - The opponent will resume play from position **0** on their next turn.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: The first player to reach or pass position **10** wins the game.
- **Simultaneous Victory**: If both players reach or pass **10** on the same turn, the player who moved first is declared the winner.
- **Exact Finish Not Required**: You do not need to land exactly on position **10**; passing it is sufficient to win.

### Game Progression

- **Continuous Play**: The game continues with players alternating turns until one player wins.
- **No Draw**: There is no mechanism for a draw; the game continues until a winner is determined.

---

## Scoring

- **No Score Tracking**: Points are not accumulated during the game.
- **Win/Loss Outcome**: The game results in a win for one player and a loss for the other based on who reaches the finish line first.

## Strategy Tips

- **Balancing Advancement and Defense**: Decide whether to advance rapidly toward the finish or to position yourself to bump your opponent.
- **Predicting Opponent's Moves**: Anticipate where your opponent might land to avoid being bumped.
- **Managing Risk**: Sometimes moving fewer positions can prevent your opponent from bumping you on their next turn.

---

This game combines simplicity with strategic depth, making it easy to learn but challenging to master. Players must make tactical decisions each turn, weighing the benefits of rapid advancement against the risk of being bumped back to the start.
