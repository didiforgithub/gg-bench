# Multiplication Showdown

## Objective

Multiplication Showdown is a two-player, turn-based game. The primary goal is to force your opponent to be the first to reach or exceed the target number, which results in their loss. Players take turns multiplying a running total by a chosen number within a specified range. Strategic thinking and foresight are key to victory.

## Setup

- **Initial Total**: The game starts with a total of **1**.
- **Target Number**: The target number is set to **1,000**.
- **Players**: Two players participate, designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
  
There are no physical components to set up, making it perfect for a command-line interface.

## Game Components

- **Running Total**: A numeric value that starts at **1** and is updated each turn.
- **Multipliers**: Integers ranging from **2** to **9**. Players choose from these numbers to modify the running total.
  
No boards, cards, or tokens are required.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with **Player 1**.
- **Player Action**:
  - On their turn, a player selects a multiplier (an integer from **2** to **9**).
  - The running total is then multiplied by the chosen multiplier.
- **Progression**: The updated total is displayed, and the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Choosing Multipliers**:
   - Players must select an integer between **2** and **9**, inclusive.
   - Only integers within this range are valid; decimals or numbers outside the range are not allowed.

2. **Updating the Total**:
   - The running total is updated by multiplying it by the chosen multiplier.
   - Example: If the current total is **5** and the player chooses **3**, the new total is **15**.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player's move causes the running total to reach or exceed **1,000**, that player **loses** the game.
   - The opponent is declared the **winner**.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player inputs an invalid multiplier (not an integer between **2** and **9**), they are prompted again.
   - The running total remains unchanged until a valid move is made.

5. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Players must plan ahead to avoid being forced into reaching or exceeding the target number.
   - Understanding multiplication and anticipating the opponent's options is crucial.

## Scoring

- **Victory Condition**: The opponent reaches or exceeds the target number (**1,000**) on their turn.
- **No Points System**: There is no point tracking beyond determining the winner and loser of each game.
- **Match Play**: Players can agree to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial State**:
- Running Total: **1**
- Target Number: **1,000**

**Player 1's Turn**:
- Chooses multiplier **5**.
- New total: \(1 \times 5 = 5\).

**Player 2's Turn**:
- Chooses multiplier **9**.
- New total: \(5 \times 9 = 45\).

**Player 1's Turn**:
- Chooses multiplier **2**.
- New total: \(45 \times 2 = 90\).

**Player 2's Turn**:
- Chooses multiplier **9**.
- New total: \(90 \times 9 = 810\).

**Player 1's Turn**:
- Can only choose multipliers from 2 to 9.
- All choices will result in a total equal to or exceeding 1,620 (since \(810 \times 2 = 1,620\)), surpassing the target.
- Player 1 must choose a multiplier.
- Chooses **2**, resulting in \(810 \times 2 = 1,620\).
- Running total is **1,620**, which exceeds **1,000**.

**Result**:
- **Player 1** exceeds the target number.
- **Player 2** wins the game.

### Command-Line Interaction

Below is a sample of how the game might look in a command-line interface.

```
Welcome to Multiplication Showdown!
Target Number: 1,000

Starting with 1.

Player 1's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 5
Running Total is now: 5

Player 2's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 9
Running Total is now: 45

Player 1's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 2
Running Total is now: 90

Player 2's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 9
Running Total is now: 810

Player 1's turn.
Enter a multiplier (2-9): 2
Running Total is now: 1620

Total has reached or exceeded 1,000!
Player 1 loses.
Player 2 wins!
```

## Conclusion

Multiplication Showdown is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and make optimal choices each turn. With easy-to-understand rules and minimal components, it's perfect for quick matches and can be easily implemented in a command-line environment.
