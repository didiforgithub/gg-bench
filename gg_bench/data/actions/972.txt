In the Chain Reaction game environment, the action space indices range from 0 to 19, each corresponding directly to the numbers 1 to 20 in the number pool. Specifically, an action space index `i` represents selecting the number `i+1` from the pool. This mapping allows players to pick numbers by referencing the respective index, ensuring a straightforward mechanism for choosing available numbers during the game.
