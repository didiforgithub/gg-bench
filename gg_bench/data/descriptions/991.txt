# Unlucky Multiples

## Objective

Unlucky Multiples is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players race to reach a target total without making the running total a multiple of a forbidden number. The primary goal is to be the first player to reach **exactly 25** without causing the running total to become a multiple of **5** during your turn. A player loses if they either make the running total a multiple of 5 after their move or cannot make a valid move without doing so.

## Setup

1. **Starting Total**: The game begins with a running total of **0**.
2. **Target Total**: Players aim to reach a total of **25**.
3. **Forbidden Multiple**: Avoid making the running total a multiple of **5**.
4. **Number Pool**: Each player has a hand of numbers from **1** to **9**, inclusive.

## Game Components

- **Running Total**: A shared cumulative total that starts at 0 and increases as players add numbers.
- **Player Hands**: Each player has a set of number tokens from **1** to **9**. These represent the numbers they can add to the running total.
  - **Number Tokens**: The numbers **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9** (excluding **5** to reinforce the forbidden multiple theme).
- **Forbidden Multiple**: The number **5**, which players must avoid creating multiples of in the running total.

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss). Turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
2. **Player Actions**:
   - **Select a Number**: On your turn, choose a number from your available number tokens.
   - **Add to Total**: Add the chosen number to the running total.
3. **Restrictions**:
   - **Valid Moves**: The chosen number must not cause the running total to become a multiple of **5**.
   - **Unique Usage**: Once a number token is used, it is removed from the player's hand and cannot be used again.
4. **Turn Progression**: After a valid move, the turn passes to the other player.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Making a Move**:
  - Players must select a number from their hand that does not result in the running total being a multiple of 5.
  - If all remaining numbers in a player's hand would result in a multiple of 5 when added to the running total, the player loses.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - **Victory Condition**: The first player to reach **exactly 25** without making the running total a multiple of 5 wins the game.
  - **Forcing a Loss**: If a player adds a number that makes the running total a multiple of 5, they immediately lose.
- **Forbidden Moves**:
  - Players cannot skip a turn.
  - Players must make a move if they have at least one valid number token available.
- **Example of Forbidden Totals**: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 (running totals that are multiples of 5 during gameplay, except the final target total).

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: Victory is achieved by either reaching exactly 25 first or by the opponent making a forbidden move.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw due to the structure of the rules and the forbidden multiple mechanic.

## Examples

### Example Scenario 1

**Starting State**:
- Running Total: 0
- Player 1 Hand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Player 2 Hand: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

**Turn 1**:
- **Player 1** chooses **2**.
- Running Total: 0 + 2 = **2** (valid move).
- Player 1 Hand: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

**Turn 2**:
- **Player 2** chooses **3**.
- Running Total: 2 + 3 = **5** (invalid move; 5 is a multiple of 5).
- **Player 2 loses**.

**Result**: Player 1 wins.

### Example Scenario 2

**Starting State**:
- Running Total: 0

**Turns**:

1. **Player 1** selects **4**.
   - Total: 0 + 4 = **4**
2. **Player 2** selects **1**.
   - Total: 4 + 1 = **5** (Player 2 loses; total is a multiple of 5).

**Result**: Player 1 wins.

### Example Scenario 3 (Extended Gameplay)

**Starting State**:
- Running Total: 0

**Turns**:

1. **Player 1** selects **1**.
   - Total: 0 + 1 = **1**
2. **Player 2** selects **2**.
   - Total: 1 + 2 = **3**
3. **Player 1** selects **4**.
   - Total: 3 + 4 = **7**
4. **Player 2** selects **3**.
   - Total: 7 + 3 = **10** (Player 2 loses; total is a multiple of 5).

**Result**: Player 1 wins.

### Example Scenario 4 (Reaching the Target Total)

**Starting State**:
- Running Total: 22
- Player 1 Hand: 3
- Player 2 Hand: 2

**Turn**:

- **Player 1** must decide whether adding **3** (22 + 3 = **25**) is valid.
  - Since 25 is the **target total**, Player 1 wins if the move doesn't make the total a forbidden multiple during gameplay.
  - **However**, 25 is a multiple of 5, but reaching 25 exactly is the victory condition.
  - **Conclusion**: Player 1 wins by reaching the target total of **25**.

**Result**: Player 1 wins.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

Below is a sample interaction between two players using a command-line interface.

**Game Start**

- Running Total: 0

**Player 1's Turn**

- Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- `Player 1, choose a number to add: 6`
- Running Total: 0 + 6 = **6** (Valid)

**Player 2's Turn**

- Available Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- `Player 2, choose a number to add: 4`
- Running Total: 6 + 4 = **10** (Invalid â€“ multiple of 5)
- `Total is 10, which is a multiple of 5. Player 2 loses.`

**Game Over**

- **Winner**: Player 1

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves based on the numbers they've already played.
- **Control the Total**: Aim to leave the running total at numbers that limit your opponent's safe options.
- **Number Management**: Preserve crucial numbers that can help you reach 25 without creating a multiple of 5.

## Summary

By carefully selecting which numbers to play and when to play them, skilled players can control the flow of the game and outmaneuver their opponents.
