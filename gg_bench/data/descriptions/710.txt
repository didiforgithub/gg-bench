# Divisor Duel: A Two-Player Strategy Game

## Objective

Divisor Duel is a turn-based strategy game for two players. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move. This occurs when the shared number **N** becomes **1** or a prime number with no proper divisors other than **1** and itself. The player who makes the last valid move wins the game.

---

## Setup

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive integer **N**. By default, **N = 100**, but players can agree on any other composite number greater than **1** to start the game.
- **Players**: Two players are required. Decide who will take the first turn (Player 1) and who will take the second turn (Player 2).

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number (N)**: This is the central element of the game. It changes with each turn based on players' actions.
- **Proper Divisors**: Numbers greater than **1** and less than **N** that divide **N** without leaving a remainder. Proper divisors are used to reduce **N** during the game.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played through textual inputs and outputs, suitable for a command-line environment.

---

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Turn Actions**:
  1. **Display Current N**: The current value of **N** is displayed.
  2. **List Proper Divisors**: Display all proper divisors of **N** greater than **1**.
  3. **Player's Choice**: The current player selects a proper divisor from the list.
  4. **Update N**: **N** is divided by the chosen divisor, and the result becomes the new **N**.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Valid Moves**:
   - On your turn, you must choose a proper divisor of **N** that is greater than **1** and less than **N**.
   - **1** and **N** are not valid choices since **1** is not a proper divisor, and dividing by **N** would always result in **1**.

2. **Dividing N**:
   - **N** is updated by dividing it by the chosen proper divisor:
     \[
     N_{\text{new}} = \frac{N_{\text{current}}}{\text{Chosen Proper Divisor}}
     \]
   - The resulting **N** must be an integer.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - If a player reduces **N** to **1** or a prime number with no proper divisors greater than **1**, their opponent cannot make a valid move and thus loses.
   - The player who makes the last valid move wins the game.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot find a proper divisor on their turn, they lose.
   - Selecting a number that is not a proper divisor of **N** is not allowed.

5. **Game End**:
   - The game ends when a player wins according to the winning conditions.
   - There are no draws or ties in Divisor Duel.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The winner is the player who successfully forces their opponent into a position with no valid moves.
- **No Point System**: The game does not track points; victory is determined solely by the win condition.
- **Match Play**: Players may choose to play multiple rounds, keeping track of wins to determine an overall champion.

## Examples

### Example Game

**Starting N = 100**

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 100
   - **Proper Divisors of 100**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
   - **Player 1 Chooses**: 2
   - **New N**: 100 รท 2 = 50

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 50
   - **Proper Divisors of 50**: 2, 5, 10, 25
   - **Player 2 Chooses**: 5
   - **New N**: 50 รท 5 = 10

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 10
   - **Proper Divisors of 10**: 2, 5
   - **Player 1 Chooses**: 2
   - **New N**: 10 รท 2 = 5

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - **Current N**: 5
   - **Proper Divisors of 5**: None (5 is prime)
   - **Player 2 Cannot Move**: No valid proper divisors
   - **Player 1 Wins**

### Command-Line Interaction Sample

**Game Start**

```plaintext
Starting the Divisor Duel!
Initial N is 100.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 100
Proper Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
Choose a proper divisor: 2
You chose 2. N is now 50.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 50
Proper Divisors: 2, 5, 10, 25
Choose a proper divisor: 5
You chose 5. N is now 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Current N: 10
Proper Divisors: 2, 5
Choose a proper divisor: 2
You chose 2. N is now 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Current N: 5
Proper Divisors: None
No valid moves left. Player 1 wins!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice will affect the available divisors on your opponent's turn.
- **Prime Numbers**: Aim to reduce **N** to a prime number on your opponent's turn, leaving them with no valid moves.
- **Avoid Reducing to 1 on Your Turn**: Ensure that when you divide **N**, you do not leave **N** as **1** on your turn, or you'll lose if it's your turn and no valid moves remain.

---

## Additional Rules (Optional Variants)

- **Alternate Starting N**: Players can agree to start with a different composite number to increase or decrease game length and complexity.
- **Timed Turns**: Introduce a time limit for each turn to add pressure and excitement.
- **Best of Series**: Play multiple rounds, and the player who wins the majority is the overall winner.
