# Number Stack Attack Rule Book

## Objective

**Number Stack Attack** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game where players compete to be the first to reach a stack total of exactly **21** without exceeding it. Players take turns adding numbered tokens to their personal stack, planning their moves carefully to achieve the target total while preventing their opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

1. **Game Start**: Determine which player goes first (Player 1 and Player 2). This can be decided randomly or by mutual agreement.
2. **Stacks**: Each player begins with an empty stack.
3. **Number Tokens**: A shared pool of number tokens ranging from **1** to **9** is available. Each number token is available in unlimited quantity, so players do not need to worry about depleting a particular number.

## Game Components

- **Number Tokens (1-9)**:
  - Each token displays a number from **1** to **9**.
  - Tokens are identical except for their numeric value.
  - Tokens have no special attributes beyond their number.

- **Player Stacks**:
  - Each player has their own stack where they place number tokens during the game.
  - The stack total is the sum of all numbers in the player's stack.

- **Command-Line Interface**:
  - Players interact with the game via text inputs and outputs in the command-line interface.
  - The interface displays the current stack totals, available numbers, and prompts for player actions.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
- **Player Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must select one number token from **1** to **9** and add it to their stack.
  - Players input their chosen number via the command-line interface.
- **Turn Progression**:
  - After a player adds a number to their stack, the turn passes to the other player.
  - The game continues until a win condition is met.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Adding Numbers**:
   - Players can choose any number from **1** to **9** on their turn.
   - Numbers are not depleted; each number can be chosen multiple times by both players.

2. **Stack Total**:
   - A player's stack total is the sum of all numbers in their stack.
   - Players must ensure their stack total does not exceed **21**.
   - If adding a number would cause the stack total to exceed **21**, the player must skip their turn.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - **Exact Total Victory**: The first player to reach a stack total of exactly **21** wins the game.
   - **Stand Off Victory**:
     - If both players are unable to make a move without exceeding **21**, the player with the stack total closest to **21** wins.
     - If both players have the same total, the player who reached that total first wins.

4. **Forced Pass**:
   - If a player cannot add any number without exceeding **21**, they must pass their turn.
   - The opposing player continues to take turns if they can make legal moves.

### Strategic Considerations

- **Planning Ahead**:
  - Players should anticipate how their number selections affect future turns.
  - Consideration of both players' stack totals is crucial.

- **Defensive Play**:
  - Players can choose numbers that limit the opponent's options on their next turn.
  - For example, leaving the opponent with only numbers that would cause them to exceed **21**.

- **Risk Management**:
  - Balancing the desire to reach **21** quickly against the risk of limiting one's own future options is key.

## Scoring

- **No Point System**:
  - The game does not use a point system.
  - Victory is achieved by meeting the win conditions outlined above.

- **Victory Conditions**:
  - **Primary Victory**: Reaching a stack total of exactly **21**.
  - **Secondary Victory**: Having the highest stack total below **21** when both players cannot make a legal move.

## Examples

### Example Scenario

**Initial State**:
- Player 1 Stack Total: 0
- Player 2 Stack Total: 0
- Available Numbers: 1-9 (unlimited supply)

---

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:
- Chooses number **9**.
- Player 1 Stack Total: 9

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 1 Turn:
Your current stack total is 0.
Enter a number between 1 and 9 to add to your stack: 9
You added 9 to your stack.
Your new stack total is 9.
```

---

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:
- Chooses number **8**.
- Player 2 Stack Total: 8

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 2 Turn:
Your current stack total is 0.
Enter a number between 1 and 9 to add to your stack: 8
You added 8 to your stack.
Your new stack total is 8.
```

---

**Turn 3 - Player 1**:
- Chooses number **7**.
- Player 1 Stack Total: 16 (9 + 7)

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 1 Turn:
Your current stack total is 9.
Enter a number between 1 and 9 to add to your stack: 7
You added 7 to your stack.
Your new stack total is 16.
```

---

**Turn 4 - Player 2**:
- Chooses number **9**.
- Player 2 Stack Total: 17 (8 + 9)

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 2 Turn:
Your current stack total is 8.
Enter a number between 1 and 9 to add to your stack: 9
You added 9 to your stack.
Your new stack total is 17.
```

---

**Turn 5 - Player 1**:
- Must choose a number that does not cause the stack total to exceed **21**.
- Options are numbers **1** to **5** (since 16 + 6 = 22).
- Chooses number **5**.
- Player 1 Stack Total: 21 (16 + 5)
- Player 1 wins by reaching **21** exactly.

**Command-Line Interaction**:
```
Player 1 Turn:
Your current stack total is 16.
Enter a number between 1 and 5 to add to your stack: 5
You added 5 to your stack.
Your new stack total is 21.
Congratulations, you have reached 21 and won the game!
```

---

**Game End**:
- Player 1 wins.
- Player 2 had a stack total of 17.

## Additional Examples

### Scenario Where Both Players Must Pass

**Late Game State**:
- Player 1 Stack Total: 19
- Player 2 Stack Total: 18

**Player 1 Turn**:
- Cannot add numbers **1** to **9** without exceeding **21**.
- Must pass.

**Player 2 Turn**:
- Only number **1** can be added without exceeding **21** (18 + 1 = 19).
- Chooses number **1**.
- Player 2 Stack Total: 19

**Player 1 Turn**:
- Stack Total: 19
- Cannot add any number without exceeding **21**.
- Must pass.

**Player 2 Turn**:
- Stack Total: 19
- Cannot add any number without exceeding **21**.
- Must pass.

**Result**:
- Both players cannot make a move.
- Both players have a stack total of **19**.
- Player 2 wins because they reached **19** after Player 1, and in the case of a tie, the player who achieved the highest total first loses.

## Strategies

- **Monitor Both Stacks**: Keep track of not only your own stack total but also your opponent's. This awareness allows you to make informed decisions that can limit your opponent's options.

- **Control the Pace**: By choosing certain numbers, you can control the progression of both stack totals, potentially forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a legal move.

- **Avoid Early High Totals**: Jumping to a high stack total early in the game can limit your options in later turns. Balance your number selections to maintain flexibility.

- **Force a Pass**: Aim to leave your opponent in a position where any available number would cause them to exceed **21**, forcing them to pass and giving you an opportunity to reach **21**.

## Conclusion

**Number Stack Attack** combines simple arithmetic with strategic planning, offering depth and replayability in a game that's quick to play and easy to code for a command-line interface. Mastery comes from anticipating your opponent's moves, managing your stack total carefully, and making calculated decisions to reach the target total before your opponent.

Enjoy the game, and may the best strategist win!
