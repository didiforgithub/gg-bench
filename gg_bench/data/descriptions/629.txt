# Divisor Duel

## Objective

**Divisor Duel** is a strategic two-player turn-based game where players compete to be the last to add a valid number to a shared chain. Players take turns selecting numbers from a common pool and adding them to the chain under specific mathematical conditions. The primary goal is to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move, thus securing your victory.

---

## Setup

- **Number Pool**: Create a shared pool of integers from **2** to **20**, inclusive.
- **Number Chain**: Start with an empty chain where numbers will be added during the game.
- **Determine First Player**: Decide who will take the first turn (e.g., by coin toss).

---

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**:
  - A list of available numbers: **[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]**.
  - Each number can be selected only once and is removed from the pool after use.

- **Number Chain**:
  - A sequence where players add numbers according to game rules.
  - Begins empty and grows with each valid move.

---

## Turns

1. **Player's Turn Structure**:
   - **Review** the last number in the chain (or any number in the pool if the chain is empty).
   - **Select** a valid number from the pool based on the Rules and Mechanics.
   - **Add** the chosen number to the end of the chain.
   - **Remove** the chosen number from the pool.

2. **Turn Progression**:
   - Players alternate turns following the same structure.
   - The game continues until a player cannot make a valid move.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **First Move**:
   - If the chain is empty, the first player may choose any number from the pool to start the chain.

2. **Valid Moves**:
   - On subsequent turns, a player must select a number from the pool that is **either a divisor or a multiple of the last number in the chain**.
   - **Divisors**: Numbers that divide evenly into the last number.
   - **Multiples**: Numbers that the last number divides evenly into.

3. **Number Usage**:
   - Each number can be used only once. Once selected, it is removed from the pool.

4. **Mandatory Moves**:
   - If a valid move exists, the player must make one.
   - If no valid moves are available on a player's turn, they lose the game.

### Winning the Game

- **Victory Condition**: You win if your opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.
- **Loss Condition**: You lose if you cannot make a valid move on your turn.

## Scoring

- There is no point system.
- **Winning** is achieved by strategic play leading to the opponent's inability to move.
- Each game results in a clear win or lossâ€”no draws are possible.
