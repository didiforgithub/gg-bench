# Divide and Conquer: Game Rule Book

## Objective

**Divide and Conquer** is a strategic two-player, turn-based game. The primary goal is to be the first player to reduce the **Current Number (N)** to **1** through strategic division. Victory is achieved by making the final move that sets the Current Number to 1, thereby winning the game. A player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Starting the Game**:
   - The game begins with a positive integer called the **Current Number (N)**.
   - By default, N is set to **100**, but players may agree on a different starting number before the game begins.

2. **Player Order**:
   - Decide which player will take the first turn (Player 1). This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.

---

## Game Components

1. **Current Number (N)**:
   - A positive integer that changes as the game progresses.
   - It is updated after each valid move by dividing it by a chosen divisor.

2. **Allowed Divisors (D)**:
   - Integers greater than **1** and less than **N** that divide **N** exactly (i.e., no remainder).
   - Divisors change as N changes and are critical to the progression of the game.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players alternate turns, starting with Player 1.
   - On a player's turn:
     - Review the list of **Allowed Divisors (D)** for the current N.
     - **Select** one valid Divisor D that was not used in the immediately preceding turn.
     - **Divide** the Current Number N by the chosen Divisor D.
     - **Update** N to the new value (N = N / D).
     - **Announce** the chosen Divisor and the new N.

2. **Progression of Turns**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns and following the same structure until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Selecting a Divisor**:
   - **Valid Divisors** must meet the following criteria:
     - D > 1
     - D < N
     - N mod D == 0 (D divides N exactly)
     - D is **not the same** as the Divisor used in the immediately preceding turn.

2. **Making a Move**:
   - If a player has at least one valid Divisor, they must select one and perform the division.
   - If a player cannot select a valid Divisor (no Divisors meet the criteria), they lose the game.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who reduces N to **exactly 1** wins the game.
   - If a player cannot make a valid move on their turn, they **lose**, and the other player wins.

4. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Selecting a Divisor that does not meet the criteria is an invalid move.
   - Reusing the Divisor from the previous turn is prohibited.
   - If an invalid move is attempted, the player must choose another Divisor.

## Scoring

- **Win Condition**: Reducing N to 1 on your turn.
- **Loss Condition**: Being unable to make a valid move on your turn.
- There is no point system; the game is won by meeting the win condition.

## Examples

### Example Game Playthrough

#### Starting Number N = 100

---

**Player 1's Turn**:

- **Current N**: 100
- **Allowed Divisors (excluding previous Divisor)**: Since it's the first turn, all valid Divisors are available.
- **Valid Divisors D**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
- **Action**: Player 1 chooses D = **2**.
- **Calculation**: N = 100 / 2 = **50**
- **Announcement**:
  - "Player 1 selects Divisor 2."
  - "Current Number is now 50."

---

**Player 2's Turn**:

- **Current N**: 50
- **Last Divisor Used**: 2
- **Allowed Divisors**: Cannot use D = 2.
- **Valid Divisors D**: 5, 10, 25
- **Action**: Player 2 chooses D = **5**.
- **Calculation**: N = 50 / 5 = **10**
- **Announcement**:
  - "Player 2 selects Divisor 5."
  - "Current Number is now 10."

---

**Player 1's Turn**:

- **Current N**: 10
- **Last Divisor Used**: 5
- **Allowed Divisors**: Cannot use D = 5.
- **Valid Divisors D**: 2
- **Action**: Player 1 chooses D = **2**.
- **Calculation**: N = 10 / 2 = **5**
- **Announcement**:
  - "Player 1 selects Divisor 2."
  - "Current Number is now 5."

---

**Player 2's Turn**:

- **Current N**: 5
- **Last Divisor Used**: 2
- **Allowed Divisors**: Cannot use D = 2.
- **Valid Divisors D**: None (since 5 is a prime number greater than 2)
- **Action**: Player 2 has no valid Divisors.
- **Result**:
  - "Player 2 cannot make a valid move."
  - "Player 1 wins the game!"

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Game Start! Current Number N = 100

Player 1's turn.
Available Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50
Enter your divisor: 2
> Player 1 selects Divisor 2.
> Current Number is now 50.

Player 2's turn.
Available Divisors (excluding 2): 5, 10, 25
Enter your divisor: 5
> Player 2 selects Divisor 5.
> Current Number is now 10.

Player 1's turn.
Available Divisors (excluding 5): 2
Enter your divisor: 2
> Player 1 selects Divisor 2.
> Current Number is now 5.

Player 2's turn.
No valid Divisors available. You cannot make a move.
Player 1 wins the game!
```

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's possible moves and plan your divisors to limit their options.
- **Avoid Primes**: Try not to leave the Current Number as a prime number greater than 2 on your opponent's turn, as this may force them into a losing position.
- **Control the Divisors**: By selecting certain divisors, you can manipulate the possible divisors available to your opponent on their next turn.
