# Gridlock Showdown

## Objective

Be the last player able to make a legal move by strategically placing your markers on the grid while blocking your opponent's options. The game ends when one player cannot place a marker on their turn, resulting in their loss. There are no draws; a game of Gridlock Showdown always concludes with a clear winner and a loser.

## Setup

- **Grid Size**: A 5x5 grid (5 rows and 5 columns) is used for the game.
- **Initial State**: All cells in the grid are empty at the start.
- **Players**: Two players, designated as Player 1 and Player 2.
  - **Player 1 Marker**: `X`
  - **Player 2 Marker**: `O`
- **Starting Player**: Determine randomly or agree upon who will take the first turn.

## Game Components

- **Grid**: A virtual 5x5 grid displayed in the command-line interface. Each cell is identified by its row (1-5) and column (1-5) numbers.
- **Markers**: Symbols representing each player's moves.
  - **Player 1** uses `X`
  - **Player 2** uses `O`
- **Command-Line Interface**: Players input commands to place their markers on the grid.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns, starting with the designated starting player.
- **Player Actions During a Turn**:
  1. **Input Move**: Select an empty cell to place your marker by specifying the row and column numbers.
  2. **Validation**: Ensure the chosen cell is empty and not adjacent (including diagonally) to any of the opponent's markers.
  3. **Placement**: Place your marker on the validated cell.
- **Turn Progression**: Once a player has placed their marker, the turn passes to the opponent.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Placement Rules**:
  - A player may place their marker on any empty cell that is **not adjacent** to any of the opponent's markers.
  - Adjacency includes all eight cells surrounding a given cell (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors).
- **Illegal Moves**:
  - Placing a marker on a cell adjacent to an opponent's marker.
  - Selecting a cell that is already occupied.
- **Winning the Game**:
  - If a player has no legal moves on their turn, they lose the game.
  - There are no draw conditions; the game must result in a win for one player.

## Scoring

- **Winning**: The player who successfully blocks their opponent from making a legal move is declared the winner.
- **Tracking Score** (Optional for multiple games):
  - Players can keep a tally of wins if playing multiple rounds.
  - No points are assigned; simply count the number of games won by each player.

### Sample Turns

#### Turn 1: Player 1

- **Action**: Player 1 places an `X` at cell (3, 3).
- **Command-Line Input**: `Place X at row 3 column 3`

**Grid State**:

```
   1   2   3   4   5
1  . | . | . | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---

  ---+---+---+---+---
5  . | . | . | . | .
```

#### Turn 2: Player 2

- **Available Moves**: Any empty cell not adjacent to (3, 3).
- **Invalid Cells**: Cells adjacent to (3, 3) are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).
- **Action**: Player 2 places an `O` at cell (1, 1).
- **Command-Line Input**: `Place O at row 1 column 1`

**Grid State**:

```
   1   2   3   4   5
1  O | . | . | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
2  . | . | . | . | .

3  . | . | X | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
4  . | . | . | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
5  . | . | . | . | .
```

#### Turn 3: Player 1

- **Invalid Cells**: Cells adjacent to opponent's `O` at (1,1) are blocked: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).
- **Action**: Player 1 places an `X` at cell (5, 5).
- **Command-Line Input**: `Place X at row 5 column 5`

**Grid State**:

```
   1   2   3   4   5
1  O | . | . | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
2  . | . | . | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
3  . | . | X | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
4  . | . | . | . | .
  ---+---+---+---+---
5  . | . | . | . | X
```

#### Subsequent Turns

Players continue placing their markers, avoiding cells adjacent to the opponent's markers.

#### Endgame Scenario

If at any point a player cannot find a legal cell to place their marker because all available cells are adjacent to the opponent's markers or occupied, that player loses the game.

## Strategy Tips

- **Central Control**: Placing markers toward the center can limit your opponent's options more effectively.
- **Block Opponent's Access**: Aim to section off parts of the grid, forcing your opponent into areas where they have fewer options.
- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's potential moves and position your markers to block them.
- **Stay Flexible**: Keep your options open by avoiding placing your markers too close to each other unless strategically beneficial.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

**Player 1's Turn**:

```
Player 1 (X), enter your move (row and column): 3 3
You placed an X at (3, 3).
```

**Player 2's Turn**:

```
Player 2 (O), enter your move (row and column): 2 2
Invalid move. The cell is adjacent to your opponent's marker.
Available cells: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), ...]
Player 2 (O), enter your move (row and column): 1 1
You placed an O at (1, 1).
```

**Player 1's Turn**:

```
Player 1 (X), enter your move (row and column): 2 2
Invalid move. The cell is adjacent to your opponent's marker.
Available cells: [(1,5), (2,5), (4,1), (5,5), ...]
Player 1 (X), enter your move (row and column): 5 5
You placed an X at (5, 5).
```

**...**

**Ending the Game**:

If Player 2 cannot find a legal move:

```
Player 2 (O), you have no legal moves available.
Player 1 (X) wins the game!
```
