The action space in the gym environment is defined as `Discrete(100)`, meaning it includes integers from `0` to `99`. In this implementation, each action index `a` corresponds to a possible divisor by mapping it to the actual divisor `d` using the formula `d = a + 1`. This means action index `0` represents the divisor `1`, action index `1` represents the divisor `2`, and so forth, up to action index `99` representing the divisor `100`. This mapping allows the environment to work with action indices while ensuring that actions correspond to potential divisors players can choose during the game.
