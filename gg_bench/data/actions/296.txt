In the game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(10)`, which represents bids from 1 to 10. Each action space index corresponds to a specific bid number. Specifically, action index `0` corresponds to bidding the number `1`, index `1` to bidding the number `2`, and so on until index `9`, which corresponds to bidding the number `10`. Thus, each index `i` in the action space maps to a bid of `i + 1`. Each bid can only be used once, reflecting the rules where numbers are discarded after use.
