# Tower Switch

## Objective

Tower Switch is a two-player, turn-based strategy game. The primary goal is to be the player who removes the last block from the tower. Players take turns removing blocks from the top of a shared tower, strategically deciding how many blocks to remove to force their opponent into a losing position.

## Setup

- **Tower Construction**: Begin with a tower consisting of 10 blocks, numbered from 1 (the top block) to 10 (the bottom block). The blocks are arranged in a single vertical stack.
- **Player Positions**: Players decide who will take the first turn. This can be determined randomly or by mutual agreement.
- **Starting Conditions**: Both players are aware of the initial tower structure and the rules governing block removal.

## Game Components

- **Tower Blocks**: 
  - **Appearance**: The tower is represented as a list or sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 in the command-line interface.
  - **Functionality**: Each block represents a level in the tower. Blocks are removed starting from the top (lowest-numbered block) downwards.
  - **Unique Attributes**: The blocks are indistinct except for their position in the tower, which is crucial for gameplay.

## Turns

- **Turn Structure**:
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - On a player's turn, they remove blocks from the top of the tower according to the rules.
- **Order of Actions**:
  1. **Determine Allowed Moves**: Based on the previous turn, ascertain whether you can remove 1 block or have the option to remove 1 or 2 blocks.
  2. **Select Number of Blocks to Remove**: Choose the number of blocks to remove from the top of the tower.
  3. **Update the Tower**: Remove the blocks and display the updated tower status.
  4. **Pass the Turn**: The next player now takes their turn under the updated conditions.
- **Progression of Turns**: The number of blocks a player can remove on their turn depends on the previous player's move.

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Initial Move**:
   - The first player may remove either 1 or 2 blocks from the top of the tower.
2. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - **If the previous player removed 1 block**: The next player may choose to remove **1 or 2 blocks**.
   - **If the previous player removed 2 blocks**: The next player may **only remove 1 block**.
3. **Removal of Blocks**:
   - Blocks must be removed from the top of the tower (i.e., the lowest-numbered remaining block(s)).
   - Players cannot skip levels or remove blocks from the middle or bottom of the tower.
4. **Turn Action**:
   - On their turn, a player must remove the allowed number of blocks. Skipping a turn or removing zero blocks is not permitted.
5. **Winning the Game**:
   - The player who removes the **last block** (block number 10) from the tower wins the game.

### Special Mechanics

- **Switch Mechanism**:
  - The allowable number of blocks a player can remove on their turn is directly influenced by the previous player's move.
  - This switch in allowed moves adds a strategic layer, requiring players to think ahead and anticipate their opponent's options.

## Scoring

- **Winning the Game**: The primary objective is to win by being the player to remove the last block from the tower.
- **No Point System**: There is no point tracking or scoring beyond determining the winner of each game.
- **Match Play (Optional)**: Players may agree to play multiple rounds, tracking the number of games each player wins.
