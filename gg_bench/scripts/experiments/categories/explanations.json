  "“Numerical Target Games”: Games where players compete to reach a specific numeric total (e.g., 23, 27, 50) exactly by adding or subtracting numbers",
  "“Abstract Strategy Games”: Games focusing on pure logic and strategic maneuvers without thematic elements, often with simple sets of rules but high strategic depth",
  "“Arithmetic Progression / Sequence-Building Games”: Games revolving around creating sequences (e.g., arithmetic progressions, sets of numbers) to achieve victory",
  "“Divisor / Factor Games”: Games that revolve around finding or subtracting divisors (proper or co-prime) of a shared number, leveraging knowledge of prime factorizations",
  "“Attack-Defend Games”: Games featuring Life Points (LP) or Shield Points, allowing players to use numbers to either attack the opponent’s health or bolster their own defense",
