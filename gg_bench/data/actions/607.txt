The action space in the game is represented by integers from 0 to 9999, where each action corresponds to a potential subrange. An action is decoded into a subrange using the formula: 

- `new_lower = action // 100 + 1`
- `new_upper = action % 100 + 1`

Here, `new_lower` and `new_upper` represent the new subrange's lower and upper bounds, respectively. This mapping ensures each action defines a unique subrange within the rules of the game, with `new_lower` and `new_upper` set to values from 1 to 100 based on the encoded integer action.
