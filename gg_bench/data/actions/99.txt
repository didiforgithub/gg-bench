In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 29, each corresponding to a number from 1 to 30. Each index in the action space represents the number at that index plus one. For instance, an action index of 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, an action index of 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to an action index of 29 which corresponds to selecting the number 30. This mapping allows the players to choose numbers based on their zero-based index in the pool of available numbers.
