In the provided gym environment for the game "Clash of Numbers," the action space indices (ranging from 0 to 8) correspond directly to the numbers available for selection in the game, which are numbers from 1 to 9. Specifically, each action index `i` maps to the number `i + 1`. For example, an action index of 0 corresponds to selecting the number 1, an action index of 1 corresponds to selecting the number 2, and so on, up to an action index of 8 which corresponds to selecting the number 9. This mapping ensures that each action taken by a player translates to the selection of a specific number from the number pool.
