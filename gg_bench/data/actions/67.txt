The action space in the game is defined by `spaces.Discrete(50)`, where each action corresponds to selecting a number from 1 to 50 inclusive. Specifically, action index `i` (ranging from 0 to 49) maps directly to choosing the number `i + 1`. Therefore, action 0 corresponds to choosing number 1, action 1 corresponds to choosing number 2, and so on, up to action 49, which corresponds to choosing number 50.
