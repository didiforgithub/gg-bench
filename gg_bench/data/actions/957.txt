In the gym environment, the action space indices (0 to 6) correspond to the game's position numbers (1 to 7). Each index represents a position on the array that a player can choose to flip, and the mapping is direct, where an action index of `n` corresponds to position `n + 1` in the game. Index 0 translates to flipping positions 1 and 2, index 6 to flipping positions 6 and 7, and indices 1 through 5 involve flipping the chosen position and its immediate neighbors on both sides.
