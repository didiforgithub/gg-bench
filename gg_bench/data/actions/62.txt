The action space indices map to moves as follows:

- **0**: Pass (do not attack or defend).
- **1-3**: Play the card at position 0-2 in the player's hand. The index corresponds to the position of the card within the hand, where the card at position 0 is the first card, position 1 is the second, and position 2 is the third.
