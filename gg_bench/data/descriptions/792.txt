**Code Breaker Duel**

---

**Objective:**

The primary goal of *Code Breaker Duel* is to be the first player to correctly guess your opponent's secret three-digit code. Victory is achieved by using logical deduction and strategic guessing based on feedback provided after each guess. A player wins by accurately identifying the opponent's code before their own code is guessed.

---

**Setup:**

1. **Secret Code Selection:**
   - Each player secretly selects a three-digit code composed of digits ranging from **1** to **5**.
   - Digits may be repeated in the code (e.g., codes like `1-1-1` or `2-3-2` are valid).
   - Players write down their secret code and keep it hidden from their opponent.

2. **Determine Turn Order:**
   - Decide who will take the first turn. This can be done via mutual agreement or a simple method like a coin toss.

---

**Game Components:**

1. **Secret Codes:**
   - Each player has a unique three-digit secret code that remains concealed until correctly guessed by the opponent.

2. **Guess Log:**
   - Players may keep a personal log of guesses and feedback to aid in tracking information and formulating future guesses.

3. **Feedback Indicators:**
   - **Hit:** Indicates a digit in the guess that matches a digit in the opponent's secret code **in the exact position**.
   - **Miss:** Indicates a digit in the guess that matches a digit in the opponent's secret code but **in a different position**.

---

**Turns:**

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
   - On each turn, the active player performs the following actions:
     - **Make a Guess:** Propose a three-digit code as a guess for the opponent's secret code.
     - **Receive Feedback:** The opponent provides feedback based on the guess.

2. **Making a Guess:**
   - The guess must be a valid three-digit code using digits from **1** to **5**.
   - The guess is announced clearly to the opponent.

3. **Providing Feedback:**
   - The opponent analyzes the guess in relation to their secret code and provides feedback:
     - Count the number of **Hits** and **Misses**.
     - Do **not** reveal which specific digits are Hits or Misses.
     - Feedback is communicated in terms of the total number of Hits and Misses.

4. **Example Feedback:**
   - "Your guess has **1 Hit** and **2 Misses**."

5. **Ending a Turn:**
   - After receiving feedback, the turn passes to the other player.

---

**Rules and Mechanics:**

1. **Valid Digits:**
   - Only digits from **1** to **5** are used in codes and guesses.

2. **Digit Positions:**
   - Positions in the code are numbered from left to right as the first, second, and third digits.

3. **Feedback Details:**
   - **Hit:**
     - A guessed digit matches a digit in the opponent's code **exactly in both digit and position**.
   - **Miss:**
     - A guessed digit matches a digit in the opponent's code but is **in a different position**.
   - **No Match:**
     - A guessed digit does not appear in the opponent's code at all.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - A player wins immediately upon receiving feedback of **3 Hits**, meaning their guess exactly matches the opponent's secret code.

5. **Tie Scenario:**
   - If both players guess each other's codes correctly on the same turn, the player who took the **first turn** is declared the winner to avoid a draw.

6. **Honesty and Integrity:**
   - Players must provide accurate and truthful feedback.
   - Once chosen, a secret code cannot be changed during the game.

**Scoring:**

- *Code Breaker Duel* is a win-lose game without point tracking.
- The player who first guesses the opponent's secret code wins the game.
- For extended matches, players can keep track of the number of games won over multiple rounds.
