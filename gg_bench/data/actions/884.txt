In this gym environment, the action space is defined by indices 0 to 8, where indices 0 to 7 correspond to selecting a specific prime number from the list `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`, and index 8 corresponds to the "pass" action. Each action index directly maps to a prime number: action 0 selects prime 2, action 1 selects prime 3, and so on up to action 7 selecting prime 19. The "pass" action (index 8) is used when no valid moves are possible.
