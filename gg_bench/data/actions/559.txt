In the gym environment, the action space is defined as a discrete space with 3 possible actions: indices 0, 1, and 2. These indices map directly to move distances of 1, 2, and 3 positions on the number line, respectively. Thus, action index 0 corresponds to moving the marker 1 position, index 1 corresponds to moving 2 positions, and index 2 corresponds to moving 3 positions.
