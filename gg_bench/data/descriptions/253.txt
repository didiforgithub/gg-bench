## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - Decide who goes first (e.g., Player 1 starts first).

- **Player Actions on Their Turn**:
  1. **Choose Movement**:
     - Select a movement value of **1**, **2**, or **3**.
  2. **Move the Token**:
     - Move the token towards your goal position by the chosen number of steps.
     - **Player 1** moves the token **left** (towards **0**).
     - **Player 2** moves the token **right** (towards **20**).

- **Turn Progression**:
  - After a player moves the token, the turn passes to the other player.
  - Continue alternating turns until one player wins.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Movement Rules**:
   - Players must move the token towards their own goal.
   - Movement must be **1**, **2**, or **3** positions per turn.
   - The token cannot move beyond the number line limits (**0** or **20**).

2. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to move the token to their exact goal position (**0** or **20**) wins.
   - A player cannot make a move that would cause the token to pass their goal position.

3. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player attempts to move the token beyond the limits of the number line, they must choose a valid move.
   - Skipping a turn is not allowed.

  - The winner is the player who first moves the token to their goal position.
- **No Point Tracking**:
  - There are no points or scores to track beyond determining the winner.

## Strategy Tips

- **Planning Ahead**:
  - Anticipate your opponent's possible moves to block their path.
  - Calculate the number of moves required to reach your goal from the current position.

- **Control the Token**:
  - Try to keep the token closer to your side of the number line.
  - Force the token into positions where your opponent has fewer advantageous moves.

- **Optimal Moves**:
  - Be mindful of the remaining distance to your goal.
  - Choose movements that set up a winning sequence of moves for yourself.

  - Begin with the token at a different position to alter the dynamic.
  
- **Alter Movement Options**:
  - Allow movements of different ranges (e.g., **1-4** steps) to increase complexity.

- **Multiple Tokens**:
  - Introduce additional tokens with the same rules for advanced strategic play.
