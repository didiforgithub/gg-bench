# Add or Multiply: A Two-Player Turn-Based Game

## Objective

The objective of **Add or Multiply** is to be the first player to reach or exceed the target number of **31** by strategically adding to or multiplying the shared current number. Players take turns choosing to either add or multiply the current number using integers from **1** to **5** inclusive. The first player to reach or exceed **31** wins the game.

## Setup

- **Starting Current Number**: The game begins with the current number set to **1**.
- **Target Number**: Establish the target number as **31**.
- **Player Order**: Decide which player goes first (e.g., via coin toss or mutual agreement).

## Game Components

- **Current Number**: A shared number that starts at **1** and changes based on players' actions.
- **Target Number**: The number **31**; players aim to reach or exceed this number.
- **Allowed Integers**: Numbers from **1** to **5** inclusive; players use these numbers to add or multiply.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is played via a command-line interface where players input their choices.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game.
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Choose Operation**: On their turn, a player selects either to **add** or **multiply**.
  2. **Select Number**: The player chooses an integer from **1** to **5** inclusive.
  3. **Perform Operation**: The chosen operation is performed using the selected number, and the current number is updated accordingly.
  4. **Check for Win**: After updating, check if the current number has reached or exceeded the target number.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Operations**:
   - **Addition**: Add an integer between **1** and **5** to the current number.
     - **Formula**: `Current Number = Current Number + Selected Number`
   - **Multiplication**: Multiply the current number by an integer between **1** and **5**.
     - **Formula**: `Current Number = Current Number * Selected Number`
2. **Allowed Numbers**:
   - Only integers from **1** to **5** inclusive can be used for operations.
3. **Valid Moves**:
   - Each turn must consist of one operation (**add** or **multiply**) and one integer (**1** to **5**).
4. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to make the current number **equal to or exceed 31** wins.
5. **Invalid Moves**:
   - If a player inputs an invalid operation or number (e.g., an operation other than add/multiply or a number outside 1-5), they must retry with a valid move.
6. **No Draws**:
   - The game continues until one player wins; there are no draws.

## Scoring

- The game result is a **win** or **loss**.
- Players may track the number of games won if playing multiple rounds.
