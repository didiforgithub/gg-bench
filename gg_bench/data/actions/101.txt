In the gym environment for the game "Pocket Addition," the action space indices are mapped to game moves as follows:

- Indices 0 to 8 correspond to selecting the number 1 to 9 from the shared pool, respectively.
- Index 9 represents the "pass" action, which a player must take when adding any remaining number would cause their total sum to exceed 15.
