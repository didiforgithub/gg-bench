In the game "Resource War," the action space is represented by an instance of `spaces.Discrete(11)`, which means the action space consists of discrete values ranging from 0 to 10 inclusive, corresponding to possible bid amounts. Each index in this action space directly represents the number of Bidding Points the current player chooses to wager in a round. For example, if a player selects action index 3, it indicates a bid of 3 Bidding Points in that round.
