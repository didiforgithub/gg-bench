# Even Sum Duel

## Objective

Be the first player to achieve an **even cumulative total greater than 15** by selecting numbers from a shared pool. Players aim to strategically choose numbers to reach the target sum while blocking their opponent's progress.

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players, referred to as Player 1 and Player 2.
- **Initial Setup**:
  - A shared pool of **numbers from 1 to 10**.
  - Both players start with a cumulative total of **0**.

## Game Components

- **Number Pool**:
  - **Numbers**: Integers from **1** to **10** inclusive.
  - **Availability**: Each number can be selected **only once** per game.
- **Player Totals**:
  - Each player maintains their own **cumulative total**.
  - Totals are updated after each turn based on the selected number.

## Turns

- **Turn Order**:
  - Players decide who goes first (e.g., by coin toss).
  - Players take **alternating turns** throughout the game.
- **Turn Actions**:
  - On their turn, a player must:
    1. **Select a Number**: Choose an available number from the pool.
    2. **Update Total**: Add the selected number to their cumulative total.
- **Progression**:
  - The selected number is removed from the pool, making it unavailable for future turns.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Number Selection**:
   - Players can only choose from numbers that are still available in the pool.
   - Each number can be selected only once in the game.

2. **Cumulative Total**:
   - Players maintain a running total of the numbers they have selected.
   - The total is updated after each selection.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The first player to reach an **even cumulative total greater than 15** wins the game.
   - **Even totals** are numbers divisible by 2 (e.g., 16, 18, 20).

4. **Exceeding 20**:
   - If a player's cumulative total exceeds **20** without achieving an even total greater than 15, they remain in the game but cannot win unless their opponent also fails to meet the winning condition.

5. **End of Game Without a Winner**:
   - If all numbers have been selected and neither player has achieved an even cumulative total greater than 15:
     - The player with the **highest cumulative total** wins.
     - If both players have the same cumulative total, the **last player to take a turn loses**.

6. **Example of Even Totals Greater Than 15**:
   - Valid winning totals: **16**, **18**, **20**.
   - Totals like **14** or **15** do not qualify, as they are not both even and greater than 15.

## Scoring

- **Cumulative Total Tracking**:
  - Players should keep track of their totals after each turn.
- **Winning Condition**:
  - No traditional scoring system; the game is won by meeting the objective conditions.
- **Tiebreaker**:
  - Highest total when all numbers are exhausted wins if no player met the primary objective.

## Examples
