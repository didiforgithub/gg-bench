The action space indices in the game range from 0 to 99, corresponding to player bids from 1 to 100 tokens. An action index of `i` maps directly to a bid of `i + 1` tokens. This shift accounts for the need to bid at least 1 token (as 0 would not be a valid bid). Therefore, the index `0` in the action space translates to a bid of `1` token, index `1` to a bid of `2` tokens, and so forth, up to index `99`, which corresponds to a maximum bid of `100` tokens.
