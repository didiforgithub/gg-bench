The action space indices in the gym environment for the game "Palindrome Quest" map to possible player moves as follows: action indices `0` to `8` correspond to appending the digits `1` to `9` respectively to the shared number `N`. This mapping shifts each index up by 1 to represent valid digit choices, ensuring that indices used as actions directly match with game-legal appending options.
