In the game environment, the action space indices map to movement distances as follows: index 0 corresponds to moving 1 position ahead, index 1 corresponds to moving 2 positions ahead, and index 2 corresponds to moving 3 positions ahead. Therefore, selecting an action of index 0, 1, or 2 results in advancing by 1, 2, or 3 positions, respectively, on the track.
