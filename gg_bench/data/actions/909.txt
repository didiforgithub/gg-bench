In the game environment, the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(2)`, which means there are two possible discrete actions available, represented by indices. The mapping between the action space indices and the moves in the game is as follows:
- Index `0`: Represents the operation **Add 1** (`+1`), which increases the current number by 1.
- Index `1`: Represents the operation **Multiply by 2** (`*2`), which multiplies the current number by 2.

These indices allow players to select one of the two operations available during their turn.
