# **Factor Frenzy**

## **Objective**

Be the player to force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move by strategically selecting numbers and eliminating options from the shared pool of numbers. Victory is achieved when your opponent has no available moves on their turn.

## **Setup**

1. **Number Pool Initialization**: Create a shared list of integers ranging from **2 to 50** inclusive.
   
2. **Starting Player**: Determine who takes the first turn, either randomly or by mutual agreement.

## **Game Components**

- **Number Pool**: A list containing integers from **2 to 50**. This pool represents the available numbers players can select during the game.
  
- **Selected Numbers**: A record of numbers that have been chosen during the game, along with their factors and multiples which are subsequently removed from the Number Pool.

- **Players**: Two players, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

## **Turns**

- Players alternate turns starting with the designated starting player.
  
- **Turn Structure**:
  1. **Selection Phase**: The active player selects an available number from the Number Pool.
  
  2. **Elimination Phase**: After selecting, all factors and multiples of the chosen number are removed from the Number Pool.

- The game continues in this fashion until a player cannot make a valid selection on their turn.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Valid Selection**:
   - On your turn, you must select a number from the current Number Pool.
   - If there are no available numbers to select, you lose the game.

2. **Number Selection**:
   - **Choosing a Number**: Select any remaining number from the Number Pool.

3. **Elimination of Numbers**:
   - **Factors and Multiples Removal**:
     - Once a number is selected, both that number and all of its factors and multiples are removed from the Number Pool.
     - **Factors**: Numbers less than the chosen number that divide evenly into it.
     - **Multiples**: Numbers greater than the chosen number that the chosen number divides evenly into.

   - **Example**:
     - If **12** is selected, remove **2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48** from the Number Pool.

4. **Unavailable Moves**:
   - If a player cannot select a number because the Number Pool is empty, or all remaining numbers have been eliminated due to previous selections, that player loses.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - You win by forcing your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

6. **Game End**:
   - The game ends immediately when a player has no valid moves on their turn.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory**: Winning the game constitutes achieving the primary objective and is noted as a win for the player.
  
- **Match Play**:
  - Players may choose to play multiple games in a match format where the first player to reach a predetermined number of victories wins the match.

## **Examples**

- **Updated Number Pool**: **6**, **7**.

**Turn 4 - Player 2**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **6**.
- **Elimination**:
  - Factors of **6**: **6** (itself).
  - Multiples of **6** within the pool: None.
  - **Numbers Removed**: **6**.
- **Updated Number Pool**: **7**.

**Turn 5 - Player 1**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **7**.
- **Elimination**:
  - Factors of **7**: **7** (itself).
  - Multiples of **7** within the pool: None.
  - **Numbers Removed**: **7**.
- **Updated Number Pool**: Empty.

**Turn 6 - Player 2**:
- **No Valid Moves**: The Number Pool is empty.
- **Result**: **Player 2 loses**, **Player 1 wins**.

### **Example 2: Strategic Play**

**Initial Number Pool**: 2 to 20.

**Turn 1 - Player 1**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **7**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 7, 14**.

**Turn 2 - Player 2**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **9**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 3, 9, 18**.

**Turn 3 - Player 1**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **8**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 2, 4, 8, 16**.

**Turn 4 - Player 2**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **5**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 5, 10, 15, 20**.

**Turn 5 - Player 1**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **11**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 11**.

**Turn 6 - Player 2**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **13**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 13**.

**Turn 7 - Player 1**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **17**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 17**.

**Turn 8 - Player 2**:
- **Selection**: Chooses **19**.
- **Elimination**:
  - **Numbers Removed**: **1, 19**.

**Turn 9 - Player 1**:
- **No Valid Moves**: Remaining numbers (**12**, **6**) have been eliminated as factors/multiples.
- **Result**: **Player 1 loses**, **Player 2 wins**.

**Note on Strategy**:

- **Prime Numbers**: Selecting prime numbers can be advantageous as they have fewer factors and multiples, thus eliminating fewer options from the Number Pool for yourself but potentially limiting your opponent's future moves.

- **Composite Numbers**: Choosing composite numbers with many factors and multiples can eliminate more options from the Number Pool, potentially restricting your opponent's valid moves.
