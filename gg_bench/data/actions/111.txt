The action space indices in the game directly correspond to the positions of the bits in the 4-bit binary number. The indices range from 0 to 3, where each index represents a specific bit position that a player can choose to flip from `0` to `1` during their turn. Specifically:

- Index `0` maps to bit position `3` (the leftmost bit, also known as the most significant bit).
- Index `1` maps to bit position `2`.
- Index `2` maps to bit position `1`.
- Index `3` maps to bit position `0` (the rightmost bit, also known as the least significant bit).

Players select an index from the action space to flip the corresponding bit.
