In the game environment, the action space indices map to player moves as follows:

- **Indices 0 to 4**: Correspond to placing blocks of sizes **1 to 5** units, respectively. For example, an action index of 0 means placing a block of size 1 unit, while an action index of 4 means placing a block of size 5 units.
- **Index 5**: Represents the decision to pass the turn without placing a block.
