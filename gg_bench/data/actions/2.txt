In the game, the action space indices range from 0 to 8, corresponding directly to the numbers 1 to 9 in the game's shared number pool. Each index increment directly maps to the next integer in sequence. For example, action index 0 maps to the number 1, action index 1 maps to the number 2, and so on, up to action index 8, which maps to the number 9. This mapping allows players to choose numbers based on their corresponding actions within the environment.
