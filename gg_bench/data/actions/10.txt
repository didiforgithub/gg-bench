In the provided gym environment for the Zero Sum Duel game, the action space is defined with 20 discrete actions (0-19). These actions are mapped to game moves as follows:

- **Actions 0-9**: Correspond to subtracting numbers 1-10 from the shared number. Specifically, action `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 9) means subtracting `i + 1` from the shared number.
  
- **Actions 10-19**: Correspond to adding numbers 1-10 to the shared number. Specifically, action `j` (where `j` ranges from 10 to 19) means adding `j - 9` to the shared number.

This structure allows each action to directly represent a move of either adding or subtracting a specific number within the allowed range.
