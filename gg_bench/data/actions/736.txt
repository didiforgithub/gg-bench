In the Divider Game's gym environment, the action space indices represent possible numbers a player can subtract from the current total. Each index corresponds directly to an integer value, ranging from 0 up to `initial_total - 1`. However, only indices corresponding to positive integers that are valid divisors of the current total (excluding the total itself) are actionable. Thus, the index `i` represents the move of subtracting the integer `i` from the current total, provided it satisfies the criteria of being a valid divisor.
