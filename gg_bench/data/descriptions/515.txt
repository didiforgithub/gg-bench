# Code Swap

## Objective

Be the first player to arrange your code numbers in **ascending order** (from lowest to highest). Achieve this by strategically swapping positions within your own code or swapping with your opponent's code.

---

## Setup

- **Players**: Two players.
- **Codes**: Each player is assigned a code consisting of a sequence of **three numbers**.
  - The numbers range from **1 to 5** and may include duplicates.
  - The initial arrangement of each player's code is **randomly determined** at the start of the game.

---

## Game Components

- **Player Codes**: Each player has their own code, represented as an ordered list of three numbers.
  - **Positions**: The code positions are labeled **Position 1**, **Position 2**, and **Position 3**.
- **Numbers**: The digits used in the codes (1 to 5). Numbers can repeat within a code.

---

## Turns

- Players take turns **alternately**.
- A coin toss or random selection determines who takes the **first turn**.

### On Your Turn, Choose One of Two Actions:

1. **Swap Within Your Code**:
   - Swap the numbers between **any two positions** in your own code.
   - Example: Swap the numbers in Position 1 and Position 3.
2. **Swap with Opponent's Code**:
   - Swap the number in **one position** of your code with the number in the **same position** in your opponent's code.
   - Example: Swap the number in Position 2 of your code with the number in Position 2 of your opponent's code.

## Rules and Mechanics

- **Goal**: Arrange your code in **ascending order** (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
- **Swapping Guidelines**:
  - **Swapping Within Your Code**:
    - Specify **two positions** in your code to swap.
  - **Swapping with Opponent's Code**:
    - Specify **one position** to swap.
    - The swap occurs at the **same position** in both codes.
- **Mandatory Action**: You **must** perform one of the two actions on your turn.
- **End of Turn**:
  - After making a swap, check if your code is in ascending order.
  - If **yes**, you win.
  - If **no**, the turn passes to your opponent.

## Scoring

- The **first player** to arrange their code numbers in **ascending order** wins the game.
- There are **no draws**; play continues until one player wins.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your swaps to achieve your goal efficiently.
- **Disrupt Opponent**: Use swaps with your opponent to exchange your unwanted numbers for those that might disrupt their code.
- **Position Importance**: Focus on swapping numbers into the correct positions rather than just obtaining the right numbers.
- **Balance Actions**: Decide between improving your code and hindering your opponent.

## Summary

Code Swap is a strategic game where players manipulate sequences of numbers to achieve an ordered code before their opponent. By deciding whether to focus on their own code or interfere with their opponent's, players engage in tactical decision-making that can lead to victory. The game's simplicity makes it easy to pick up, yet it offers depth for those who master its nuances.

Enjoy the challenge and may the best code breaker win!
