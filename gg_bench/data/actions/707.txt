The mapping between action space indices and moves in the game is as follows:

- Indices 0-9: Correspond to the `harvest` action with 1-10 Supply Units (SUs), where each index n maps to harvesting (n+1) SUs.
- Index 10: Represents the `spy` action, costing 1 SU to reveal the opponent's Power Points (PP).
- Index 11: Represents the `sabotage` action, costing 2 SUs to reduce the opponentâ€™s PP by 30, unless they are fortified.
- Index 12: Represents the `fortify` action, costing 1 SU to protect own PP from sabotage until the next turn.
- Index 13: Represents doing nothing, taking no action this turn.
