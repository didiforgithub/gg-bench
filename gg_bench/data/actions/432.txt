In the custom gym environment for Stack Attack, the action space indices (0-8) map to the numbers 1-9 used in the game. Each index corresponds directly to the number it represents, where index 0 maps to number 1, index 1 maps to number 2, and so on up to index 8, which maps to number 9. This means that when a player selects an action index during their turn, it translates to placing the corresponding number on the stack according to the game's rules.
