The action space in the environment consists of 19 discrete actions, mapped as follows:

- Actions 0-14: Represent placing a tile on a tower. The action index is determined by the combination of the player's tile selection (numbered 1-5) and the tower selection (A, B, or C). Specifically, each tile (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is paired with each tower (A=0, B=1, C=2), resulting in 15 combinations. For example, index 0 corresponds to placing tile 1 on Tower A, index 1 to placing tile 1 on Tower B, and so forth until index 14 for placing tile 5 on Tower C.

- Action 15: Represents passing the turn when no valid move can be made.

- Actions 16-18: These are used exclusively in sudden death situations to remove the top tile from Tower A (index 16), Tower B (index 17), or Tower C (index 18).
