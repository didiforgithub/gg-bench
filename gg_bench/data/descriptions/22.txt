**Mirror Duel: Rule Book**

---

### **Objective**

Be the first to force your opponent into creating a palindromic sequence of numbers. The primary goal is to strategically add numbers to a shared sequence while avoiding the formation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., `1-2-3-2-1`). The player who adds a number that results in a palindromic sequence loses the game.

---

### **Setup**

- The game is played between two players.
- Begin with an empty sequence displayed in the command-line interface.
- No additional setup is required; players alternate turns starting with Player 1.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Shared Sequence**: A list of numbers that both players contribute to during the game.
- **Numbers**: Digits from `1` to `9` that players can add to the sequence.
- **Positions**: Players can add numbers to either the **front** (left side) or **back** (right side) of the sequence.

---

### **Turns**

- Players take turns alternately, starting with **Player 1**.
- **During a Turn**, a player must:
  1. Choose a number from `1` to `9`.
  2. Decide whether to add the number to the **front** or the **back** of the sequence.
  3. Update the shared sequence accordingly.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

1. **Adding Numbers**:
   - On your turn, select any digit between `1` and `9`.
   - Place the chosen number at either end of the sequence:
     - **Front**: The number becomes the new first element.
     - **Back**: The number becomes the new last element.

2. **Avoid Palindromes**:
   - The shared sequence must **not** form a palindrome after any turn.
   - A palindrome is a sequence that reads identically forwards and backwards (e.g., `2-4-6-4-2`).

3. **Losing the Game**:
   - If a player's move results in the sequence becoming a palindrome, that player **loses**.
   - Carefully consider each move to avoid creating a palindromic sequence.

4. **Valid Moves**:
   - Players **must** add a number on their turn; passing is not allowed.
   - All numbers from `1` to `9` are always available regardless of previous moves.
   - There is no limit to how many times a particular number can be used in the sequence.

5. **End of the Game**:
   - The game ends immediately when a palindrome is formed.
   - The player who did **not** create the palindrome is declared the **winner**.

---

### **Scoring**

- **Win**: If your opponent creates a palindromic sequence, you win the game.
- **Loss**: If you create a palindromic sequence on your turn, you lose the game.
- **No Draws**: The game cannot end in a draw; there is always a winner and a loser in each game.

### **Examples**

#### **Example 1: Basic Gameplay**

- **Starting Sequence**: (empty)

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `3`.
   - Adds `3` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `3`

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `5`.
   - Adds `5` to the **front**.
   - **Sequence**: `5-3`

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `7`.
   - Adds `7` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `5-3-7`
   - This sequence is **not** a palindrome.

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `5`.
   - Adds `5` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `5-3-7-5`
   - This sequence is **not** a palindrome.

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `5`.
   - Adds `5` to the **front**.
   - **Sequence**: `5-5-3-7-5`
   - This sequence **is** a palindrome (`5-5-3-7-5` reads the same forwards and backwards).
   - **Player 1** loses.
   - **Player 2** wins.

#### **Example 2: Strategic Play**

- **Starting Sequence**: (empty)

1. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `1`.
   - Adds `1` to the **front**.
   - **Sequence**: `1`

2. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `2`.
   - Adds `2` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `1-2`

3. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `3`.
   - Adds `3` to the **front**.
   - **Sequence**: `3-1-2`

4. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `4`.
   - Adds `4` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `3-1-2-4`

5. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `2`.
   - Adds `2` to the **front**.
   - **Sequence**: `2-3-1-2-4`
   - Sequence is **not** a palindrome.

6. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `3`.
   - Adds `3` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `2-3-1-2-4-3`
   - Sequence is **not** a palindrome.

7. **Player 1's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `2`.
   - Considers potential moves:
     - Adding `2` to the front would create `2-2-3-1-2-4-3`, which is not a palindrome.
     - Adding `2` to the back would create `2-3-1-2-4-3-2`, which is **a palindrome**.
   - **Player 1** chooses to add `2` to the **front**.
   - **Sequence**: `2-2-3-1-2-4-3`
   - Sequence is **not** a palindrome.

8. **Player 2's Turn**:
   - Chooses number `2`.
   - Adds `2` to the **back**.
   - **Sequence**: `2-2-3-1-2-4-3-2`
   - **Sequence is a palindrome**.
   - **Player 2** loses.
   - **Player 1** wins.

### **Gameplay Tips**

- **Think Ahead**: Always consider how your move will affect the sequence in future turns. Anticipate your opponent's possible moves.
- **Sequence Analysis**: Keep track of the symmetry in the sequence to avoid setting up a palindrome.
- **Forced Moves**: Try to force your opponent into a position where any move they make will create a palindrome.
- **Flexible Placement**: Remember that you can add numbers to either the front or back, giving you strategic options to alter the sequence.

### **Command-Line Interaction Example**

Here's how a sample game might look in a command-line interface:

```
Welcome to Mirror Duel!

Current Sequence: (empty)

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a number (1-9): 4
Add to the (F)ront or (B)ack?: B
Sequence after move: 4

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a number (1-9): 5
Add to the (F)ront or (B)ack?: F
Sequence after move: 5 4

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a number (1-9): 6
Add to the (F)ront or (B)ack?: B
Sequence after move: 5 4 6

Player 2's Turn:
Choose a number (1-9): 5
Add to the (F)ront or (B)ack?: B
Sequence after move: 5 4 6 5

Player 1's Turn:
Choose a number (1-9): 5
Add to the (F)ront or (B)ack?: F
Sequence after move: 5 5 4 6 5
Oh no! The sequence is a palindrome!
Player 1 loses.
Player 2 wins!
```
