The action space indices map to moves in the game as follows:

- There are 11 positions on the board, numbered 0 through 10.
- Each position offers two possible forward moves: 1 square or 2 squares.
- Thus, the action space has 22 indices, with each index representing a specific move from a specific position.
- Specifically, an index `i` corresponds to:
  - `position = i // 2` (integer division by 2, giving the board position from where the token starts its move).
  - `move_distance = (i % 2) + 1` (modulo operation plus one, determining the distance moved: 1 or 2 squares forward).
