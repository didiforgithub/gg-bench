# Factor Frenzy

## Objective

The primary goal of **Factor Frenzy** is to be the last player able to make a valid move according to the game rules. Players take turns selecting numbers from a shared pool based on mathematical relationships with the current number. A player wins by forcing their opponent into a position where they cannot select a valid number on their turn.

---

## Setup

1. **Shared Number Pool**: Create a list of numbers from **2** to **50** inclusive. This is the pool of numbers available for selection during the game.

2. **Current Number**: Initialize the current number to **1** at the start of the game.

3. **Players**: Two players are required. Decide which player goes first (e.g., by agreement or random selection).

---

## Game Components

- **Shared Number Pool**: A collection of integers `[2, 3, 4, ..., 50]`. Each number can be selected only once and is removed from the pool after selection.

- **Current Number**: The number that dictates valid moves. It changes after each valid turn based on the last selected number.

- **Players**: Two participants alternating turns, referred to as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.

---

## Turns

1. **Turn Order**: Players alternate turns throughout the game, starting with the designated first player.

2. **Player Actions**:

   - On your turn, **select a number** from the shared number pool that is either:
     - A **factor** of the current number, **or**
     - A **multiple** of the current number.

   - **Update** the current number to the number you selected.

   - **Remove** the selected number from the shared number pool.

3. **Valid Moves**:

   - A move is valid if the selected number is available in the pool and satisfies the factor or multiple condition with the current number.

---

## Rules and Mechanics

### Core Rules

1. **Valid Selection**:

   - **Factor**: A number `N` is a factor of the current number `C` if `C % N == 0`.

   - **Multiple**: A number `N` is a multiple of the current number `C` if `N % C == 0`.

2. **Number Usage**:

   - Each number from the shared pool can be used **only once**.

   - Once a number is selected and removed, it cannot be chosen again by either player.

3. **Winning the Game**:

   - A player **wins** if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.

   - There is **no possibility of a draw**; the game always results in a win or loss.

### Additional Rules

- **Invalid Moves**:

  - If a player selects an invalid number (not a factor or multiple, or not in the pool), they **lose their turn**, and the opponent gets a chance to win on their next turn.

- **No Skipping**:

  - Players **cannot skip** their turn. If a valid move is available, it must be made.

- **End of Game**:

  - The game ends immediately when a player cannot make a valid move, declaring the other player the winner.

## Scoring

- **Victory**: There is no point-based scoring system. Winning the game is based on the ability to make valid moves and strategically limit the opponent's options.

## Examples

### Example Gameplay

**Starting the Game**

- **Current Number**: 1
- **Shared Number Pool**: [2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 50]

---

**Player 1's Turn**

- **Possible Moves**: Any number from the pool (since all numbers are multiples of 1).
- **Action**: Player 1 selects **5**.
- **Reason**: 5 is a multiple of 1.
- **Update**:
  - **Current Number**: 5
  - **Remove 5** from the pool.

**Shared Number Pool**: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, ..., 50]

---

**Player 2's Turn**

- **Current Number**: 5
- **Possible Moves**: Numbers that are factors or multiples of 5.
- **Available Options**: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 (multiples), **or** none of the factors (since 1 is not in the pool and 5 is already used).
- **Action**: Player 2 selects **10**.
- **Reason**: 10 is a multiple of 5.
- **Update**:
  - **Current Number**: 10
  - **Remove 10** from the pool.

**Shared Number Pool**: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, ..., 50 (excluding 5 and 10)]

---

**Player 1's Next Turn**

- **Current Number**: 10
- **Possible Moves**: Numbers that are factors or multiples of 10.
- **Available Options**: Factors (2) and multiples (20, 30, 40, 50).
- **Action**: Player 1 selects **2**.
- **Reason**: 2 is a factor of 10.
- **Update**:
  - **Current Number**: 2
  - **Remove 2** from the pool.

**Shared Number Pool**: [3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, ..., 50 (excluding 2, 5, 10)]

---

**Example of Invalid Move**

**Player 2's Turn**

- **Current Number**: 2
- **Possible Moves**: Numbers that are factors or multiples of 2.
- **Available Options**: 4, 6, 8, etc. (multiples of 2).
- **Invalid Action**: Player 2 selects **9**.
- **Reason**: 9 is neither a factor nor a multiple of 2.
- **Outcome**: Invalid move. Player 2 loses the game. Player 1 wins.

## Command-Line Interaction Example

```
Welcome to Factor Frenzy!

Starting Number: 1
Shared Number Pool: [2, 3, 4, ..., 50]

---

Player 1's Turn
Current Number: 1
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, ..., 50]
Enter your chosen number: 7
You selected 7.
7 is a valid move.
Current Number is now 7.
Numbers remaining: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, ..., 50 (excluding 7)]

---

Player 2's Turn
Current Number: 7
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, ..., 50 (excluding 7)]
Possible Moves: Factors or multiples of 7.
Enter your chosen number: 14
You selected 14.
14 is a valid move.
Current Number is now 14.
Numbers remaining: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 50 (excluding 7 and 14)]

Current Number: 14
Available Numbers: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 50 (excluding 7 and 14)]
Possible Moves: Factors or multiples of 14.
Enter your chosen number: 7
Error: 7 has already been used. Choose another number.
Enter your chosen number: 28
You selected 28.
28 is a valid move.
Current Number is now 28.
Numbers remaining: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, ..., 50 (excluding 7, 14, 28)]

---

*Game continues until a player cannot make a valid move.*

## Strategic Tips

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering which numbers will be available after your selection.

- **Limit Opponent's Options**: Choose numbers that reduce the valid moves for your opponent.

- **Prime Numbers**: Selecting a prime number as the current number can limit your opponent's options, as primes have fewer factors.

- **Stay Aware**: Keep track of the numbers already used to avoid invalid selections.

---

## Conclusion

**Factor Frenzy** combines mathematical reasoning with strategic planning. By carefully selecting numbers that both advance your position and limit your opponent's options, you can gain a competitive edge. Enjoy the challenge of outsmarting your opponent in this exciting numerical duel!
