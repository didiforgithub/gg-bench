The action space in the game is mapped such that each action index (ranging from 0 to 28) corresponds to selecting a number from 2 to 30. This is achieved by adding 2 to the action index. Therefore, action index 0 corresponds to selecting the number 2, action index 1 corresponds to 3, and so on, up to action index 28 which corresponds to selecting the number 30.
