# Bit Flip Showdown

## Objective

Be the first player to create a byte (8 bits) where the total number of '1's is exactly **six (6)**. Achieve this by strategically flipping bits during your turn while preventing your opponent from doing the same.

## Setup

- **Initial State:** The game starts with a byte consisting of 8 bits, all set to '0'. This is represented as:

  ```
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  ```

- **Player Assignment:** Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**. Decide who goes firstâ€”either randomly or by mutual agreement.

## Game Components

- **Byte:** An 8-bit sequence representing the game state.
- **Bits:** Each bit can be either '0' (off) or '1' (on).
- **Bit Positions:** The bits are numbered from 1 to 8, from left to right.

  ```
  Position:    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  Initial Bit: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  ```

## Turns

### Turn Structure

- **Action:** On your turn, you must flip **exactly one bit**. Flipping changes a '0' to a '1' or a '1' to a '0'.
- **How to Flip:**
  - Specify the position (1-8) of the bit you wish to flip.
  - Only one bit can be flipped per turn.
- **Example:**

  ```
  Current State: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  Player 1's Turn:
  - Flips bit at position 3.
  - New State: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
  ```

### Turn Progression

- Players alternate turns.
- No skipping turns; each player must flip a bit on their turn.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Flipping Bits:**
   - **Mandatory Move:** Flipping a bit each turn is required.
   - **Valid Positions:** Only positions 1 through 8 are valid.
   - **Current State Aware:** Players must flip based on the current state of the byte.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - **Victory:** The first player to create a byte with **exactly six '1's** wins.
   - **Immediate Win:** If your flip results in six '1's, you win instantly.
   - **Example of Winning State:**

     ```
     1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0  (Total '1's = 6)
     ```

3. **Game Continuation:**
   - The game cannot end in a draw.
   - Play continues until one player meets the winning condition.

4. **No Reversing Wins:**
   - Once a player achieves six '1's, the game ends immediately.
   - The opponent does not get an additional turn to alter the state.

## Scoring

- **Single Round Victory:** Winning is achieved by meeting the winning condition in a round.
- **No Points System:** There is no point tracking; each game is a standalone win or loss.
- **Multiple Rounds:** Players may choose to play multiple games, keeping track of wins.

## Examples

### Example Game Play

**Initial State:**

```
Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Bits:      0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Flips bit **3**.
- New State: `0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0`
- Total '1's: 1

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Flips bit **5**.
- New State: `0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0`
- Total '1's: 2

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Flips bit **4**.
- New State: `0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0`
- Total '1's: 3

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Flips bit **6**.
- New State: `0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0`
- Total '1's: 4

**Player 1's Turn:**

- Flips bit **7**.
- New State: `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0`
- Total '1's: 5

**Player 2's Turn:**

- Flips bit **8**.
- New State: `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1`
- Total '1's: 6

**Result:**

- **Player 2 Wins!** They have achieved exactly six '1's.

### Command-Line Interaction Example

**Player 1's Turn:**

```
Current State: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Player 1, select a bit to flip (1-8): 3
New State: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

**Player 2's Turn:**

```
Current State: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
Player 2, select a bit to flip (1-8): 5
New State: 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
```

**...and so on until a player wins.**

## Strategic Considerations

- **Balance Offensive and Defensive Moves:**
  - Increase the count of '1's to approach six.
  - Flip a '1' back to '0' to prevent your opponent from reaching six '1's on their next turn.

- **Predict Opponent's Moves:**
  - Anticipate which bit your opponent might flip.
  - Plan your flips to set up a win while blocking your opponent.

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Experienced players can calculate the optimal sequence of flips.
  - Control the game by maintaining an advantageous number of '1's.

## Tips for Skilled Play

- **Counting:** Keep track of the total number of '1's after each turn.
- **Positioning:** Focus on flipping bits that are less likely to be reversed immediately.
- **Forcing Moves:** Create situations where your opponent has no choice but to make a move that benefits you.

## Conclusion

**Bit Flip Showdown** is a fast-paced, strategic game that tests players' analytical and predictive skills. With simple rules and quick gameplay, it's perfect for command-line play and ensures that skillful players can consistently earn victory through thoughtful planning and execution.
