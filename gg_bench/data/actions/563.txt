The action space indices map to the game moves as follows:
- Index 0 corresponds to moving "up" (decreasing the row index by 1).
- Index 1 corresponds to moving "down" (increasing the row index by 1).
- Index 2 corresponds to moving "left" (decreasing the column index by 1).
- Index 3 corresponds to moving "right" (increasing the column index by 1).
