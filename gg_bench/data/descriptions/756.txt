# Game Name: Lockdown

## Objective

Be the **first player** to set all three dials of the shared lock to **0-0-0**. Strategically adjust the dials while adhering to move restrictions to outmaneuver your opponent and achieve the winning combination.

## Setup

1. **Initialize the Lock:**
   - Create a virtual lock with three dials: **Dial 1**, **Dial 2**, and **Dial 3**.
   - Each dial displays a digit from **0** to **9**.

2. **Set the Initial Combination:**
   - Randomly assign a digit between **0** and **9** to each dial to form the starting combination.
     - *Example:* The lock starts at **3-7-4**.

3. **Determine the First Player:**
   - Decide who goes first by mutual agreement, coin toss, or random selection.

## Game Components

- **Lock Dials:**
  - **Dial 1**, **Dial 2**, **Dial 3**.
  - Each dial shows a single digit from **0** to **9**.
  - Dials can be adjusted incrementally.

- **Player Actions:**
  - **Increment**: Increase a dial's value by **1** (wraps from **9** to **0**).
  - **Decrement**: Decrease a dial's value by **1** (wraps from **0** to **9**).

## Turns

- **Turn Structure:**
  - Players alternate turns throughout the game.
  - During each turn, a player performs the following actions:
    1. **Select One Dial** to adjust (**Dial 1**, **Dial 2**, or **Dial 3**).
    2. **Choose to Increment or Decrement** the selected dial by **1**.

- **Order of Play:**
  - Player 1 takes the first turn.
  - Player 2 takes the next turn.
  - Repeat until the game ends.

## Rules and Mechanics

1. **Adjusting Dials:**

   - **Incrementing a Dial (+1):**
     - Increases the dial's value by **1**.
     - If a dial is at **9**, incrementing wraps it around to **0**.
   - **Decrementing a Dial (-1):**
     - Decreases the dial's value by **1**.
     - If a dial is at **0**, decrementing wraps it around to **9**.

2. **Move Restrictions:**

   - **No Reversals of Opponent's Last Move on the Same Dial:**
     - You **cannot** reverse your opponent's last adjustment on the **same dial**.
     - If your opponent **increased** a dial on their last turn, you **cannot decrease** that dial on your turn.
     - If your opponent **decreased** a dial, you **cannot increase** that dial on your turn.
   - **Allowed Moves:**
     - You may adjust:
       - The **same dial in the same direction** as your opponent's last move.
       - A **different dial** in any direction, regardless of your opponent's last move.

3. **Winning the Game:**

   - The game ends when a player sets the lock combination to **0-0-0**.
   - The player who achieves this combination on their turn **wins the game**.

## Scoring

- **Winning Condition:**
  - There is **no point system**.
  - Victory is achieved by being the first to set all dials to **0-0-0**.
