**Divide and Conquer: Rule Book**

---

### **Objective**

The primary goal of **Divide and Conquer** is to be the player who reduces the shared number to exactly **1**. Players take turns dividing the current number by a whole number greater than 1. The first player to reach a current number of **1** on their turn **wins the game**.

---

### **Setup**

- **Starting Number**: The game begins with a shared positive whole number. By default, this number is **100**, but players can agree on a different positive whole number before starting the game.
- **Players**: Two players are designated as **Player 1** and **Player 2**.
- **Interface**: The game is played through a command-line interface where players input their chosen divisors.

---

### **Game Components**

- **Starting Number**

  - A positive whole number (default is **100**).
  - This number is shared between both players and changes as the game progresses.

- **Divisors**

  - Whole numbers **greater than 1** that exactly divide the current number (resulting in a whole number with no remainder).
  - Players choose from these divisors during their turns.

- **Players**

  - **Player 1** and **Player 2** alternate turns throughout the game.
  - Each player strategically selects divisors to reduce the current number.

---

### **Turns**

- **Turn Order**

  - **Player 1** takes the first turn.
  - Players alternate turns thereafter.

- **Turn Actions**

  1. **Display Current Number**: At the start of a turn, the current number is presented.
  2. **Available Divisors**: All valid divisors greater than 1 for the current number are listed.
  3. **Player Input**: The player selects one of the available divisors.
  4. **Update Current Number**: The current number is divided by the chosen divisor.
  5. **Check for Win Condition**: If the current number becomes 1, the player wins the game.

- **Progression**

  - The game continues with players dividing the current number until a player reduces it to **1** and wins.

---

### **Rules and Mechanics**

- **Valid Moves**

  - On their turn, a player must choose a whole number **greater than 1** that exactly divides the current number.
  - The divisor must result in a whole number when the current number is divided by it.

- **Forbidden Moves**

  - **Dividing by 1** is not allowed.
  - Choosing a divisor that does not exactly divide the current number is invalid.

- **Winning the Game**

  - A player wins immediately when they reduce the current number to exactly **1** on their turn.

- **Losing the Game**

  - If a player has no valid divisors on their turn (i.e., the current number is a prime number greater than 2), they lose, and the other player wins.

- **Special Conditions**

  - If the current number is **2**, the only valid divisor is **2**. Dividing by 2 reduces the number to **1**, resulting in a win for the current player.

- **Game End**

  - The game ends when a player wins by reducing the current number to **1** or when a player cannot make a valid move.

### **Scoring**

- **Win-Loss Outcome**

  - **No points are tracked** during the game.
  - The game results in a win for one player and a loss for the other.

### **Examples**

#### **Example Game Play**

- **Starting Number**: 100

##### **Turn 1: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 100
- **Available Divisors**: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
- **Player 1's Choice**: 2
- **Calculation**: 100 รท 2 = 50
- **New Current Number**: 50

##### **Turn 2: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 50
- **Available Divisors**: 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
- **Player 2's Choice**: 5
- **Calculation**: 50 รท 5 = 10
- **New Current Number**: 10

##### **Turn 3: Player 1**

- **Current Number**: 10
- **Available Divisors**: 2, 5, 10
- **Player 1's Choice**: 2
- **Calculation**: 10 รท 2 = 5
- **New Current Number**: 5

##### **Turn 4: Player 2**

- **Current Number**: 5
- **Available Divisors**: 5
- **Player 2's Choice**: 5
- **Calculation**: 5 รท 5 = 1
- **New Current Number**: 1
- **Outcome**: Player 2 reduces the number to 1 and **wins the game**!

#### **Sample Command-Line Interaction**

```plaintext
Game Start: The starting number is 100.

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number: 100
Available Divisors: 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
Enter your divisor, Player 1: 2
New Current Number is 50.

Player 2's Turn:
Current Number: 50
Available Divisors: 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
Enter your divisor, Player 2: 5
New Current Number is 10.

Player 1's Turn:
Current Number: 10
Available Divisors: 2, 5, 10
Enter your divisor, Player 1: 2
New Current Number is 5.

Player 2's Turn:
Current Number: 5
Available Divisors: 5
Enter your divisor, Player 2: 5
New Current Number is 1.
Player 2 reduces the number to 1 and wins the game!
```

### **Strategy Tips**

- **Plan Ahead**: Anticipate future moves by considering how your choice of divisor will affect the available options for your opponent.
- **Prime Numbers**: Try to force your opponent to encounter a prime number greater than 2 on their turn, limiting their options.
- **Divisor Selection**: Choosing smaller divisors may prolong the game, but strategic larger divisors can control the flow of the game.
