# **Range War** â€“ Rule Book

## **Objective**

Become the last player able to make a legal move by strategically selecting numbers from a shared number line. Force your opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move on their turn.

## **Setup**

1. **Shared Number Line**: The game uses a shared number line consisting of integers from **1** to **10**.
2. **Starting Conditions**:
   - All numbers from **1** to **10** are initially **unclaimed** and available for selection.
   - No numbers have been chosen yet, so there is no established sequence or trend.

## **Game Components**

- **Number Line**: Represents the pool of available numbers (1 to 10).
- **Claimed Numbers List**: Keeps track of numbers that have been selected and are no longer available.
- **Turn Indicator**: Tracks whose turn it is to play (Player 1 or Player 2).

## **Turns**

1. **Order of Play**:
   - Players decide who goes first (e.g., coin toss, agreement).
   - Players alternate turns throughout the game.

2. **Structure of a Turn**:
   - **Selection Phase**: The player selects an available number from the number line, following the game rules.
   - **Update Phase**: The selected number is marked as claimed and is no longer available.
   - **Announcement**: The player announces their chosen number and the current trend (up or down).

3. **Turn Progression**:
   - The game continues with players alternating turns until one player cannot make a legal move.
   - The last player to make a valid selection wins the game.

## **Rules and Mechanics**

### **Core Rules**

1. **First Move**:
   - The first player can select **any number** from 1 to 10.
   - No trend (up or down) is established on the first move.

2. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - **Establishing the Trend**:
     - After the first two moves, the sequence establishes a **trend** based on whether the most recent number is higher or lower than the previous one.
   - **Alternating Trend Requirement**:
     - Players must alternate the trend with each move:
       - If the last move increased the number (an **upward trend**), the next player must select a **lower** number than the previous one.
       - If the last move decreased the number (a **downward trend**), the next player must select a **higher** number than the previous one.

3. **Valid Moves**:
   - The selected number must:
     - **Not** have been previously claimed.
     - Satisfy the trend requirement (higher or lower than the previous number as dictated by the trend).

4. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player **wins** if their opponent cannot make a valid move on their turn.

5. **No Draws**:
   - Due to the finite set of numbers and the alternating trend rule, the game cannot end in a draw.

### **Examples of Valid and Invalid Moves**

- If the last trend was **up** (e.g., moving from 3 to 7), the next player must select a **lower** number than 7.
- If the last trend was **down** (e.g., moving from 8 to 4), the next player must select a **higher** number than 4.

## **Scoring**

- **Victory Condition**: Winning the game by making the last valid move.
- **No Point System**: The game does not involve points; victory is achieved through strategic play and forcing the opponent into an impossible position.
