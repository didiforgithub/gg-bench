The action space indices in the game map to possible moves by defining which bit(s) to flip in the shared binary number. There are 36 possible actions, corresponding to flipping one or two bits among the 8 bits:

- **Indices 0 to 7** represent flipping a single bit, where each index directly corresponds to flipping bit positions 0 through 7.
- **Indices 8 to 35** represent flipping pairs of bits, covering all combinations of two distinct bits from the 8 available positions. The pairs are generated in order such that for a lower bit position `i`, it is paired with every higher bit position `j` (i.e., `i=0` pairs with `j=1, 2, ..., 7`, then `i=1` pairs with `j=2, 3, ..., 7`, and so on).
