The action space indices in the game `GridLock` map to positions on the 5x5 grid using a flat, zero-based numbering system from 0 to 24. Each index corresponds to a specific cell on the grid, with indices calculated as `row * 5 + column`, where `row` and `column` range from 0 to 4. For example, index 0 represents the top-left cell (row 1, column 1), index 6 corresponds to the cell (row 2, column 2), and index 24 is the bottom-right cell (row 5, column 5). This flat index system allows players to specify moves using a single integer representing the desired grid position.
