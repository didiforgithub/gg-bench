In the `CustomEnv` gym environment for the Divisor Duel game, the action space is defined as a discrete space with `self.N_max + 1` possible actions, indexed from 0 up to `self.N_max`. Each index in this action space corresponds directly to a potential divisor (D) that a player can choose during their turn. Specifically, the chosen action (D) should be a proper divisor of the current number `N` such that `2 <= D < N` and `N % D == 0`. Actions indexed as 0 and 1 are invalid as moves because they do not meet the proper divisor criteria. Valid moves are those where `D` is a proper divisor as per the game's rules.
