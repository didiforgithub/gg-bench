The action space indices in the gym environment map directly to the numbers available in the game by adding 2 to the index. Since the game involves selecting numbers from 2 to 50, the indices range from 0 to 48, representing the numbers 2 through 50 inclusively. For instance, an action space index of 0 corresponds to the number 2, an index of 1 corresponds to the number 3, and so on, up to an index of 48, which corresponds to the number 50.
