In the provided gym environment for the game "Sum Race," the action space is defined as `spaces.Discrete(6)`, which means the actions are represented by indices ranging from 0 to 5. Each index corresponds to selecting one of the possible moves in the game, specifically choosing a number from 1 to 6. The mapping is straightforward: action index 0 corresponds to selecting number 1, action index 1 corresponds to selecting number 2, and so on up to action index 5, which corresponds to selecting number 6. This mapping is achieved by adding 1 to the action index to convert it into the corresponding game number.
