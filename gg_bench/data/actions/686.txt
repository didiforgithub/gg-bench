The action space in the Grid Lock gym environment consists of 16 discrete actions, each corresponding to a specific cell on the 4x4 grid. The cells are mapped linearly, with indices ranging from 0 to 15. An action's index is translated into a grid position using the formula: `row = index // 4` and `col = index % 4`. This allows the index to directly map to cells in a row-major order, where index 0 corresponds to the top-left corner (cell (0, 0)), index 1 to the cell to its right (cell (0, 1)), continuing row by row through to index 15, which corresponds to the bottom-right corner (cell (3, 3)).
